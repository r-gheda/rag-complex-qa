He also wrote the screenplay based on Claus Pavels Riis's 1850 musical\" Til S\u00e6ters: dramatisk Idyl med Sange\"( To the Mountain Pastures: A Dramatic Idyll with Singing). The plot of the musical was very thin and mostly served as an excuse to link together various dance performances accompanied by well- known Norwegian folk melodies. Ivarson therefore added more people to the story and a little more intrigue, but retained the basic mood of the musical. \" Til s\u00e6ters\" is an example of the folk romantic film genre that was popular in Norway in the 1920s.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born later, Til S\u00e6ters or Ruben Guthrie?": [

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini.
