Born in Bucharest, his parents were the poet Ioan S. Neni\u021bescu and his wife Elena (\"n\u00e9e\" \u0218tefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Neni\u021bescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in \"Noua revist\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103\". His first book of poetry, \"Denii\" (1919), was followed by \"Vraj\u0103\" (1923) and \"Ode italice\" (1925). His single volume of theatre was \"Trei mistere\" (1922). From 1924, he wrote for \"G\u00e2ndirea\", and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to \"Convorbiri LiterareIdeea european\u0103VremeaUniversul literarVia\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103Adev\u0103rul\" and \"Arta plastic\u0103\".

He translated from Benedetto Croce (\"Aesthetic\", 1922) and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (\"The Mandrake\", 1926). Initially, Neni\u021bescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the \"G\u00e2ndirist\" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume \"Ani\" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.\nDocument[2](Title: Ioan S. Neni\u021bescu) Ioan S.

He then studied at the philosophy faculty of Berlin University, taking a doctorate in 1887 at Leipzig University with a thesis on Baruch Spinoza. He worked as a schoolteacher and inspector in Bucharest. He traveled south of the Danube, a trip that resulted in an ample \"ethnic and statistical study of the AromaniansDe la rom\u00e2nii din Turcia European\u0103\", 1895). He sat in the Assembly of Deputies for his native Covurlui County, and also served as prefect of Tulcea County in the Dobruja region.

He was the son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea. He left the kingdom in 129 BC and went to the city of Cyzicus, but he returned in 116 BC to challenge his half-brother Antiochus VIII for power. The siblings fought a twenty-year civil war. In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC.\nDocument[3](Title: Antiochus X Eusebes) Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (\u201392 or 88 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)). He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).\n\nQuestion: Who is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?": [

Grand Duke Kirill followed a career in the Russian navy serving during twenty years in the Naval Guards. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War, barely surviving the sinking of the battleship at Port Arthur in April 1904. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They wed in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II prohibition. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honors, also initially banishing the couple from Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas II recognized their marriage. During World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards swearing allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government. During the rule of the provisional governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac. With the murder of his cousins Tsar Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today.

He was an educated man known for his lively wit and honesty, and he was an important figure in the poetry of the 1680s and 1690s. He was born in Oxfordshire, attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657. When all persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was \"not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability\" (Ellis 255). Instead, Sheppard became a courtier. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset). He would remain one of Dorset's closest friends throughout his life. While satirists and gossips (such as Anthony \u00e1 Wood) said that Sheppard spent his time as \"a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion,\" others suggested that he was a fundamentally honest man who was always interested in a good joke. He became one of Charles II's dining companions, and when Nell Gwynn gave birth to a male child, he was made the steward of Gwynn's household. This prompted a satirist to accuse him of being the best paid pimp in the land. There is little truth to this charge, however, as Sheppard was not paid by the crown for his services, except for two grants of \u00a3200. Dorset and Sheppard went to Paris together. Additionally, Dorset would travel out to meet Sheppard when the latter went out to the country. Whether he and Dorset got in trouble in Paris for some scandalous behaviour, as Wood suggests, or not, it is true that Sheppard lived a very active life. He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.\nDocument[3](Title: Who Cares?

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Watskeburt?!)

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\nDocument[2](Title: Where Are You?

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

He was also the third archbishop of Rouen from 755 to 762. Along with his brothers, he was denied any claim to the legacy of his father. He became archbishop during the reign of his half brother Pepin the Short. Remigius is also known as Saint Remigius. His feast day is January 19. He was instrumental in implementing the Roman rite and chant in the Gallic church. Remigius also accompanied Pepin to Italy in 760 with his two brothers (Bernard and Hieronymus) to mediate between Pope Paul I and Desiderius.\nDocument[2](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: What Are Little Girls Made Of?) \" What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" is the seventh episode of the of the American science fiction television series,.

He was therefore probably a grandson of Hidda and Christian of Thuringia and named for his great uncle Gero the Great. He succeeded his probable uncle, Hodo, as Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark including Mark Lausitz (Lusatia) in 993 upon the death of margrave of Lusatia Hodo or Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark. Gero was created Count of Hassegau in 992, just a year before becoming margrave. He died in his territory in battle with a Polish army of Boleslaw I in Gau Diadesi and was buried in his family's monastery of Nienburg. He was survived by his wife Adelaide (Athelheidhe) and one son, Thietmar, who succeeded him.\nDocument[2](Title: Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark) Odo( or Hodo) I( also\" Huodo\" or\" Huoto\")( c. 930 \u2013 13 March 993) was margrave in the Saxon Eastern March of the Holy Roman Empire from 965 until his death. Odo was, if the onomastics are correct, a son( or maybe a nephew) of Christian( d. 950), a Saxon count in the Nordth\u00fcringgau and Schwabengau of Eastphalia. Count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, had married Hidda( d. 970), a sister of Gero, margrave of the vast\" marca Geronis\" in the lands settled by Polabian Slavs. From 945 he also ruled over the adjacent gau of Serimunt beyond the Saale river. In 965, Margrave Gero died and his great\" marca Geronis\" was divided into five smaller marches. Count Thietmar, a known son of Hidda, and Odo inherited large parts of his march: Odo received the so- called\" marca Orientalis\" or Eastern March, stretching from the Gau Serimunt in the west up to the remotest outposts on the B\u00f3br river in the east, while Thietmar appeared as margrave of southern Meissen after 970. Both are buried at Nienburg Abbey, a foundation of Thietmar and his brother Archbishop Gero of Cologne, which too provides evidence of their probable relationship. As a young man, Margrave Odo had shared the tutorship of Otto's son( later Otto II) with the boy's step- uncle William, Archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop William taught literature and culture; Margrave Odo taught war and legal customs. Odo spent the first years of his rule subduing the Slavic tribes settling in the eastern parts of the Saxon Ostmark. He held comital rights in the gau of Nizizi, comprising the lands between the Mulde, Elbe and Black Elster rivers, and appeared with the title\" marchio\"( margrave) only in 974, though he had held further marcher territories( officially as a county) since 965. In that same year( 974), Odo was made Count in the Saxon Nordth\u00fcringgau, still rivalling with Margrave Thietmar. Odo is chiefly known for his quarrels with the Polish duke Mieszko I. The West Slavic Polans had established a state east of the Saxon marches and, aiming to advance into the Pomeranian lands north of the Warta river, had reached an agreement with late Margrave Gero and Emperor Otto I: Mieszko's ducal title was confirmed and the Polans paid a recurring tribute to the emperor, which was collected by Margrave Odo. The medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, apparently quite gladly, relates that Odo's reputation with Mieszko was such that the duke of Poland\" would not have dared while wearing his fur coat to enter a house where he knew the margrave to be, or to remain seated when the margrave stood up.\" When in 972 the Polans again marched for the Baltic trade centre of Wolin, they entered into open conflict with Odo. The margrave, intending to compel Mieszko to pay tribute for the Pomeranian territory between the Oder and Warta rivers, invaded that region. Aged Emperor Otto, engaged in the marriage of his son Otto II with Princess Theophanu at far- off Rome, ordered them to cease until he himself could arbitrate their dispute. However, Odo attacked Mieszko's forces and was defeated on 24 June at the Battle of Cedynia. The belligerents reconciled at the Imperial Diet in Quedlinburg one year later. In 983, Odo took part in the attempts to suppress the Great Slav Rising of the Polabian Lutici tribes, but was not able to prevent the loss of the Saxon Northern March.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

He was forfeited of his estates by James II in 1445, under the influence of his near cousin William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas. The Earl of Douglas was trying to consolidate the power which he had gained through the murder of his cousins at the \"Black Dinner\" at Edinburgh Castle, sanctioned by the king and his own father James the Gross, 7th Earl of Douglas. It has been suggested that the feud between the Black and Red Lines of the House of Douglas was encouraged by Bishop Kennedy of St. Andrews as a method of curtailing the power of unruly magnates, and ensuring continued Stewart reign. Kennedy was a first cousin through Angus' grandmother, Princess Mary of Scotland, a daughter of King Robert III. During his forfeiture, Angus was surprised at the reluctance of his tenantry to pay their Feus, he made a point of collecting them punctually in person. Angus died in 1446.

Chartered in February 1859, the railroad reached the Kansas- Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo, Colorado, in 1876. To create a demand for its services, the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farmland from the land grants that it was awarded by Congress. Despite the namesake, its mainline did not directly serve Santa Fe, due to the mountainous terrain, the metropolitan city of Albuquerque instead served New Mexico and the Santa Fe area. The Santa Fe was a pioneer in intermodal freight transport, an enterprise that( at one time or another) included a tugboat fleet and an airline, the short- lived Santa Fe Skyway. Its bus line extended passenger transportation to areas not accessible by rail, and ferryboats on the San Francisco Bay allowed travelers to complete their westward journeys to the Pacific Ocean.

For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common. In the view of art historian Gabrielle Langdon, \"Her story is valuable in revealing attitudes and legalities attendant on the lives and decorum of women in the early-modern Italian court\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Eleonora Di Garzia Di Toledo born?": [

He was born near the village R\u00e6lingen in Akershus, Norway. In 1859 he took over the family farm Ekeberg in the parish of Enebakk (\"Ekeberg g\u00e5rd i Enebakk\"). In 1866, he established J\u00f8lsens T\u00e6ndstikfabrik, which developed into one of the larger match factory in Norway in the 1870s, with about 300 employees. In 1886, the factory was re-located from Ekebergdalen to Bryn in Aker. In 1887 he established Enebak Cellulosefabrik, which was one of the first pulp mills in Norway. Following a large fire in 1893, J\u00f8lsen was bankrupt. Holm J\u00f8lsen was married to Pauline Lovise Holmsen (1836\u20131903). Their daughter Ragnhild J\u00f8lsen (1875-1908) was the subject of the book \"Dr\u00f8mmen og hjulet\" written by Jens Bj\u00f8rneboe and published in 1964.\nDocument[2](Title: Gideon Johnson Pillow) Gideon Johnson Pillow (June 8, 1806 \u2013 October 8, 1878) was an American lawyer, politician, speculator, slaveowner, United States Army major general of volunteers during the Mexican\u2013American War and Confederate brigadier general in the American Civil War. Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\nDocument[3](Title: Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: What Are Little Girls Made Of?) \" What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" is the seventh episode of the of the American science fiction television series,.

The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost out to\" Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\". Alan Bergman would recall that after Michel Legrand had written eight melodies which were somehow not viable for the film, Marilyn Bergman suggested the opening line\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\", and Legrand then completed the song's melody based on that phrase. Marilyn Bergman would later comment on the double meaning of the phrase\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" within its parent film: as the romantic theme song's title the question overtly references the marriage proposal Mary Spencer( played by Jean Simmons) received and accepted sixteen years earlier but, as Mary's present- day angst becomes apparent,\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" is recast as a question Mary must ask herself. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was sung in\" The Happy Ending\" by Michael Dees whose version was included on the film's soundtrack album. The first evident\" outside\" cover was by Barbra Streisand who recorded the song on 24 September 1969 in the first session for her intended album\" The Singer\", with the track having a single release 26 October 1969. After two later sessions- in respectively March and April of 1970- Streisand had recorded a total of eight tracks toward\" The Singer\", only to have Clive Davis shelve the project in favor of an album which was soft rock rather than easy listening, with Streisand cutting the first tracks for what would be her 1971 album release\" Stoney End\" on 29 July 1970. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was utilized as the B-side of Streisand's# 1 hit\" The Way We Were\" released in 1973, and was included on the 1974 album release\" The Way We Were\". Although the Streisand version drew no evident attention in its original single release,\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" did reach the Easy Listening Top 40 ranking in\" Billboard\"- with a# 40 peak- via a January 1970 recording by veteran vocalist Jaye P. Morgan, whose version served as the title cut for her first album release in eight years( and her last until 1976). Also in 1970\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was recorded by Della Reese for her album\" Right Now\": the 9 November 1997 broadcast of the CBS series\" Touched by an Angel\" featured Reese's character; the angel Tess, singing the song in the guise of a supperclub singer .. \" What Are Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was also recorded by Dusty Springfield in 1970, in the July sessions at Trident Studios( Soho) for her\" See All Her Faces\" album, but despite Springfield having had a Top 40 hit with the Bergman's first Oscar- winning composition\" The Windmills of Your Mind\" her version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was cut from her upcoming album without being mixed, remaining\" in the can\" until 1994 when Philips Records put together the four volume box set\" Dusty: The Legend Of Dusty Springfield\" with a completed recording of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" being included on the disc devoted to\" Rarities\"( the track was in fact first released earlier in the year as a bonus on a CD single which paired Springfield's hits\" Goin' Back\" and\" Son- of- a Preacher Man\").

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Watskeburt?!)

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Free at Last: The Movie) Free at Last: the Movie is the first DVD released by DC Talk.

Virtually nothing is known about his rule in Chiny. In 1024, Reginbert, the Bishop of Verdun, appointed Louis as Count of Verdun when Count Herman of Ename, son of Godfrey the Prisoner, retired to a monastery. Herman's nephew, Godfrey the Bearded, coveted the position, and Gothelo (Herman\u2019s brother and Godfrey\u2019s father) invaded the city and murdered Louis. Louis married Adelaide (d. after 1025), of unknown parentage. They had two children:\nLouis\u2019 son Louis II assumed the position of Count of Chiny after his father\u2019s death, and Godfrey the Bearded was appointed Count of Verdun.\nDocument[2](Title: Frederick, Count of Verdun) Frederick( Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric)( ca. 970- 6 January 1022), Count of Verdun( 988-1022), Count of Castres( 1000- 1022), and Provost of Saint- Vaast, was part of the Ardennes- Verdun dynasty. He was the eldest son of Godfrey I the Prisoner, Count of Verdun, and Matilda, daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony, of the Billung family, a widow of Baldwin III of Flanders. Frederick was among those captured along with his father in 985 when Lothair of France attacked Verdun in 985. He was released in 987 by family ally Hugh Capet, then Duke of the Franks(\" dux et princeps Francorum\"). In 988, Frederick worked to bring the body of his brother Adalberon, Bishop of Verdun, who died in Italy, to be buried in the Verdun Cathedral. It is uncertain how long Frederic remained as Count in Verdun as the charter dated 17 Aug 1156 of Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa indicates that the County of Verdun was transferred to the Bishop of Verdun during the reign of Emperor Otto III. However, a charter dated 1020, under which Haimont, Bishop of Verdun, confirmed an exchange of property, names\" domni Frederici\u2026 comes nostre civitatis\", which suggests that Frederic continued as count at least in part of the county. A 1020 charter of Abbot Richard demonstrates that Frederick must have resigned the countship soon after, as it refers to\" temporis dominus Fredericus qui comes Virdunensis civitatis fuerat\". Frederick was also Count of Castres, as shown by the charter dated 5 May 1005 under which Henry II, then King of Germany, granted market rights at\" Doncheria \u2026 in comitatu\u2026Frederici comitis\u2026Castricensis\" to the Abbey Saint- M\u00e9dard de Soissons. It is not known who his wife or wives were. He apparently had a daughter Sophie( b. ca 1010) who married Louis II, Count of Chiny. Louis' father, a successor of Frederick \u2019s as count, was murdered by Frederick \u2019s brother Gothelo. In 1020, near the end of his life, Frederick gave up his title and became a monk at Saint- Vanne Abbey. He was succeeded as Count of Verdun by his brother Herman.

He succeeded his brother Frederick as Count of Verdun in 1022. Little is known about Herman other than he fought valiantly at his father \u2019s side when Lothair of France attacked Verdun in 985, resulting in the capture of his father and brother Frederick. Herman and his brother Adalberon are credited with repulsing further progress of Lothair. Herman \u2019s father was Margrave of Ename and some credit Herman with the title Count of Ename. He was also Count of Brabant. Little is known about these positions or any successors. Herman first married Mathilde of unknown origins. Herman and Mathilde had three children: Herman married secondly Goda, again of unknown origins.

Nowhere is this balancing act more evident than on \"Rape,\" a rather disquieting extended metaphor for his mastery of hip-hop (other MCs just \"ain't fuckin' it right Primarily, the song is a satirical response to rapper Common's classic \"I Used to Love H.E.R.,\" a nostalgic song that features a feminized personification of hip-hop as a lost love that has fallen to vice. Pharoahe Monch's more graphic and violent rendition is accordingly a critique of the vapid state of contemporary mainstream hip-hop, conveyed from the perspective of a variously passionate or obsessed rapist, equally infatuated by hip-hop as a woman. As Huey points out, \"Rape\" equally is an extended metaphor for Pharoahe's technical mastery of hip-hop. Personification and extended metaphor are techniques widely employed by hip-hop lyricists.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Damage (Pharoahe Monch Song)?": [

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Watskeburt?!)

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Stopp!

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Epistemology) Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived \u2014 he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773\u20131778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).\nDocument[3](Title: Robert Adam) Robert Adam (3 July 1728 \u2013 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer.

With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the \"Adam Style\", and his theory of \"movement\" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death.

The brothers were made the senior earls in the royal court and had influential positions in the Parliament of England. Edmund was also granted Baynard's Castle, London and ran a successful estate. He was married to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, after her first marriage was annulled. Prior to the start of the Wars of the Roses, Edmund liaised with Richard of York and supported him when the King fell ill during 1453 and 1454.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Greg Craven (teacher)) Greg Craven is an American high school science teacher and climate change author.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Erling Lorentzen) Erling Sven Lorentzen (born 28 January 1923) is a Norwegian-Brazilian shipowner and industrialist.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: That's My Line) That's My Line is a summer CBS reality show developed by Mark Goodson, one of the creators of \"What's My Line?\".

Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.\nDocument[2](Title: Pepi II Neferkare) Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC \u2013 after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (\"Nefer-ka-Re\"), means \"Beautiful is the Ka of Re\". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks\u2014the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II\u2014were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: \"King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II\". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\nDocument[3](Title: Elizabeth Grant (songwriter)) Elizabeth Grant( later Murray)( 1745? \u20131814?) was a Scottish songwriter, from Carron, Speyside.

The first of Tati's films to be released in colour,\" Mon Oncle\" won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a Special Prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film, receiving more honors than any of Tati's other cinematic works. The film centers on the socially awkward yet lovable character of Monsieur Hulot and his quixotic struggle with postwar France's infatuation with modern architecture, mechanical efficiency and consumerism. As with most Tati films,\" Mon Oncle\" is largely a visual comedy; color and lighting are employed to help tell the story. The dialogue in\" Mon Oncle\" is barely audible, and largely subordinated to the role of a sound effect. The drifting noises of heated arguments and idle banter complement other sounds and the physical movements of the characters, intensifying comedic effect. The complex soundtrack also uses music to characterize environments, including a lively musical theme that represents Hulot's world of comical inefficiency and freedom. At its debut in 1958 in France,\" Mon Oncle\" was denounced by some critics for what they viewed as a reactionary or even\" poujadiste\" view of an emerging French consumer society, which had lately embraced a new wave of industrial modernization and a more rigid social structure. However, this criticism soon gave way in the face of the film's huge popularity in France and abroad \u2013 even in the U.S., where rampant discretionary consumption and a recession had caused those on both the right and the left to question the economic and social values of the era.

Two games were played each Christmas Day from 2004 to 2006 and then from 2016 to 2017. In recent years, the NFL has scheduled games on Christmas Day only if it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. If Christmas falls on a Sunday, the normal Sunday afternoon games are moved to Saturday, Christmas Eve, and one or two games are scheduled for Christmas night to be broadcast nationally. This situation most recently occurred in 2016 and will occur again in 2022. In rare cases when a game must be played on the evening of Christmas Eve, the game is typically hosted on the West Coast of the United States so that the game takes place in the late afternoon there, and likewise, games played in the late afternoon on Christmas Day are hosted in either the Eastern or Central time zones so that they do not start before 3:30 p.m. local time. This provides a window of roughly 20 hours of local time, spanning late Christmas Eve into Christmas Day, in which the league will not play.\nDocument[3](Title: National Football League Christmas games) After the NFL held two Divisional Playoff games on Christmas Day 1971, the league avoided any more games on Christmas Day until 1989.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as\" Irgum Tekle Haymanot\" or\" Tekle Haymanot the Cursed\" Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned. Tekle Haymanot quickly returned to Gondar, despite the difficulty of travel during the rainy season, forced the usurper to flee, and celebrated his triumph. Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or\" Era of the Princes\"( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.\n\nQuestion: Who is Tekle Haymanot Ii's paternal grandfather?": [

He was a younger son of \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in and became his father's chosen heir upon the death of his elder brothers. Adomn\u00e1n's \"Life of Saint Columba\" has Columba foresee that Eochaid, then a child, will succeed his father in preference to his adult brothers Art\u00far, Eochaid Find and Domangart. In the last two years of his reign, 627\u2013629, Eochaid was apparently co-ruler with Connad Cerr, who predeceased him. Eochaid was followed by his son Domnall Brecc. Eochaid's other sons named by the Senchus fer n-Alban are Conall Crandomna, Failbe (who died at the Battle of Fid Eoin), C\u00fa-cen-m\u00e1thair (whose death is reported in the Annals of Ulster for 604), Conall Bec, Connad or Conall Cerr (who may be the same person as Connad Cerr who died at Fid Eoin), Failbe, Domangart and Domnall Donn (not the same person as Domnall Donn unless his obituary is misplaced by 45 years like that of Ferchar mac Connaid) According to the \"Fled D\u00fain na nG\u00e9d\", Eochaid Buide was the grandfather of Congal C\u00e1ech. The story has anachronistic features as it has Eochaid alive at the time of the battle of Mag Rath (securely dated to within a year of 637), but it is chronologically feasible that Congal C\u00e1ech could have been the son of Eochaid's daughter if the identification of C\u00fa-cen-m\u00e1thair and the dating of his death is correct.\nDocument[2](Title: William A.

He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of \u00c6thelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when \u00c6thelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of \u00c6lfthryth who married King Edgar after \u00c6thelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta regum anglorum\" has a late account of \u00c6thelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter \u00c6lfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent \u00c6thelwald to see \u00c6lfthryth, ordering him \"to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report. \" When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, \u00c6thelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay \u00c6thelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed \u00c6thelwald. He asked \u00c6lfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed \u00c6thelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the \u00c6thelwald murder story as a \"tissue of romance\" in his \"Historic essays\", but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book \"Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn\". \u00c6thelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother \u00c6thelwine succeeded to his offices.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Joan Walsh) Joan Maureen Walsh is an American journalist who is the national affairs correspondent for\" The Nation\" and a political analyst at CNN.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Kenneth W.

Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways. C.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

Massey was the founder of the York Bible Class which attracted thousands of young people in the 1920s. His religious programs were broadcast on Toronto radio stations both before and after World War II. He served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative MP for the Toronto riding of Greenwood from 1935 to 1949 and was, in 1938, an unsuccessful candidate at the Conservative leadership convention. Massey joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940 and reached the rank of group captain. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his efforts during the war in 1946.

He has served in professorial and administrative posts at the University of California, University of Chicago, Brown University, and the University of Illinois. Throughout his more than forty years of professional life, Massey has been guided by two overarching principles: first, that science and technology are necessary to sustain the nation's quality of life and the standard of living of its citizens; and, second, that the general public's understanding of science and technology is a critical component of a democratic society. Massey's commitment to these principles has, among other areas of advocacy, additionally led him to be a proponent of the need for a strong system of national science education, as well as the need to enhance the representation of women and minorities in science and technology. Massey has focused on arts and design education at the college and K- 12 levels, working to improve student access to the arts and to highlight the important role they play in fostering student creativity and achievement. Massey is particularly interested in the intersections between the arts and sciences and in the ways broad exposure to both prepares students for future success and contributes to a more creative and dynamic society. Reflecting his diverse array of experience, Massey is the only individual to serve as both President and Chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science( AAAS) and as Chair of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design( AICAD).

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Venus Makes Trouble) Venus Makes Trouble is a 1937 American comedy film directed by Gordon Wiles.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Thru Your Phone?": [

Popular versions of \" How Deep Is the Ocean?\" in 1932 were by Guy Lombardo (vocal by Carmen Lombardo), Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra (with vocals by Jack Fulton), Rudy Vall\u00e9e and Ethel Merman.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Aleksandr Grave) Aleksandr Konstantinovich Grave( September 8, 1920 \u2013 March 5, 2010) was a Russian actor with a long and distinguished career who played over 150 roles at the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Watskeburt?!)

In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Claudia Rodr\u00edguez De Castellanos's husband?": [

This program was codenamed,\" In Houston 2\"( which was thought to be a successor to\" Paris By Night 36: In Houston\", before the title was announced). Before the main subject title was announced, the program was then codenamed to\" In Houston 2: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 3\"( the third Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series). The\" three\" was scrapped off the title and the subject was simply,\" Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\". Vietnamese composer, Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, is one of the Vietnamese community's most famous composers today; composing famous songs before and even after the Vietnam War, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Since the early years of\" Paris By Night\", Th\u00fay Nga has been making single- composer videos dedicated to just a single composer.

After being beloved by many, and his songs are in a timeless label, Th\u00fay Nga thought that he should deserve the entire program just dedicated to him and his songs, in a program that was meant for three composers. \" Paris By Night 88\" is Th\u00fay Nga's third live- performance show, after\" Paris By Night 86\" and\" Paris By Night 87\", which was the PBN Talent Show. This is a trend that Th\u00fay Nga may be beginning to adapt, after years of having singers lip- sync on stage, a practice that is common and accepted in the Vietnamese music community. \" Paris By Night 88\" used famous songs that was originally performed in\" Paris By Night 28\" and\" Paris By Night 22\", which were part of the Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Watskeburt?!)

Carl Gustaf Creutz was the youngest son of Lorentz Creutz Sr. and Elsa Jacob Daughter Duwall. He served as a page of Charles XI and experienced the Scanian War. By 1691 he was a captain in the Household Cavalry Regiment under Charles XII. The Great Northern War began in 1700 and Creutz landing in Zealand. He distinguished himself at the battles of Petschora and Kletsh (in present-day Poland). Promotions to major and lieutenant colonel then came quickly. Creutz became a colonel in 1704. The Battle of Poltava in 1709 brought Creutz command of the entire cavalry. However, he had to surrender soon after Perevolotnya. After Count Piper's death, he was the senior Swedish prisoner in Russia, of which his extant correspondence bears visible witness. In 1722, he was able to return to Sweden and service in the cavalry.\nDocument[2](Title: Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden) Carl XVI Gustaf (Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus; born 30 April 1946) is King of Sweden. He ascended the throne on the death of his grandfather, King Gustaf VI Adolf, on 15 September 1973. He is the youngest child and only son of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His father died on 26 January 1947 in an airplane crash in Denmark when Carl Gustaf was nine months old. Upon his father's death, he became second in line to the throne, after his grandfather, the then Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. Following the death of his great-grandfather King Gustaf V in 1950, Gustaf Adolf ascended the throne and thus Carl Gustaf became Sweden's new crown prince and heir apparent to the throne at the age of four. A short while after he became king in 1973, the new 1974 Instrument of Government took effect, formally stripping Carl XVI Gustaf of any role in the legislative process, and several other duties normally accorded to a head of state, such as the formal appointment of the prime minister, signing off legislation, and being commander-in-chief of the nation's military. The new instrument explicitly limits the king to ceremonial functions and, among other things, to be regularly informed of affairs of state. As head of the House of Bernadotte Carl Gustaf has also been able to make a number of government-supported decisions about the titles and positions of its members. The king's heir apparent, after passage on 1 January 1980 of a new law establishing absolute primogeniture (the first such law passed in European history), is Crown Princess Victoria, the eldest child of the King and his wife, Queen Silvia. Before the passage of that law, Crown Princess Victoria's younger brother, Prince Carl Philip, was briefly the heir apparent, as of his birth in May 1979. Carl XVI Gustaf is the longest-reigning monarch in Swedish history, having surpassed King Magnus IV's reign of 44 years and 222 days on 26 April 2018.\nDocument[3](Title: Battle of Kletsk (1706)) The Battle of Kletsk took place on 30 April 1706( Gregorian calendar), in- and outside the city of Kletsk, Belarus during Charles XII's Polish campaign of 1701 \u2013 1706, in the Great Northern War.

Van Huysum was baptized 25 February 1688 in Amsterdam. Both his father Justus van Huysum (1659\u20131716), and his brother Jan van Huysum (1682\u20131749), were celebrated flower painters. His manner of painting was very like that of his brother. His approach to botanical illustration, while preserving botanical accuracy, captured a more painterly aspect of his subject. This contrasts with the meticulously exact mode of Georg Dionysius Ehret, his contemporary colleague. Jacob arrived in England in about 1721, and for a while lived in the house of his patron, Mr. Lockyear of South Sea House. Later he enjoyed the patronage of Sir Robert Walpole, who befriended him, and commissioned him to paint decorative works for his house at Houghton in Norfolk. More importantly he produced most of the 50 illustrations for John Martyn's \"Historia Plantarum Rariorum\" (London: 1728-38), and all the drawings for \"Catalogus Plantarum\", an index of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers (London: 1730). His pupil was Louis Fabritius Dubourg. \"Historia Plantarum Rariorum\" depicted plants from the Chelsea Physic Garden and the Cambridge Botanic Garden. These plants had come from the Cape of Good Hope, North America, the West Indies, and Mexico. Elisha Kirkall produced the mezzotint engravings.

Van Huysum was baptized 25 February 1688 in Amsterdam. Both his father Justus van Huysum( 1659 \u2013 1716), and his brother Jan van Huysum( 1682 \u2013 1749), were celebrated flower painters. His manner of painting was very like that of his brother. His approach to botanical illustration, while preserving botanical accuracy, captured a more painterly aspect of his subject. This contrasts with the meticulously exact mode of Georg Dionysius Ehret, his contemporary colleague. Jacob arrived in England in about 1721, and for a while lived in the house of his patron, Mr. Lockyear of South Sea House. Later he enjoyed the patronage of Sir Robert Walpole, who befriended him, and commissioned him to paint decorative works for his house at Houghton in Norfolk. More importantly he produced most of the 50 illustrations for John Martyn's\" Historia Plantarum Rariorum\"( London: 1728- 38), and all the drawings for\" Catalogus Plantarum\", an index of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers( London: 1730). His pupil was Louis Fabritius Dubourg. \" Historia Plantarum Rariorum\" depicted plants from the Chelsea Physic Garden and the Cambridge Botanic Garden. These plants had come from the Cape of Good Hope, North America, the West Indies, and Mexico. Elisha Kirkall produced the mezzotint engravings.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: What Kind of an American are You?)

Muggeridge was born the son of a Penge undertaker on 26 June 1864. When the family was abandoned by his father, Muggeridge left school and began work as an office boy in the City of London. The little money he kept for himself was spent on books, and it was his avid lunchtime reading that led to a keen interest in politics. His second job was again as an office boy for a firm of shirtmakers, where he stayed until he retired. He eventually became Company Secretary, but had turned down a directorship, as he felt it would be at odds with his political principles. In 1893, Muggeridge married Annie Booler, the daughter of a Sheffield factory foreman, and they had five sons, Malcolm being the middle child. Malcolm would later describe his father as a small bearded man with a large frame, a twinkling eye, and a rather bulbous nose. One of Malcolm's quoted memories of his father is of his visits to the Surrey Street Market, where he would set up his platform and expound his views on the need for socialism:\" Now ladies and gentlemen. It's His Majesty's Government, His Majesty's Navy, His Majesty's Stationery Office, His Majesty's this and His Majesty's that. But it's the National Debt. Why is n't that His Majesty's? We'll gladly let His Majesty have that, wo n't we?\" Muggeridge's early interest in politics at first led to his joining the Penge Liberals, and with them he campaigned for local improvements. By his late twenties he was a socialist, and he joined first the Fabians, then the Independent Labour Party. An excellent public speaker, he founded and became secretary of the Croydon Socialist Society in 1895, and stood for the Croydon Borough Council in Norwood in 1896 and 1897. He was not to be successful until November 1911, although Croydon had already had several Labour councillors. Muggeridge was the first President of Ruskin House, the Labour and Trade Union centre in Croydon, having been instrumental in its relocation and refounding. Muggeridge remained a Croydon councillor until 1930, at which time he also became a Justice of the Peace. He was instrumental in getting Croydon's first council houses built and campaigned for Trade Union rates of pay for all municipal employees. Although he stood for Parliament in Croydon South four times, in 1918, 1922, 1923, and 1924, Muggeridge finally became a member of parliament for Romford in 1929. He lost his seat in 1931 and returned to Croydon Council in 1933, retiring in 1940, at the age of 75. He died in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1942 and was buried in Whatlington, near Battle, East Sussex.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born later, I'Ll Take Sweden or His Majesty, The American?": [

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Watskeburt?!)

Victor- Maurice de Broglie was born in the De Broglie house, a noble family originally from Piedmont. He was the son of Fran\u00e7ois- Marie, comte de Broglie and Angelique de Vassal, Countess of Favria. After the death of his father he inherited the countships of Revel and de Broglie, the marquisate of Senonches and also received the Government of La Bassee, near Lille. He served under Cond\u00e9, Turenne, and other commanders of the age of Louis XIV in the Franco- Dutch War and other conflicts. He was named\" mar\u00e9chal de camp\" in 1676, lieutenant- general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in 1724, just three years before his death. He had three sons, one of whom predeceased him.

In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave \u2013 particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics. De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave- like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927. The 1925 pilot- wave model, and the wave- like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot- wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm. Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high- level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research( CERN).\nDocument[3](Title: Victor-Fran\u00e7ois, 8th duc de Broglie) Victor-Fran\u00e7ois Marie L\u00e9on, 8th duc de Broglie (25 March 1949, in Paris \u2013 12 February 2012, in Broglie) was a French aristocrat and holder of the title of duc de Broglie.

Lewis has performed the song on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and it was included on the set list of her debut concert tour, The Labyrinth (2010).\nDocument[2](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Watskeburt?!)

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\n\nQuestion: Who is Shepseskare's paternal grandmother?": [

She was the stepdaughter of Mark Antony and half-sister of Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Iullus Antonius.\nDocument[2](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Clodia Pulchra (wife of Octavian)) Clodia Pulchra( born 57 BC/ 56 BC), also known as Claudia, was the daughter of Fulvia by her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: What Are Little Girls Made Of?) \" What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" is the seventh episode of the of the American science fiction television series,.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Epistemology) Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.

In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

He began his vocal studies in his native city in 1814 and made his stage debut there in 1821. He quickly made a specialty of Rossini roles, singing in\" Il barbiere di SivigliaTancrediLa cenerentola La gazza ladraSemiramide\", etc. He created for Donizetti the roles of Olivo in\" Olivo e Pasquale\" in 1827, and of Azzo in\" Parisina\" in 1833, also creating the role of Arnoldo in Pacini's\" Carlo di Borgogna\", in 1835. Cosselli was one of the first singers to make the transition between the old conception of the bass vocal range to what we know today as the baritone, a voice type that was still in its infancy. For Donizetti again, he created the role of Enrico in the highly successful\" Lucia di Lammermoor\", at the San Carlo in Naples, in 1835, giving to the role a new dramatic dimension, looking forward to what was to become known as the Verdi-baritone; the standard published score of Lucia contains several downward transpositions which mask the consistently high tessitura of the role as written for Cosselli.

His rule was confined to the western half, as eastern Mercia was then part of the Viking- ruled Danelaw. \u00c6thelred's ancestry is unknown. He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881, and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. The alliance was cemented by the marriage of \u00c6thelred to Alfred's daughter \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. In 886 Alfred took possession of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; as it had traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to \u00c6thelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year \u00c6thelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, \u00c6thelred's health may have declined, and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d may have become the effective ruler of Mercia. After \u00c6thelred's death, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918. The couple's only child, a daughter called \u00c6lfwynn, then ruled briefly until deposed by her uncle, King Edward.\nDocument[2](Title: \u00c6thelred of Mercia) \u00c6thelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, \u00c6thelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. \u00c6thelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; \u00c6thelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. \u00c6thelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 \u00c6thelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. \u00c6thelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was \u00c6thelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that \u00c6thelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.\nDocument[3](Title: \u00c6lfwynn) \u00c6lfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Breed of the Border (1924 film)) Breed of the Border is a 1924 American silent western film directed by Harry Garson and starring Maurice 'Lefty' Flynn, Dorothy Dwan and Louise Carver.\nDocument[3](Title: Breed of the Border (1924 film)) Breed of the Border is a 1924 American silent western film directed by Harry Garson and starring Maurice' Lefty' Flynn, Dorothy Dwan and Louise Carver.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Breed Of The Border (1924 Film)?": [

Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg was the daughter of Duke Wenceslas I of Saxe-Wittenberg, Duke of L\u00fcneburg and Elector of Saxony and his wife Cecilia of Carrara. In 1386 she married with Duke Frederick I of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. They had two daughters. In 1400 Frederick was elected King of the Germans. This election, however, was not recognized by three of the electors. Frederick was murdered on the way home, a month after the election.

This marriage remained childless.\nDocument[2](Title: Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg, Duke of L\u00fcneburg) Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg (died 28 June 1385 in Wittenberg) was born as the son of Otto (d. 30 March 1350), a younger son of the prince-elector Rudolf I of Saxe-Wittenberg, and his (Otto's) wife Elisabeth, daughter of Duke William II of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. In 1370 he succeeded his (maternal) grandfather as the Duke or Prince of L\u00fcneburg. William II of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg named his grandson Albert as his heir in L\u00fcneburg because neither he or his brother had male heirs. In fact William II had previously asked Emperor Charles IV for the eventual enfeoffment of the state to his grandson, but backed away again in the years that followed, because he feared the influence of Albert's uncles, Wenceslas I and Rudolf II. A further reason may be found in the terms of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg investiture agreement of 1235 as well as the succession treaties agreed by William's father Otto the Strict with Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg's Wolfenb\u00fcttel line of the House of Welf, according to which the principality had to be passed to any male heir within the entire Welf house if there were one. After the death of William II and the succession of the Wolfenb\u00fcttel Magnus II, the L\u00fcneburg War of Succession broke out between Saxe-Wittenberg and Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Albert was backed by his uncle the Prince-Elector Wenceslas of Saxony (Saxe-Wittenberg). On 25 July 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle near Leveste on the Deister (part of modern-day Gehrden). After this an arrangement was agreed between Prince-Elector Wenceslas and Albert, on the one hand and the widow of Magnus II and her sons on the other. It was agreed that the land would belong, undivided, to the two Ascanians from Saxe-Wittenberg and, after their deaths, would be transferred to the sons of the fallen duke, Magnus II. And that it should continue to alternate after the deaths of the Welfs, i.e. the succession would pass to the Ascanians again. In order that this plan could also be reinforced by family ties, in 1374 Albert of Saxe-L\u00fcneburg married the widow of Magnus II, Catharina and chose Celle as his home, which he made a residence in 1378. The two still underage sons of Magnus also married into the House of Ascania in 1386.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Veteran Cosmic Rocker) \"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\" is a 1981 song by the progressive rock band the Moody Blues.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).

It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Motherland (disambiguation)) Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: What Are Little Girls Made Of?) \" What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" is the seventh episode of the of the American science fiction television series,.

Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was\" Wake Up, Jacob\" which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith,\" Anthology of American Folk Music\", in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song,\" Oklahoma Rag\" was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled\" Memories of Prince Albert Hunt\" was released and was centered on the musician's life.\nDocument[3](Title: Leopold III of Belgium) Prince Leopold was born in Brussels, the first child of King Albert I of the Belgians and his consort, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Watskeburt?!)
