Her birth was greeted with caution; in the previous two years, Maria Josepha had suffered stillbirths and her health was of a fragile nature. Louis XV, on the other hand, had hoped for a grandson. Marie Isabelle de Rohan served as Marie Z\u00e9phyrine's governess.

Tulard was one of the experts involved in verifying the heart believed to be that of Louis XVII of France, actually the Dauphin of France as the heir apparent to the throne, who died in 1795 in imprisonment. Scientists using DNA samples from Queen Anne of Romania, and her brother Andre de Bourbon- Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie- Antoinette's hair, proved the young royal's identity. Historic evidence as to the location of the heart over the decades was also considered. In a summary of the investigation in 2004, Tulard wrote:\" This heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII. We can never be 100 per cent sure but this is about as sure as it gets\".

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\nDocument[3](Title: Antoine Gay) Antoine Gay( May 31, 1790 \u2013 June 13, 1871) was a Frenchman who was believed by some to have been possessed by a demon named Isacaron.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Alexandre Gaydamak born?": [

One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?": [

He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name \"Jack Sparrow\"; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, \"a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate.\" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, \"He's ruining the film!\" Depp answered back, \"Look, these are the choices I made.

Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30\u201335 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu.

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\nDocument[2](Title: Shepseskaf) Shepseskaf was the sixth and last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom.

The Indonesian title is a play on words, as\" Cinta\"( Indonesian for\" love\") is also the name of the main character. As such, the title can be translated as\" What's Up with Love?\" as well as\" What's Up with Cinta?\", meaning the person. The film is coloured with Indonesian mainstream as well as sidestream values, elements of classical culture and politics, and real issues encountered in teen life. The film raised censorship controversies among conservative Muslims in Indonesia, being the first Indonesian teen movie that featured a scene of a passionate kiss. The movie is known as\" Beautiful Days\" in Japan. Shortly after its success,\" What's Up with Love?\" was adapted into a sinetron( soap opera) version. In 2014, Japanese chatting application LINE released a promotional short film featuring the cast of\" What's Up with Love?\" titled\" Ada Apa dengan Cinta? 2014\" that portrays Rangga contacting Cinta via LINE after 12 years. The short's success led to a full- length feature film sequel,\" Ada Apa Dengan Cinta? 2\" in 2016 that serves as an official follow up to this movie, ignoring the events from the short film.

It is the sequel to the 2002 cult classic romance\" Ada Apa dengan Cinta?\" with Dian Sastrowardoyo and Nicholas Saputra reprising their roles as Cinta and Rangga. The film takes place 14 years after the events of the first film and tells how Cinta and Rangga are dealing with their lives after their off screen break- up before finally meeting each other again as old unresolved sparks and feelings begin to emerge from both former lovers. The film was made after the immense reception of LINE's promotional short film that featuring\" AADC\" s cast, which got many people to ask Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza to create a feature- length sequel for the beloved teen romance. As a result, the film was officially developed. The film ignores all the events in\" AADC? 2014\", such as Cinta and Rangga both having different jobs than in the short, and despite actress reprising her role in the short, she could n't appear in the feature sequel and her character was written out as having died in this film. Highly anticipated, the film was released on 28 April 2016 simultaneously in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam. The film was released to critical and commercial success.
