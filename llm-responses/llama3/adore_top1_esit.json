Born in Bucharest, his parents were the poet Ioan S. Neni\u021bescu and his wife Elena (\"n\u00e9e\" \u0218tefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Neni\u021bescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in \"Noua revist\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103\". His first book of poetry, \"Denii\" (1919), was followed by \"Vraj\u0103\" (1923) and \"Ode italice\" (1925). His single volume of theatre was \"Trei mistere\" (1922). From 1924, he wrote for \"G\u00e2ndirea\", and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to \"Convorbiri LiterareIdeea european\u0103VremeaUniversul literarVia\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103Adev\u0103rul\" and \"Arta plastic\u0103\".

He translated from Benedetto Croce (\"Aesthetic\", 1922) and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (\"The Mandrake\", 1926). Initially, Neni\u021bescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the \"G\u00e2ndirist\" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume \"Ani\" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of \u0218tefan I.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Antiochus X Eusebes) Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator( \u201392 or 88 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC( 224 SE( Seleucid year)). He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95 BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half- brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE( 89/88 BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE( 88/87 BC).\n\nQuestion: Who is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?": [

During World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards swearing allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government. During the rule of the provisional governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac.

Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today.

Clouzot also directed documentary films, including\" The Mystery of Picasso\", which was declared a national treasure by the government of France. Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French- language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German- owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film\" Le Corbeau\" drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including\" Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\". After the release of his comedy film\" Miquette et sa m\u00e8re\", Clouzot married V\u00e9ra Gibson- Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for\" The Wages of Fear\" and\" Les Diaboliques\". Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later.

In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Alexandre Gaydamak born?": [

Formed in 1997, the group originally featured vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, lead guitarist Ben Weinman, rhythm guitarist Derek Brantley, bassist Adam Doll and drummer Chris Pennie, although Brantley left after only two shows. The remaining four members recorded the band's self-titled debut EP in 1997, before John Fulton replaced Brantley for the subsequent tour and 1998's \"Under the Running Board\". Shortly after the second EP's release, Fulton left the band due to \"creative differences\", and in early 1999 Doll was forced to cease involvement due to a spinal injury suffered in a road traffic accident. As a result, Weinman performed all guitars and bass on the band's full-length debut album \"Calculating Infinity\", released in 1999. Following the release of \"Calculating Infinity\", Brian Benoit replaced Fulton and Jeff Wood took Doll's place; Wood left the band in 2000 due to the ongoing effects of a gunshot wound to the head sustained in 1992, and was replaced by Liam Wilson. In April 2001, it was announced that Minakakis had decided to leave The Dillinger Escape Plan to pursue \"non-music related endeavors\", with the band briefly placed on hiatus. The vocalist was replaced later in the year by Greg Puciato, who was chosen from \"over one hundred\" singers who auditioned by submitting a recording of \"43% Burnt\" to the band. In between the departure of Minakakis and the addition of Puciato, the band recorded the EP \"Irony Is a Dead Scene\" with Faith No More and Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, which was released in 2002. In 2004, the band released its first album with Puciato on vocals, \"Miss Machine\". Later in the year, Benoit suffered nerve damage in his left hand which affected his ability to play guitar; after attempting to continue, he was forced to leave the band in April 2005 and was replaced by James Love. During a tour in 2006, tensions arose between Weinman and Pennie, with the guitarist briefly leaving the band citing \"undisclosed personal reasons\". Pennie eventually left the band in 2007 to join Coheed and Cambria, with Gil Sharone replacing him for the band's third album \"Ire Works\". Also in 2007, guitarist Jeff Tuttle was added to the band due to Love's unavailability. By the beginning of 2009, Sharone had left the band and been replaced by Billy Rymer. \" Option Paralysis\" was released in 2010, which marked Tuttle's first contribution to the band (he performed additional vocals, with Weinman recording all guitars). The guitarist later left the band in August 2012 to attend film school. Love rejoined the band as Tuttle's replacement, although was not featured on the 2013 album \" One of Us Is the Killer\". After a brief hiatus, Love was replaced by Kevin Antreassian in 2015. The band released \"Dissociation\" in 2016, which was presented as the group's final album before embarking on an indefinite hiatus the following year. In the liner notes of \"Dissociation\" the band listed everyone who was a member or a part of the band in some other way or another.

Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common.

Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Gideon Johnson Pillow or Holm J\u00f8lsen?": [

On several of his independent films he is credited both as a director, producer and writer and on occasion as \"Rafael Zelinsky\" and/or \"Rafal Haimovitz\". His early years were spent in Eastern Europe. Born of a Polish father, an engineer and a pioneer in pre-fabricated housing, and mother of Jewish roots, an architect, his childhood was spent in several countries where his father worked for the Ford Foundation. While in grade-school he travelled several times around the world and gained a global perspective, an 8mm camera always at his eye. He was schooled in North America, the Middle East and the Orient.

After graduating from MIT he went on to direct several award-winning documentaries, gradually moving towards drama and becoming more and more interested in story-telling. As an independent filmmaker, Zielinski has always generated his own projects either by creating an original story that he was passionate about then collaborating with several screenwriters or adapting works from the theater in collaboration with the respective playwright. On most of the independent films that he directed he also served as his own producer often producing through his own company. His first feature \"Hey Babe\" opened the Taormina Film Festival, and showed at Toronto, Montreal and AFI Film Festival. \"Fun\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received two Special Jury Awards for Acting Achievement and went on to show at the Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver as well as other international film festivals including Sydney, Edinburgh, Munich, Vienna, London, Cambridge, Stockholm, S\u00e3o Paulo, Hawaii, Hamburg, Rimini, Mill Valley, San Jose, Warsaw, Oslo and Wales.

One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?": [

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: R\u0119ce do g\u00f3ry) R\u0119ce do g\u00f3ry (known in its subtitled English version as Hands Up!) is a Polish drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his \"alter ego\", Andrzej Leszczyc. At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by studio. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schloendorff's German film \"Die F\u00e4lschung (Circle of Deceit)\", and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of \"Solidarnosc\", Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work \"Kosmogonia\" by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumil Kobiela, who died in 1969. The film was screened out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nQuestion: Where did the director of film R\u0119ce Do G\u00f3ry study?": [

She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the spring of 2004 and died, aged 52, on October 20, 2004. She taught film making and editing in the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison until her death. She was born in 1952 and raised near Boston, Massachusetts. She received her BA in 1975 in Germanic linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and her Master of Fine Arts in film production from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1979. While at UCLA she served as a research assistant in Old Icelandic language and linguistics under Dr. Jesse Byock. Keene worked in various capacities in the film industry in Los Angeles while attending graduate school, including positions as a recordist for a sound studio, a dialogue editor in a post-production house, a projectionist, and a re-recording mixer at UCLA. She produced three short films as a graduate student \u2013 \"Friends\" (1977), \"Still\" (1978) and \"Hinterland\" (1983). In 1986 after returning from her Fulbright year she wrote the script for \"The Juniper Tree\" and returned to shoot the film in 1987 on location in Iceland. It was the first film to star the well-known singer and actress Bj\u00f6rk, in the role of a young child in a story based on a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm. She won a Verna Fields Memorial Scholarship from UCLA in 1987 for editing \"The Juniper Tree\", completing it in 1989.

The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983. The film was shot in Louisville and in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder. De Palma dedicated this version of\" Scarface\" after the writers of the original, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht. \" Scarface\" was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed$ 44 million at the domestic box office and$ 65.9 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever.

The lyrics explore the pressure Bj\u00f6rk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of \"Homogenic\"; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Bj\u00f6rk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most music critics were enticed by \"Hunter\", which they declared one of the highlights of the \"Homogenic\" album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video for \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Bj\u00f6rk as she transforms into a \"techno-bear\" while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Arruns Tarquinius (brother of Tarquin the Proud)) Arruns Tarquinius was the brother of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome. According to most ancient authors, Arruns and his brother were the sons of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king, and Tanaquil. However, in some sources they are described as grandsons; their father may have been a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius, who according to an Etruscan tradition was defeated and killed by the heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, together with a certain\" Macstarna\". Apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin word\" magister\", Macstarna has been identified with Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome. According to legend, Servius had come to the palace as a child, following the capture of Corniculum by Tarquinius Priscus. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, discovered his potential for greatness by various omens. When the elder Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil gave out that he was merely wounded, and installed Servius as regent, preferring him to her own sons. The Etruscan tradition may preserve an account of a revolt by Tarquin's sons against Servius' magistracy. Servius married a daughter of the elder Tarquin, and in turn he gave his own daughters to Arruns and Lucius Tarquinius. Arruns Tarquinius was mild and unassuming, while his brother was ambitious. Arruns' wife, known to history as Tullia Minor, as she was the younger daughter, was similarly ambitious, while her elder sister was not. Tullia sought to place her husband on the throne, which would require her father's death. But as Arruns lacked the ambition to overthrow his father- in- law, Tullia contrived his murder, and that of her own sister, that she might marry Lucius.

In the 1970s, he directed \"Vampire Circus\" (1972), \"Soldier's Home\" (1977) and \"Hammer House of Horror\". He directed several episodes of \"Minder\" and \"Bergerac\" in the early 1980s, and the acclaimed TV serial \"The Mad Death\" which centred on a rabies outbreak. Perhaps his best remembered television work was on \"Robin of Sherwood\", for which he directed many of the best-regarded episodes. Young moved towards black comedy in the early 1990s, directing \"Jeeves and Wooster\" based on the stories written by P.G. Wodehouse, and \"G.B.H.\", for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award. It was partly on the strength of \"GBH\" that he was assigned to direct \"Fierce Creatures\", John Cleese's 1997 follow-up to \"A Fish Called Wanda\", which featured many of the same cast as \"GBH\".

John III became Regent of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg in 1521, and Lord of Ravensberg in 1528. John represented a compensatory attitude, which strove for a , a middle way, between the two confessions during the Protestant Reformation. Despite what others may have thought, not all Germanic princely houses were Lutheran Protestant. In fact the real influence at the court of Cleves was Erasmus. Many of his men were friends and followers of this well-educated Dutch scholar and theologian. When Duke John decided to write up a list of church regulations, Erasmus was the first person the Duke went to personally for consultation and approval. Duke John had an instinct for balance as was shown when he married his eldest daughter Sybille to John Frederick of Saxony. John Frederick would go on to later head the Schmalkaldic League. In many ways John of Cleves' court was ideal for raising a Queen. It was fundamentally liberal, but serious-minded, theologically inclined, profoundly Erasmian; as the court of Catherine of Aragon had once been.

His name means \"little Anthemius\" and is a diminutive of his and his father's name Anthemius, in order to distinguish them both. His life is known only from the \"Chronica Gallica of 511\". He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals \u2014 Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus \u2014 in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The \"Chronica\", in entry 649, states: Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, \"comes\" [or \"comitesstabuli\": King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone and, having killed the \"duces\", laid everything waste. According to the \"Chronica\", this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471\u2013472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near D\u00e9ols.

Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and bounced around as a performer and DJ on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI, KLLL, in Coolidge, Arizona, and Phoenix. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings's first recording session, and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the ill-fated flight in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, J. P. \" The Big Bopper\" Richardson and Ritchie Valens. Jennings formed a rockabilly club band, The Waylors, which became the house band at \"JD's\", a club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and A&M Records, but did not achieve success until moving to RCA Victor, taking on Neil Reshen as a manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts for him. After finally wresting creative control from RCA Victor, his career turning point became the critically acclaimed albums \"Lonesome, On'ry and Mean\" and \"Honky Tonk Heroes\", followed by hit LPs \"Dreaming My Dreams\" and \"Are You Ready for the Country\". During the 1970s, Jennings was instrumental in the inception of outlaw country and with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter recorded country music's first platinum album, \"Wanted! The Outlaws\". It was followed by \"Ol' Waylon\" and the hit song \"Luckenbach, Texas\". Jennings was featured in the 1978 album \"White Mansions\", performed by various artists documenting the lives of people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Jennings also appeared in films and television series, including Sesame Street, and a stint as the balladeer for \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", composing and singing the show's theme song and providing narration for the show. By the early 1980s, Jennings struggled with a cocaine addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album \"Will the Wolf Survive\". He toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. In 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

He was the son of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde and Honora Burke. Knighted in 1602 for his exploits as leader of the English cavalry during the Battle of Kinsale, he would later serve as Governor of Connaught from 1604 to 1616, and as a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. Having established himself as the largest and most influential landowner in Connacht, his later life was characterized by animosity between him and an increasingly hostile and acquisitive Dublin government. He actively served Queen Elizabeth I against the rebel Irish lordships and their Spanish allies during the Nine Years' War. He was appointed governor of Connaught, member of the privy council in Ireland, and, in 1624, created Viscount Tunbridge and Baron of Somerhill, a manor which he owned in Kent. The titles of Viscount Galway and Earl of St. Albans were conferred on him in 1628. By 1633 he was not only one of the principal landowners in Ireland, but virtually all powerful in County Galway. This aroused the resentment of the Dublin Government, which decided to use the method of empanelling juries to \"find\" defective titles, in order to recover the lands in question for the English Crown. The treatment which Lord Clanricarde experienced from the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, was said to have accelerated his death in November 1635: Wentworth however pointed to the Earl's advancing years and asked sarcastically if he was to blame for a man being over sixty. The feud, which was continued by Clanricarde's son and heir, was in the long run very damaging to Strafford, who apparently did not reflect on the close connections Clanricarde, through his wife, had with just that faction of the English nobility, the Rich-Devereux clan, who were most hostile to Strafford. In 1603, he married Frances Walsingham, the widow of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. They had one son, Ulick, and two daughters, Honora, who married John Paulet, 5th Marquis of Winchester, and Mary, wife of Hon. Edward Butler of Ballinahinch.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: John II of Baden) John II of Baden (1434 at Hohenbaden Castle in Baden-Baden \u2013 9 February 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein) was a titular Margrave of Baden and was Archbishop and Elector of Trier as \"John II of Baden\" from 1456 until his death in 1503. John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as \"John II of Baden\". His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II's reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law. In 1477, he officiated in the wedding of Maximilian of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co-adjutor with the right to succeed  and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier. He was buried in the Cathedral of Trier in a magnificent grave that he had built during his lifetime.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of John Ii Of Baden?": [

It was shot mostly at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of $800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of urban sprawl to give the film an apocalyptic feel. The reasonable budget allowed Araki to hire professional crew, making it the first of his films not shot by himself.

During the press screening, many of the critics walked out.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \"Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film, \"The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's \"Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\" (1925). \"The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, \"Wara Wara\" (1930) and \"Hacia la Gloria\" (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and \"Wara Wara\" remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is \"Amerindia\" (1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas.

Catherine of Guelders was the fourth and youngest child of Arnold, Duke of Guelders (1410-1473) and Catherine of Cleves (1417\u20131479).<br > Until 1477, she led an inconspicuous life, in the shadow of her brother Adolf, at war with his father, and her sisters Mary, married to King James II of Scotland and Margaret, married to Frederick I, Count Palatine of Simmern.<br > Despite efforts by her father, no suitable husband was found for Catherine.<br> 17th century theories that she was secretly married with Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, are now believed to be false. Everything changed for Catherine in 1477, when Charles the Bold was killed in the Battle of Nancy. Guelders had been under control of Charles the Bold since 1473, and now saw the chance to regain its independence. As her brother Adolf was in Flanders, the States of Guelders convinced him to appoint his sister Catherine as regent, pending his return. Catherine reluctantly agreed.

They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived \u2014 he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773\u20131778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of James Adam (Architect)'s father?": [

The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. Upon release, \"Absolute Beginners\" received immense coverage in the British media. At the time, the British film industry was perceived as being on the point of collapse (with the recent failure of the film \"Revolution\"). However, the film was panned by critics and became a box office bomb. Some of the criticisms included stylistic anachronisms, such as the mini-skirt and decidedly 1980s music from the likes of The Style Council and Sade, the bowdlerisation of Kensit's character (Crepe Suzette had been depicted as a promiscuous \"negrophile\" in the book), and the casting of Bowie, who made it a condition of his musical contribution. Although the film was not a success, Bowie's theme song was very popular in the UK and reached number two in the charts.

The show consisted of 17 young women competing for an internship at and a college scholarship. Atoosa Rubenstein was the main judge, she was the youngest editor-in-chief ever to run \"Seventeen magazine\". They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice \u2014 they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition. The winner would get her face on the cover of \"Seventeen magazine\", a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly \u2014 Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons \u2014 video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest.

He negotiated the Treaty of Glarentsa with the Byzantine Empire in 1290. The situation for the Franks in Greece was hopeless by this time, however. The fall of the Angevins in Sicily meant that they were preoccupied with recouping territory there and few Western governments would send troops to defend Morea. Florent thus made peace and maintained it until 1293, when the Greeks retook Kalamata. Florent did not despair and did not reopen the war which had been ongoing until his succession: he instead sent an embassy in protest to Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the emperor returned Kalamata.

In 1870, he discovered one of the most important units of Cenozoic fossils in Brazil: Pirabas. He also made important archaeological discoveries that 20th century archaeologists confirmed. In three letters published by the National Museum( 1876 a, 1876 b, 1877), recorded his observations on the shell mounds installed in the dark and swampy regions on the east coast of Para, which he excavated, measured, and mapped, making notes on their condition, conservation, and archeological conditions- human bones, lithic and ceramic artefacts- describing them and locating them in their stratigraphic layers. He correctly identified the coastal and riverine shellmounds of Para as villages inhabited by early fishing people, an insight that scientific archaeologists confirmed in the 1990s. Always sharing his knowledge with other scholars, he urged geologist Charles Hartt to study the shellmound of Taperinha. About 100 years later, Taperinha and several other fluvial shellmounds with pottery in the Lower Amazon were shown through radiocarbon dating and luminescence dating to be early Holocene in age, c. 9.000 to 7,000 BP calibrated, making them the earliest pottery sites yet known in the Americas and among the earliest in the world.

He and his sister Aemilia Lepida were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula's elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married to Caligula's younger sister Julia Drusilla). He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried. The motion was carried and Lepidus was not given a proper burial.\n\nQuestion: Who is Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Executed 39)'s father-in-law?": [

The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983. The film was shot in Louisville and in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder. De Palma dedicated this version of\" Scarface\" after the writers of the original, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht. \" Scarface\" was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed$ 44 million at the domestic box office and$ 65.9 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever.

Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or\" Era of the Princes\"( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.\n\nQuestion: Who is Tekle Haymanot Ii's paternal grandfather?": [

A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace, he was a recipient of the \"Pour le M\u00e9riteThe Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 1 (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen. An early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in Adolf Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to morphine which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the Gestapo, which he ceded to Heinrich Himmler in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the Fall of France in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of \"Reichsmarschall\", which gave him seniority over all officers in Germany's armed forces. By 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the Second World War progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities and resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest. After the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Zhang Mengying or Wolfgang Herrndorf?": [

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: \u00c6thelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia) \u00c6thelwald (died 962) was ealdorman of East Anglia. He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of \u00c6thelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when \u00c6thelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of \u00c6lfthryth who married King Edgar after \u00c6thelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta regum anglorum\" has a late account of \u00c6thelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter \u00c6lfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent \u00c6thelwald to see \u00c6lfthryth, ordering him \"to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report. \" When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, \u00c6thelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay \u00c6thelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed \u00c6thelwald. He asked \u00c6lfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed \u00c6thelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the \u00c6thelwald murder story as a \"tissue of romance\" in his \"Historic essays\", but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book \"Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn\". \u00c6thelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother \u00c6thelwine succeeded to his offices. A memorial to \u00c6thelwald, known as the Dead Man's Plack, was erected in Longparish, Hampshire in 1825.\n\nQuestion: Which country \u00c6thelwald, Ealdorman Of East Anglia's wife is from?": [

Her mother took her to the Institution for Deaf and Dumb and Blind in 1904, but she was thought to be too young, and was sent home after a few months. She returned to the school in 1908, aged 7, to begin her education as the school's first deafblind student. In a story that echoes that of Helen Keller, Betteridge's teacher Roberta Reid fingerspelled words into her pupil's hand, until Betteridge made the connection between the words spelled and the objects she was touching. The breakthrough came when Reid spelled the word\" shoe\" while placing a shoe in Alice's hand. Her education then progressed rapidly, and in a few short months she knew 200 nouns and several verbs, including\" run, jump,\" and\" laugh,\" and soon began learning to read braille. In 1920 when she graduated, she was dux of the school. After graduating she remained at the school as a teacher for 9 years, before leaving Darlinghurst and returning to the family farm in Denman. In 1939, Betteridge married Will Chapman( also deafblind), with whom she had been corresponding by mail for some time, and moved to live with him in Melbourne. They were married for nine years before he died of a heart attack in 1948. Betteridge returned to Sydney, and was well regarded for her intelligence, good nature and her independence, even travelling overseas. She died from cancer aged 65.

Reinald IV became the second Duke of Guelders and J\u00fclich upon his brother William's death in 1402 without heirs. Reinald, in conjunction with the Wittelsbach Counts of Holland, Hainaut and Zeeland, tried in vain to slow the emergence of Burgundy in the Netherlands area and in 1406 was unable to enforce old claims against Burgundy to Brabant-Limburg. He allied himself with Rupert, King of Germany, supporting his coronation in Aachen and remained closely connected with the House of Orl\u00e9ans. In 1407, Reinald supported his brother-in-law, John of Arkel, against the Dutch and in 1409 received the city of Gorinchem from John. This started a new feud with Holland which ended in 1412 when Reinald ceded Gorinchem for a large sum of money. He also conceded the city of Emmerich as a result of an earlier promise to the Duke of Cleves. Reinald led the traditional feuds of his House, particularly those against the Bishops of Utrecht and against Holland and Friesland. He occupied Arkel, but in 1422 he was forced to seek peace and return all of his conquests. Reinald also stood against the House of Cleves in the Niederrhein area and maintained a lot of influence over Guelders.

It is a direct continuation of\" Paris By Night 22: 40 N\u0103m \u00c2m Nh\u1ea1c Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\" and\" Paris By Night 28: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 2- D\u00f2ng Nh\u1ea1c N\u1ed1i Ti\u1ebfp\", that was released several years earlier. This program was codenamed,\" In Houston 2\"( which was thought to be a successor to\" Paris By Night 36: In Houston\", before the title was announced). Before the main subject title was announced, the program was then codenamed to\" In Houston 2: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 3\"( the third Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series). The\" three\" was scrapped off the title and the subject was simply,\" Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\". Vietnamese composer, Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, is one of the Vietnamese community's most famous composers today; composing famous songs before and even after the Vietnam War, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Since the early years of\" Paris By Night\", Th\u00fay Nga has been making single- composer videos dedicated to just a single composer. Starting in Paris By Night 64: \u00d0\u00eam V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Th\u00ednh Ph\u00f2ng however, Thuy Nga introduced the three- composer format. That trend continued in\" Paris By Night 66: Ng\u01b0\u1eddi T\u00ecnh v\u00e0 Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ngParis By Night 70: Thu CaParis By Night 74: Hoa B\u01b0\u1edbm Ng\u00e0y X\u01b0a Paris By Night 78: \u00d0\u01b0\u1eddng X\u01b0a\", and finally in\" Paris By Night 83: Nh\u1eefng Kh\u00fac H\u00e1t \u00c2n T\u00ecnh\". However, composer Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is an exception. After being beloved by many, and his songs are in a timeless label, Th\u00fay Nga thought that he should deserve the entire program just dedicated to him and his songs, in a program that was meant for three composers. \" Paris By Night 88\" is Th\u00fay Nga's third live- performance show, after\" Paris By Night 86\" and\" Paris By Night 87\", which was the PBN Talent Show. This is a trend that Th\u00fay Nga may be beginning to adapt, after years of having singers lip- sync on stage, a practice that is common and accepted in the Vietnamese music community. \" Paris By Night 88\" used famous songs that was originally performed in\" Paris By Night 28\" and\" Paris By Night 22\", which were part of the Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series. This is also director Alan Carter's first direction of\" Paris By Night\", in place of its regular director, Michael Watt after many years.

She considered herself primarily a writer, and was the first woman in Poland to support herself from writing and teaching, as well as one of Poland's first writers of children's literature. She made her debut in 1819 with a moralizing treatise \"A Souvenir After a Good Mother\". In 1820s, she edited a popular magazine for children and published several children books, that have won a wide audience over several generations. She published a number of novels, including \"The Letters of El\u017cbieta Rzeczycka to her friend Urszula\" (1824) and \"The Diary of Countess Francoise Krasinska\" (1825), the latter being Hoffmanowa's best known work, translated into several languages, and described as one of the first Polish psychological novels. Hoffmanowa raised the postulate of economic self-empowerment of women. She believed that the first step for women to achieve independence should be getting an education and preparing for paid work. However, she held conservative views on the role of women, and referred to national and Catholic values. In 1826, her candidacy for membership in the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning was submitted, but she was not accepted as a woman. She remained unmarried until the age of thirty, long by the standards of her time for a woman, and only in 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman. Until then she used her maiden name. Though writing was her main and most preferred activity, she also worked as a teacher, at the time called the \"inspector\" and \"visitator\" of female schools, and lecturer in moral science at the Governess' Institute in Warsaw (1826\u20131831). She educated a number of young women, some of whom in later years became writers and teachers themselves. Hoffmanowa was mentioned with respect and appreciation by some of her students. In turn, her pupil Narcyza \u017bmichowska criticized Hoffmanowa's conservatism. During the Poland's November Uprising against the Russian Empire, Hoffmanowa was a co-creator and chairman of the Union of Patriotic Charity of the Varsovians and carried the help to the wounded soldiers. After the fall of the uprising in 1831, she and her husband fled to Paris, where their house became the meeting place of the Polish political refugees. In Paris, Hoffmanowa was active in the Charity Association of Polish Ladies and the Literary Society, and was called \"the Mother of the Great Emigration\u201d. She was friends with Chopin and Mickiewicz. She died of breast cancer at the age of 46 and was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nQuestion: Was Ralf Wohlleben or Ilya Tyapkin born first?": [

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Renegades (band)) Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side- project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four- track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the\" Renegades\" album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced\" Tangerine\" as\" A cover of a song from a band we know\". The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the' Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side- project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album\" Renegades\". The side- project was as a result used as a method to promote the\" Renegades\" album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four- day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title- track for the EP,\" Renegades\" was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The\" Renegades EP\" was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed- up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year. The track\" Renegades\" was re-released, but this time as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download only.\n\nQuestion: Are both bands, The Renegades (Band) and Second Hand (Band), from the same country?": [

He graduated from the Soviet VGIK film school in 1975 after which he started working at the Riga Film Studio. He became a director in 1979. Podnieks' first film \"Cradle\" won an award at the Dok Leipzig festival. In 1981, his film \"The Brothers Kokar\" took the first prize at the Kiev Youth Festival. In the same year, his film \"Constellation of Riflemen\" won honours in the 17th All State Festival in Leningrad and the Latvian Komsomol prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the Soviet Union. Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie \" 'Is It Easy to Be Young?\". The film with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks talked to youngsters later convicted for criminal actions. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled \"Hello, do you hear us?\". It showed civil unrest in Uzbekistan, survivors of the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, striking workers in Yaroslavl and former residents returning to Chernobyl. The first film in the series, \"Red Hot\", was awarded the Prix Italia and the Peabody Award. Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of national identity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. His \"Homeland\" was an account of folk festivals in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the attempted coup by Soviet forces in Riga. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend Andris Slapi\u0146\u0161 was killed and Gvido Zvaigzne, another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries. This was captured on video and shown as an addition to \"Homeland\" and later as an introduction for the revised version of this film.

Van Huysum was baptized 25 February 1688 in Amsterdam. Both his father Justus van Huysum (1659\u20131716), and his brother Jan van Huysum (1682\u20131749), were celebrated flower painters. His manner of painting was very like that of his brother. His approach to botanical illustration, while preserving botanical accuracy, captured a more painterly aspect of his subject. This contrasts with the meticulously exact mode of Georg Dionysius Ehret, his contemporary colleague. Jacob arrived in England in about 1721, and for a while lived in the house of his patron, Mr. Lockyear of South Sea House. Later he enjoyed the patronage of Sir Robert Walpole, who befriended him, and commissioned him to paint decorative works for his house at Houghton in Norfolk. More importantly he produced most of the 50 illustrations for John Martyn's \"Historia Plantarum Rariorum\" (London: 1728-38), and all the drawings for \"Catalogus Plantarum\", an index of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers (London: 1730). His pupil was Louis Fabritius Dubourg. \"Historia Plantarum Rariorum\" depicted plants from the Chelsea Physic Garden and the Cambridge Botanic Garden. These plants had come from the Cape of Good Hope, North America, the West Indies, and Mexico. Elisha Kirkall produced the mezzotint engravings. Each plate was dedicated to a patron and showed an engraved coat-of-arms or monogram. Besides van Huysum, other artists were William Houstoun, Massey, G. Sartorys, and R. Sartorius. The work was published in five parts of ten plates each between 1728 and 1737, and was sold by subscription.

Lee garnered success with\" Pushing Hands\"( 1991),\" The Wedding Banquet\"( 1993), and\" Eat Drink Man Woman\"( 1994), which explored the relationships and conflicts between tradition and modernity, Eastern and Western; the three films are informally known as the Father Knows Best trilogy.

It is the third installment in the\" Fast& Furious\" franchise and stars Lucas Black, Sung Kang, Bow Wow, and Brian Tee. \" The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" follows high school car enthusiast Sean Boswell( Black), who is sent to live in Tokyo with his father, and finds solace in the city's drifting community. Unable to secure the returns of any of the series' initial cast members, plans were made by developers to reconsider\" Tokyo Drift\" and make it a distinct entry in the franchise, which was achieved by focusing on a car subgenre, incorporating a location outside the United States, and establishing new characters. Subsequently, the chronological timeline of the franchise shifted, with all future installments( until 2015's\" Furious 7\") being set between\" 2 Fast 2 Furious\"( 2003) and\" Tokyo Drift\". The film also marks the first to begin the franchise's longtime association with director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, with Lin going onto direct the following three sequels( and is attached to direct two additional future films), while Morgan wrote the next five installments. Casting began in April 2005, and principal photography began in Los Angeles in August 2005, with the majority of the film being shot in Tokyo. \" The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" was released in the United States on June 16, 2006. The film achieved some financial success, eventually grossing over$ 158 million worldwide. However, it is the lowest- grossing film in the franchise. It received generally mixed to negative reviews, with some critics disliking some elements of the plot, action sequences, and acting. However, some praised Lin's direction and parts of the story.

He was the son of Achille-Victor, Duc de Broglie, and his wife, Albertine, baroness Sta\u00ebl von Holstein, a Protestant and the daughter of Madame de Sta\u00ebl. After the death of his mother, who died young, he was brought up by the Baroness Auguste de Sta\u00ebl, n\u00e9e Vernet. This aunt, although also a Protestant, exerted herself \"to make a large-minded Christian of him in the Church to which she did not belong\" (Monseigneur d'Hulst in \"Le Correspondant\", 25 May 1895). Broglie studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, leaving in 1855. Still young, he entered the navy; he was appointed ensign in 1857 and soon after lieutenant. After a voyage to New Caledonia in which he came in contact with active missions, he felt himself called to the religious life. He entered the Seminary of Saint Sulpice in Paris in 1867. After completing his studies there he was ordained priest on 18 October 1870. He was named professor of apologetics at the Institut Catholique in 1879. His teaching, which included philosophical, theological, biblical and historical themes, were intended to defend the Catholic faith from perceived attacks from Positivism and Rationalism. He maintained the harmony and autonomy of the two spheres of knowledge, religion and reason. In his numerous publications the Abb\u00e9 de Broglie was always a faithful defender of Catholic dogma. At the time of his death, which resulted from the violence of an insane person he had taken under his protection, he was preparing a book on the agreement of reason and faith. His most important work is \"Probl\u00e8mes et conclusions de l'histoire des religions\" (Paris, 1886).

At his brother's death he became the heir apparent to the throne and the Dauphin of France, a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"King of France\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then a republic, and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby there is always a monarch; on the death of one monarch, the heir apparent or failing that the heir presumptive are immediately monarch.

The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama.

It stars James Duval, Rose McGowan, and Johnathon Schaech. The film follows two troubled teenage lovers, Amy Blue (McGowan) and Jordan White (Duval), who pick up a young handsome drifter named Xavier Red (Schaech). After he accidentally kills a store clerk, the trio embarks on a journey full of sex, violence, and people from Amy's past. Billed as \"A Heterosexual Movie by Gregg ArakiThe Doom Generation\" is the second film in the director's trilogy known as the \"Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy\", the first being \"Totally Fucked Up\" (1993) and the last one \"Nowhere\" (1997). The characters of Amy Blue and Jordan White are based on the Mark Beyer comic strip \"Amy and Jordan\". \"The Doom Generation\" was Araki's major film debut. It was shot mostly at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of $800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of urban sprawl to give the film an apocalyptic feel. The reasonable budget allowed Araki to hire professional crew, making it the first of his films not shot by himself. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 1995, before appearing at various other film festivals. It received mixed reviews from critics. During the press screening, many of the critics walked out. However, at the San Francisco International Film Festival (SFIFF), the film received critical acclaim, most proclaiming it as Araki's breakthrough film. Distributed by Trimark Pictures, it was released in the United States on October 27, 1995. Despite the favorable reviews, the film did not achieve financial success, earning only $284,785 at the box office.

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini.

The film was made after the immense reception of LINE's promotional short film that featuring\" AADC\" s cast, which got many people to ask Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza to create a feature- length sequel for the beloved teen romance. As a result, the film was officially developed. The film ignores all the events in\" AADC? 2014\", such as Cinta and Rangga both having different jobs than in the short, and despite actress reprising her role in the short, she could n't appear in the feature sequel and her character was written out as having died in this film. Highly anticipated, the film was released on 28 April 2016 simultaneously in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam. The film was released to critical and commercial success.

He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, \u00c6thelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. \u00c6thelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; \u00c6thelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. \u00c6thelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 \u00c6thelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. \u00c6thelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was \u00c6thelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that \u00c6thelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.\n\nQuestion: Who is the stepchild of \u00c6thelred Of Mercia?": [

One of the most popular and highest-paid Hindi film actresses in the 2000s, she has received several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards. Her roles have been cited in the media as a significant departure from previous screen portrayals of Indian women. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. However, while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film \"Biyer Phool\" (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama \"Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat\" on the insistence of her mother. She then began a full-time career in films and the 1998 action drama \"Ghulam\" was her first commercial success. She gained wider recognition for a supporting role in the romance \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998). The year 2002 marked a turning point for Mukerji when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the drama \"Saathiya\". By 2004, Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy \"Hum Tum\" and the dramas \"Yuva\" and \"Veer-Zaara\". She achieved further success for portraying a deaf, blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama \"Black\" (2005), a con woman in \"Bunty Aur Babli\" (2005) and an unhappily married woman in \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" (2006).

She followed it by starring in the successful thrillers  (2012) and \"Mardaani\" (2014), and the comedy-drama \"Hichki\" (2018). The latter emerged as her highest-grossing release. In addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children.
