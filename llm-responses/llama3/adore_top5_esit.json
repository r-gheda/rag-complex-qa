Highly popular for most of the 1950s, Ray has been cited by critics as a major precursor to what would become rock and roll, for his jazz and blues-influenced music and his animated stage personality. Tony Bennett called Ray the \"father of rock and roll,\" and historians have noted him as a pioneering figure in the development of the genre. Raised in The Dalles, Oregon, Ray, who was partially deaf, began singing professionally at age fifteen on Portland radio stations. He would later gain a local following singing at small, predominantly African-American nightclubs in Detroit, where he was discovered in 1951 and subsequently signed to Columbia Records. He rose quickly from obscurity in the United States with the release of his debut album, \"Johnnie Ray\" (1952), as well as with a 78 rpm single, both of whose sides reached the \"Billboard\" magazine's Top Hot 100 songs of 1952: \"Cry\" and \"The Little White Cloud That Cried\". In 1954, Ray made his first and only major motion picture, \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", in which he, Ethel Merman, Marilyn Monroe and others were part of an ensemble cast. His career in his native United States began to decline in 1957, and his American record label dropped him in 1960. He never regained a strong following there and rarely appeared on American television after 1973. His fanbases in the United Kingdom and Australia, however, remained strong until his death in 1990 of complications from liver failure. \"British Hit Singles & Albums\" noted that Ray was \"a sensation in the 1950s, the heart-wrenching vocal delivery of 'Cry' ... influenced many acts including Elvis and was the prime target for teen hysteria in the pre-Presley days. \" Ray's dramatic stage performances and melancholic songs have been credited by music historians as precursory to later performers, ranging from Leonard Cohen to Morrissey.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Ronnie Rocket born?": [

He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95 BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half- brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE( 89/88 BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians.

He was the son and successor of King Mithridates III of Commagene and Iotapa, and of mixed Armenian, Greek and Median descent--the last through his mother. His parents were first cousins. When Antiochus died in 17 AD, his death created major issues for the kingdom, which was in political turmoil at the time. The reasons for this situation are unclear, but it may have been the consequence of his children, Antiochus and Iotapa, being too young to succeed their father. This may have meant that there was no effective authority to prevent civil unrest and unite the citizens of Commagene. Very little is known on his life and his reign as King. After Antiochus' death, two factions appeared: one led by noblemen who wanted Commagene to be placed under the rule of the Roman Empire and the other led by citizens who wanted Commagene's independence to be retained under the rule of their own king. Both factions sent embassies to Rome, seeking the advice and assistance of Emperor Tiberius to decide the future of Commagene. Tiberius decided to make Commagene a part of the Roman province of Syria. That decision was welcomed by many of the citizens by Commagene, which remained under Roman rule until Caligula restored the kingdom to Antiochus\u2019 children in 38 AD. Antiochus III and his son are honoured on the Philopappos Monument in Athens, Greece, dedicated to his great-grandson, Prince Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos, who was a prominent and respected citizen in Athens.

Grand Duke Kirill followed a career in the Russian navy serving during twenty years in the Naval Guards. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War, barely surviving the sinking of the battleship at Port Arthur in April 1904. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They wed in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II prohibition. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honors, also initially banishing the couple from Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas II recognized their marriage. During World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards swearing allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government. During the rule of the provisional governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac. With the murder of his cousins Tsar Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today.

He died of typhoid, pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term (the shortest tenure), becoming the first president to die in office. His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency, because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office. Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office, setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term. Harrison was born in Charles City County, Virginia, the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United States. He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775. During his early military career, he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers, an American military victory that effectively ended the Northwest Indian War. Later, he led a military force against Tecumseh's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, where he earned the nickname \"Old Tippecanoe\". He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812, and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada. Harrison began his political career in 1798, when he was appointed Secretary of the Northwest Territory, and in 1799 he was elected as the territory's delegate in the House of Representatives. Two years later, President John Adams named him governor of the newly established Indiana Territory, a post he held until 1812. After the War of 1812, he moved to Ohio where he was elected to represent the state's in the House in 1816. In 1824, the state legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate; his term was truncated by his appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia in May 1828. Afterward, he returned to private life in North Bend, Ohio until he was nominated as the Whig Party candidate for president in the 1836 election; he was defeated by Democratic vice president Martin Van Buren. Four years later, the party nominated him again with John Tyler as his running mate, and the Whig campaign slogan was \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\". They defeated Van Buren in the 1840 election, making Harrison the first Whig to win the presidency. At of age at the time of his inauguration, Harrison was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency, a distinction he held until 1981, when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated at age . Due to his brief tenure, scholars and historians often forgo listing him in historical presidential rankings. However, historian William W. Freehling calls him \"the most dominant figure in the evolution of the Northwest territories into the Upper Midwest today\".\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Fleetwood Sheppard or George William Whitaker?": [

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed\" The Wages of Fear\" and\" Les Diaboliques\", which are critically recognized as among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including\" The Mystery of Picasso\", which was declared a national treasure by the government of France. Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French- language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German- owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film\" Le Corbeau\" drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including\" Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\".

The film features Sivaji Ganesan, Savitri, and K. B. Sundarambal in the lead roles, with T. S. Balaiah, R. Muthuraman, Nagesh, T. R. Mahalingam, K. Sarangkapani, Devika, Manorama, and Nagarajan in supporting roles. K. V. Mahadevan composed the film's soundtrack and score, and Kannadasan and Sankaradas Swamigal wrote the song lyrics. Co-produced by A. M. Shahul Hameed, it was inspired by the \"Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam\": a collection of sixty-four Shaivite devotional, epic stories, written in the 16th century by Paranjothi Munivar, which record the actions (and antics) of Shiva on Earth in a number of disguises to test his devotees. \"Thiruvilaiyadal\" depicts four of the stories. The first is about the poets Dharumi and Nakkeerar; the second concerns Dhatchayini. The third recounts how Shiva's future wife, Parvati, is born as a fisherwoman; Shiva, in the guise of a fisherman, finds and marries her. The fourth story is about the singers Banabhathirar and Hemanatha Bhagavathar. The soundtrack was praised, and the songs \"Pazham NeeyappaOru Naal PodhumaIsai Thamizh\" and \"Paattum Naane\" became popular with the Tamil diaspora. \"Thiruvilaiyadal\" was released on 31 July 1965 to critical praise for its screenplay, dialogue, direction, music and the performances of Ganesan, Nagesh and Balaiah. The film was a commercial success, running for over twenty-five weeks in several theatres and becoming a silver jubilee film. It was also responsible for a resurgence in mythological cinema, since it was released when Tamil cinema was primarily producing social films. \"Thiruvilaiyadal\" received the Certificate of Merit for the Second-Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 13th National Film Awards and the Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Tamil. A digitally-restored version was released in September 2012, and was also a commercial success.\n\nQuestion: Which film came out earlier, Aanaval Mothiram or Heroes Of The Street?": [

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\nDocument[2](Title: Arcadi Gaydamak) Arcadi Aleksandrovich Gaydamak (born 8 April 1952 in Moscow, USSR) is a Russian-born French-Israeli businessman, philanthropist, and President of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities and Organizations of Russia (KEROOR).

In the AngolaGate scandal, he was convicted of failure to declare income. On November 24, 2015, he started serving a prison sentence at Fresnes prison in France for that tax issue. In the early 21st century, Gaydamak returned to Israel, where he founded Social Justice, a movement that became a political party. He ran for mayor of Jerusalem but did not win. He bought Hapoel Jerusalem, a professional basketball club. He also bought two newspapers, one in France and one in Russia.

The infant Gustav was present at his mother's wedding to the King of Sweden in 1568 and at her coronation, together with his sister Sigrid. The presence of the children was a way to demonstrate their new status: both of them were officially confirmed as legitimate, and Gustav and his sister were given all the privileges of a royal prince and princess. After his father's dethronement, Gustav was sent to live outside of Sweden in 1575, to protect him from King John III who feared that the supporters of Eric would try to deprive his son of the crown. Gustav came to Poland where he lived in poverty and despair. At some time during his stay he became a Catholic. Ivan IV of Russia attempted to persuade Gustav to help him in his political ambitions around the Baltic, but these attempts (which included both promises and several years exile) failed. In August 1599 Gustav arrived in Moscow for a proposed marriage to the Tsar Boris Godunov's daughter Ksenia. But there, he lived a self-indulgent life. As a consequence, he invited his old lover Brita and their children to stay in his Russian home, and showing them in public in a carriage harnessed as though it was meant for the tsarina. As a result, the Tsar eventually broke off the engagement of his beloved daughter. As compensation, the homeless Gustav received the principality of Uglich, where he lived until the beginning of the reign of the False Dmitry, who ordered his arrest by the demands of his ally \u2014 Sigismund III Vasa (cousin of Gustav and son of King John III) and sent him to Yaroslavl jail.

This mesh of krautrock, shoegaze, drone, space- rock, and experimental electronica helped the band forge a unique sound, which helped them stand apart from other active bands in the Seattle scene that were more grunge, metal, or indie- rock based. Their success in solidifying a unique sound however did not translate to album sales, and the band remained a relatively obscure act, with a small cult following.

His mother was a daughter of Fujiwara no Tokihira. His elder brother from the same mother Atsutoshi died before their father's death. In 977 he became Sadaijin, and when his cousin, the regent Fujiwara no Kanemichi was in a critical medical condition, he ceded the position of Kampaku (regent) to Yoritada, instead of his rival brother Kaneie. Although Yoritada's two daughters were consorts of Emperor En'y\u016b and Emperor Kazan, they did not have any sons. Yoritada thus had only a tenable blood relationship with the Emperors. His cousin Kaneie was the grandfather of Crown Prince Yasuhito (Emperor Ichij\u014d), and he encouraged Emperor Kazan to abdicate a throne. By the accession of Emperor Ichij\u014d, Yoritada retired from his post as Kampaku, and Kaneie became Sessho (regent) for his grandson Emperor Ichij\u014d.

At the age of 12, Diego was married to Juana de Luna, also 12 and granddaughter of \u00c1lvaro de Luna, as part of a plan by his family to get a hold of the inheritance of \u00c1lvaro de Luna. Juana Pimentel, grandmother of Juana de Luna, had tried to prevent the marriage, but had failed because of the intervention of King Henry IV of Castile. In the War of the Castilian Succession, Diego and his father supported Juana la Beltraneja, who lost the battle for the throne. Diego, who had become 2nd Duke of Escalona after the death of his father in October 1474, was pardoned by Isabella I of Castile and allowed to keep his properties. But he wasn't chosen as successor for his father as Grand Master of the Order of Santiago. His wife Juana de Luna died in 1480. Diego remarried in 1484 with Juana Enr\u00edquez y Velasco, sister of Fadrique Enr\u00edquez, Admiral of Castile. Diego L\u00f3pez Pacheco fought as general against the Moors, and was present in the final Siege of Granada in 1492, which ended the Moorish presence in Spain. In 1504, after the death of Isabel, Pacheco supported her eldest surviving daughter, Queen Juana, and her king consort Felipe, over King Ferdinand of Aragon's faction. In 1519, he was made a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece.\nDocument[2](Title: Tekle Giyorgis II) Tekle Giyorgis II (Ge'ez: \u1270\u12ad\u1208 \u130a\u12ee\u122d\u130a\u1235, \"Plant of Saint George\" born Wagshum Gobeze \u12cb\u130d\u1239\u121d \u130e\u1260\u12dc lit. Elect (King) of Wag, \"my courageous one\"; died 1873) was n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st (Emperor) of Ethiopia from 1868 to 1871. Emperor Tekle Giorgis II based his claim to the Imperial throne on a dual heritage: his mother, Princess Ayichesh Tedla, was a descendant of Emperor Iyasu I also known as Atse Adyam Seged or Iyasu the Great, who was the grandson of Emperor Fasilides of the Gondar branch of the Solomonic dynasty; and via his father Wagshum Gebre Medhin, he was the heir to the old Zagwe dynasty and the rulers of Lasta and Wag. Tekle Giyorgis II's mother, Princess Ayichesh Tedla, was the daughter of the popular Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, of the Gondarine Solomonic line, heir of Lasta, and one of twelve Amhara nobles who were executed during Tewodros II's rule. Dejazmach Tedla's death had caused a rebellion in Wollo. Emperor Iyasu I's great-granddaughter, Princess Yeworqweha, had been married to Ras Wand Bewossen Yonas, a renowned 18th-century warlord and ruling Zemene Mesafint prince who governed Lasta and Begemeder until he died in battle in 1777. Their son and heir, Prince Ras Hailu Wand Bewossen, the successor of his father Wand Bewossen, and sovereign of Lasta, of the Gondar Solomonic bloodline, begot Princess Ayichesh's father, Dejazmach Tedla Hailu. Princess Aychesh was also the paternal grandmother of Leul Ras Kassa Haile Darge. Leul Ras Kassa's father, Dejazmach Hailu, was her younger son and the half brother of Tekle Giyorgis II, to whom she had given birth from a remarriage with an influential Lasta Ecclesiastic and nobleman, Dejazmach Woldekiros, after the death of her husband, Wagshum Gebremedhin. Tekle Giyorgis II's uncles, the sons of Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, played significant roles as members of the Gondar-Lasta Imperial House, brothers of his mother, Princess Aychesh. They interceded as high Imperial officials during his rise to the throne and throughout his reign. Prince Ras Meshesha Tedla is known to have ruled Wag province, and Dejazmach Serawit Tedla, Dejazmach Yimam Tedla, Dejazmach Yesufe Tedla, Dejazmach Yimer Tedla were notable Princes of the Gondar-Lasta Solomonic bloodline of Emperors Fasilides, Yohannes I, and Iyasu I. Dejazmach Yimer Tedla fathered Princess Menen Yimer, a first cousin, considered a sister, of Emperor Tekel Giyorgis II and the maternal ancestress of Lij Tedla Melaku, an author, royalist, and public figure. Emperor Tekle Giorgis II's principal rivals for sole rule were Menelik II (who was at the time king of Shewa), and Dejazmach Kassai (the future Emperor Yohannes IV). Tekle Giyorgis II married the sister of the latter, Dinqinesh Mercha. Despite that Tekle Giyorgis ruled Ethiopia for over three years, some lists of the Emperors of Ethiopia omit his name. In Ethiopia today, little is known of him, in contrast to his celebrated predecessor and successor, Yohannes IV.\nDocument[3](Title: Josephus) Titus Flavius Josephus (37 \u2013 100), born Yosef ben Matityahu (\"Yosef ben Matityahu\"), was a first-century Romano-Jewish historian who was born in Jerusalem\u2014then part of Roman Judea\u2014to a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry. He initially fought against the Romans during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War as head of Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in 67 CE to Roman forces led by Vespasian after the six-week siege of Jotapata. Josephus claimed the Jewish Messianic prophecies that initiated the First Roman-Jewish War made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. In response Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius. Flavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator when Titus led the Siege of Jerusalem. Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the city's destruction and the looting and destruction of Herod's Temple (Second Temple) soon followed. Josephus recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish\u2013Roman War (66\u201370 CE), including the Siege of Masada. His most important works were \"The Jewish War\" (75) and \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (94). \" The Jewish War\" recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. \" Antiquities of the Jews\" recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity, although not specifically mentioned by Josephus. Josephus' works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Palestine.\nDocument[4](Title: Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f) Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f or Viktoria Solnceva( born 19 June 1998) is a Ukraine- born Turkish( since 2014) swimmer.\nDocument[5](Title: Giovanni Kminek-Szedlo) Giovanni Kminek- Szedlo, n\u00e9e Jan Km\u00ednek- Szedlo( April 22, 1828 \u2013 November 24, 1896) was a Czech \u2013 Italian Egyptologist .<br> He is usually remembered as the first Egyptologist from what nowadays is the Czech Republic but since he spent most of his life and fulfilled his whole career in Italy, he is usually not seen as the founder of Czech Egyptology, a figure rather identified in the later Franti\u0161ek Lexa.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Joseph J.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: List of The Dillinger Escape Plan band members) The Dillinger Escape Plan is an American mathcore band from Morris Plains, New Jersey. Formed in 1997, the group originally featured vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, lead guitarist Ben Weinman, rhythm guitarist Derek Brantley, bassist Adam Doll and drummer Chris Pennie, although Brantley left after only two shows. The remaining four members recorded the band's self-titled debut EP in 1997, before John Fulton replaced Brantley for the subsequent tour and 1998's \"Under the Running Board\". Shortly after the second EP's release, Fulton left the band due to \"creative differences\", and in early 1999 Doll was forced to cease involvement due to a spinal injury suffered in a road traffic accident. As a result, Weinman performed all guitars and bass on the band's full-length debut album \"Calculating Infinity\", released in 1999. Following the release of \"Calculating Infinity\", Brian Benoit replaced Fulton and Jeff Wood took Doll's place; Wood left the band in 2000 due to the ongoing effects of a gunshot wound to the head sustained in 1992, and was replaced by Liam Wilson. In April 2001, it was announced that Minakakis had decided to leave The Dillinger Escape Plan to pursue \"non-music related endeavors\", with the band briefly placed on hiatus. The vocalist was replaced later in the year by Greg Puciato, who was chosen from \"over one hundred\" singers who auditioned by submitting a recording of \"43% Burnt\" to the band. In between the departure of Minakakis and the addition of Puciato, the band recorded the EP \"Irony Is a Dead Scene\" with Faith No More and Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, which was released in 2002. In 2004, the band released its first album with Puciato on vocals, \"Miss Machine\". Later in the year, Benoit suffered nerve damage in his left hand which affected his ability to play guitar; after attempting to continue, he was forced to leave the band in April 2005 and was replaced by James Love. During a tour in 2006, tensions arose between Weinman and Pennie, with the guitarist briefly leaving the band citing \"undisclosed personal reasons\". Pennie eventually left the band in 2007 to join Coheed and Cambria, with Gil Sharone replacing him for the band's third album \"Ire Works\". Also in 2007, guitarist Jeff Tuttle was added to the band due to Love's unavailability. By the beginning of 2009, Sharone had left the band and been replaced by Billy Rymer. \" Option Paralysis\" was released in 2010, which marked Tuttle's first contribution to the band (he performed additional vocals, with Weinman recording all guitars). The guitarist later left the band in August 2012 to attend film school. Love rejoined the band as Tuttle's replacement, although was not featured on the 2013 album \" One of Us Is the Killer\". After a brief hiatus, Love was replaced by Kevin Antreassian in 2015. The band released \"Dissociation\" in 2016, which was presented as the group's final album before embarking on an indefinite hiatus the following year. In the liner notes of \"Dissociation\" the band listed everyone who was a member or a part of the band in some other way or another. The list states \" The Dillinger Escape Plan is: Billy Rymer, Greg Puciato, Liam Wilson, Benjamin Weinman, Kevin Antreassian, Dimitri Minakakis, Adam Doll, Brian Benoit, Chris Pennie, Tom Apostolopoulos, Jeff Wood, John Fulton, Jeff Tuttle, Mike Patton, Thomas Bouaziz, Kevin Hilliard, Gil Sharone, James Love, Jessica Curreri, Steve Evetts, Talmadge Cook, Ryan Downey, Jeff Geisser, Brian Montouri, Paul D'Elia, Chris Tropea, Asian Steve, Timothy Connors, Matt Rosenblum, Reid Ferris, Marc Schapiro, And all the other fearless soldiers who have graced the stage with us over the past 20 years.\"\nDocument[2](Title: Ben Weinman) Benjamin A.

He was also the third archbishop of Rouen from 755 to 762. Along with his brothers, he was denied any claim to the legacy of his father. He became archbishop during the reign of his half brother Pepin the Short. Remigius is also known as Saint Remigius. His feast day is January 19.

His life is known in legend and tradition and is shown in the stained glass windows( c. 1521) and south gate of Rouen Cathedral and the stained glass windows of the \u00e9glise Saint- Godard( 1555). The\" Catholic Encyclopedia\" claims that his legend has little historical value with little authentic information. He was both Lord Chancellor of France and R\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire of France.

He was the younger son of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, and his second wife, Papia of Envermeu. Mauger was brought up at the abbey of F\u00e9camp as an eminent member of the ducal family, some of whom were later openly hostile to the accession of Duke William II. On the death of his uncle Robert, Archbishop of Rouen in 1037, Mauger, who was only 18 was chosen to succeed him. Mauger was apparently slow to instill loyalty to the young Duke William. In particular, he was opposed to the marriage of Duke William and Matilda of Flanders in 1049. His full brother William of Talou married a sister of the Count of Ponthieu and was appointed by William as Count of Arques, near Dieppe. William of Talou, Mauger's brother, was defeated in a failed rebellion against their nephew Duke William in battle near Arques in 1053, after which the former fled into exile at Boulogne. Because of a perceived connection to his brother's rebellion, Mauger was deposed from his archbishopric at the council of Lisieux. Mauger was banished from Rouen to the Isle of Guernsey; he landed at a bay on the south coast that was named \"Saint's Bay\" in his honour. Mauger's behaviour as a secular lord who had opposed papal authority enabled William to achieve his deposition on the grounds of inappropriate conduct at a provincial council held at Lisieux in 1054 or 1055. Stories relating to the end of Mauger's life in the Channel Islands were collected a century later by Wace (1100-1174), himself a native of Jersey. According to Wace, Mauger had a common law wife, who had borne him many children, and Mauger had devoted himself to hawking and reading occult sciences. The dethroned bishop is alleged to have abandoned himself to a pact with the devil and, having gone mad, drowned about 1055; his body was buried in a church at Cherbourg-Octeville.

The lake covers a total of 199 acres( 80 hectare) and reaches a maximum depth of 15 feet( 4.6 m). The littoral zone is 129 acres( 52 hectare). Due to its shallow depth and subsequent abundant plant and algae growth, water clarity extends 6 feet( 1.8 m). The lake hosts small populations of northern pike and walleye and large communities of panfish. Access to Lake Windigo is by a short portage from Cass Lake on the north side of the island. The lake is best navigated by canoe, rowboat, or other small watercraft. Windigo is located in Star Island in Cass Lake. In the television series\" Ripley's Believe It Or Not\", the lake was designated as being the only lake within a lake in the Northern Hemisphere. There are a few other such lakes. It is, however, the only spring fed lake within a river fed lake in the northern hemisphere. Star Island is itself a historical site. The village of Ozaawindib, Schoolcraft's guide to Lake Itasca, was located on the island. The Ojibwe people flourished in the area up until the arrival of American and European settlers. In the early 1900s, parts of the island were sold to private entities, while the majority of the island entered the protection of the federal government as a national forest. It remains this way to this day. The lake derives its name from the Wendigo or Windigo of Ojibwe mythology. A cryptoid was a malevolent, cannibalistic spirit that could possess people and inspire cannibalism, particularly during times of famine. Wendigo ceremonies were often performed during times of famine to remind the people to be wary of the Wendigo spirits.\nDocument[3](Title: Sachigo Lake) Sachigo Lake is a lake in Unorganized Kenora District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.

He was therefore probably a grandson of Hidda and Christian of Thuringia and named for his great uncle Gero the Great. He succeeded his probable uncle, Hodo, as Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark including Mark Lausitz (Lusatia) in 993 upon the death of margrave of Lusatia Hodo or Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark. Gero was created Count of Hassegau in 992, just a year before becoming margrave. He died in his territory in battle with a Polish army of Boleslaw I in Gau Diadesi and was buried in his family's monastery of Nienburg. He was survived by his wife Adelaide (Athelheidhe) and one son, Thietmar, who succeeded him.\nDocument[2](Title: Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark) Odo( or Hodo) I( also\" Huodo\" or\" Huoto\")( c. 930 \u2013 13 March 993) was margrave in the Saxon Eastern March of the Holy Roman Empire from 965 until his death. Odo was, if the onomastics are correct, a son( or maybe a nephew) of Christian( d. 950), a Saxon count in the Nordth\u00fcringgau and Schwabengau of Eastphalia. Count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, had married Hidda( d. 970), a sister of Gero, margrave of the vast\" marca Geronis\" in the lands settled by Polabian Slavs. From 945 he also ruled over the adjacent gau of Serimunt beyond the Saale river. In 965, Margrave Gero died and his great\" marca Geronis\" was divided into five smaller marches. Count Thietmar, a known son of Hidda, and Odo inherited large parts of his march: Odo received the so- called\" marca Orientalis\" or Eastern March, stretching from the Gau Serimunt in the west up to the remotest outposts on the B\u00f3br river in the east, while Thietmar appeared as margrave of southern Meissen after 970. Both are buried at Nienburg Abbey, a foundation of Thietmar and his brother Archbishop Gero of Cologne, which too provides evidence of their probable relationship. As a young man, Margrave Odo had shared the tutorship of Otto's son( later Otto II) with the boy's step- uncle William, Archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop William taught literature and culture; Margrave Odo taught war and legal customs. Odo spent the first years of his rule subduing the Slavic tribes settling in the eastern parts of the Saxon Ostmark. He held comital rights in the gau of Nizizi, comprising the lands between the Mulde, Elbe and Black Elster rivers, and appeared with the title\" marchio\"( margrave) only in 974, though he had held further marcher territories( officially as a county) since 965. In that same year( 974), Odo was made Count in the Saxon Nordth\u00fcringgau, still rivalling with Margrave Thietmar. Odo is chiefly known for his quarrels with the Polish duke Mieszko I. The West Slavic Polans had established a state east of the Saxon marches and, aiming to advance into the Pomeranian lands north of the Warta river, had reached an agreement with late Margrave Gero and Emperor Otto I: Mieszko's ducal title was confirmed and the Polans paid a recurring tribute to the emperor, which was collected by Margrave Odo. The medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, apparently quite gladly, relates that Odo's reputation with Mieszko was such that the duke of Poland\" would not have dared while wearing his fur coat to enter a house where he knew the margrave to be, or to remain seated when the margrave stood up.\" When in 972 the Polans again marched for the Baltic trade centre of Wolin, they entered into open conflict with Odo. The margrave, intending to compel Mieszko to pay tribute for the Pomeranian territory between the Oder and Warta rivers, invaded that region. Aged Emperor Otto, engaged in the marriage of his son Otto II with Princess Theophanu at far- off Rome, ordered them to cease until he himself could arbitrate their dispute. However, Odo attacked Mieszko's forces and was defeated on 24 June at the Battle of Cedynia. The belligerents reconciled at the Imperial Diet in Quedlinburg one year later. In 983, Odo took part in the attempts to suppress the Great Slav Rising of the Polabian Lutici tribes, but was not able to prevent the loss of the Saxon Northern March. He also failed to succeed Thietmar in the Margraviate of Meissen in 979. Odo left a son, Siegfried( d. 1030), who became a monk at Nienburg, but left the monastery on his father's death to claim his inheritance. He did however not prevail against Thietmar's son Gero II, who became Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark in 993. Siegfried again appeared as a count from 1015, when he claimed the Saxon Ostmark from Gero's son Thietmar IV and allied with Duke Mieszko II of Poland in the German- Polish War. Thietmar IV prevailed with the support by Emperor Henry II, but lost the eastern parts of his march to Mieszko II in the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.\nDocument[3](Title: William, Margrave of the Nordmark) William( died 10 September 1056) was the Margrave of the Nordmark from 1051 until his death.

The son of the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George by his first wife, Margaret Owen, Lloyd George was educated at Portmadoc School and Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1910. During the First World War he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers and rose to the rank of Major. He became an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and served in the British Army again during the Second World War. On 7 April 1917 Lloyd George married Roberta McAlpine (1898\u20131966), a daughter of Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet. They had two children, Valerie Davidia (1918\u20132000) and Owen (1924\u20132010), before being divorced in 1933. In 1935 Lloyd George married secondly Winifred Emily Peedle, a daughter of Thomas W. Peedle. Valerie became the wife of the academic and broadcasting executive, Sir Goronwy Daniel. On 1 January 1945 his father was created Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, and he gained the courtesy title of Viscount Gwynedd. Less than three months later, on 26 March 1945, his father died of cancer and he inherited his peerage, unusually becoming the first member of the family to sit in the House of Lords, as David Lloyd George had been too ill to do so.

She was educated at Clapham High School, where in the fifth form she had made friends with Mair, Lloyd George's oldest daughter, and then at Royal Holloway College where she studied Classics. In July 1911, Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, hired Stevenson as a governess for his youngest daughter Megan. Lloyd George and Stevenson were soon attracted to each other. Although Stevenson, who wanted a conventional marriage and many children, hesitated about becoming the mistress of a married man, she agreed to become Lloyd George's personal secretary on his terms, which included a sexual relationship, in 1913. She was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours and accompanied Lloyd George to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The delegates were under the impression she was still just his secretary. Stevenson chose the location and supervised the construction of Lloyd George's house Bron-y-de in Churt, Surrey. She also arranged and collated Lloyd George's extensive archive of personal and political papers so that he could write his \"War Memoirs\". After having had two abortions, Stevenson gave birth to a daughter, Jennifer, in 1929. Stevenson had been having an affair with Thomas Tweed, a novelist and Liberal Party official.

He was a direct descendant of King James I through his paternal grandmother, Lady Agnes Keith, a daughter of William Keith, 3rd Earl Marischal. Douglas studied at St. Andrews University and joined the household of the Earl of Morton. Subsequently, while visiting the French court, he became a Catholic, and was in consequence, upon his return, disinherited and placed under restraint. Nevertheless, Douglas succeeded to his father's titles and estates in 1591, and though in 1592 he was disgraced for his complicity in Lord Bothwell's plot, he was soon liberated and performed useful services as the King's Lieutenant in the north of Scotland. In July 1592, however, he was asking for help from Queen Elizabeth in a plot with Erroll and other lords against Sir John Maitland, the Chancellor, and protesting his absolute rejection of Spanish offers, but in October he signed the Spanish Blanks, and upon the discovery of this treason was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle on his return in January 1593. Douglas succeeded on the 13th in escaping by the help of his Countess, joining the Earls of Huntly and Erroll in the north. They were offered an Act of \"oblivion\" or \"abolition\" provided they renounced their religion or quit Scotland. Declining these conditions they were declared traitors and \"forfeited.\" They remained in rebellion, and in July 1594 an attack made by them on Aberdeen roused James's anger. Huntly and Erroll were subdued by James himself in the north, and Angus failed in an attempt upon Edinburgh in concert with the Earl of Bothwell. Subsequently, in 1597 they all renounced their religion, declared themselves Presbyterians, and were restored to their estates and honours. Angus was again included in the Privy Council, and in June 1598 was appointed the King's Lieutenant in southern Scotland, in which capacity he showed great zeal and conducted the \"Raid of Dumfries,\" as the campaign against the Johnstones was called. Not long afterwards, Angus, offended at the advancement of Huntly to a Marquessate, recanted, resisted all the arguments of the ministers to bring him to a \"better mind,\" and was again excommunicated in 1608. In 1609 Douglas withdrew into exile, and died in Paris, France on 3 March 1611. He is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s.

He was one of the first patroons, but the only one to become successful. He founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York's Capital District. His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s. Eventually, that came to an end during the Anti-Rent War.

To keep from risking his life in the army like his father, he apprenticed under his uncle, a successful Amsterdam jeweler. He too became a successful jeweler and was one of the first subscribers to the Dutch West India Company upon its conception.

Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common.

Hazmi and a longtime friend, Khalid al- Mihdhar, left their homes in Saudi Arabia in 1995 to fight for Muslims in the Bosnian War. Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999. Already long time affiliates of al- Qaeda with extensive fighting experience, Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States. Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999. Hazmi trained in an al- Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999. He traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al- Qaeda Summit. Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles, California, from Bangkok, Thailand, on January 15, 2000, with Khalid al- Mihdhar. The two settled in San Diego, staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000. While in San Diego, they attended its mosque, led by Anwar al- Awlaki. The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego. Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar's poor English skills, they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious. Mihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000, and they both traveled to Phoenix, Arizona. They later moved to Falls Church, Virginia, in April 2001, where the rest of the hijackers began to join them. Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001. The CIA reportedly received Hazmi's name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future. Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain. A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but they were not located until after the attacks. On September 10, 2001, Hazmi, along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. The next morning, Hazmi and four other terrorists, boarded American Airlines Flight 77 at Dulles Airport and hijacked the plane so that Hani Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Hazmi was initially dismissed as a\" muscle hijacker\" following the attacks, but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed. His younger brother, Salem al- Hazmi, was another of the hijackers aboard the same flight.\nDocument[3](Title: Al Jawhara bint Musaed Al Jiluwi) Al Jawhara bint Musaed bin Jiluwi Al Saud( died 1919) was one of King Abdulaziz's spouses.

He was at various times set up to become King of Sardinia, Prince of Achaea or King of Thessalonica, but ultimately ascended no throne.\nDocument[2](Title: Philip II of Spain) Philip II of Spain (21 May 1527 \u2013 13 September 1598) was King of Spain (1556\u201398), King of Portugal (1581\u201398, as Philip I), King of Naples and Sicily (both from 1554), and \"jure uxoris\" King of England and Ireland (during his marriage to Queen Mary I from 1554 to 1558). He was also Duke of Milan, and from 1555, lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. The son of Holy Roman Emperor and King of the Spanish kingdoms Charles V and Isabella of Portugal, Philip was called \"Felipe el PrudentePhilip the Prudent\") in the Spanish kingdoms; his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake the Philippines. During his reign, the Spanish kingdoms reached the height of its influence and power. This is sometimes called the \"Spanish Golden Age\". Philip led a highly debt-leveraged regime, seeing state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596. This policy was partly the cause of the declaration of independence that created the Dutch Republic in 1581. On 31 December 1584 Philip signed the Treaty of Joinville, with Henry I, Duke of Guise signing on behalf of the Catholic League; consequently Philip supplied a considerable annual grant to the League over the following decade to maintain the civil war in France, with the hope of destroying the French Calvinists. A devout Catholic, Philip saw himself as the defender of Catholic Europe against the Ottoman Empire and the Protestant Reformation. He sent a large armada to invade Protestant England in 1588, with the strategic aim of overthrowing Elizabeth I of England and re-establishing Catholicism there. He hoped to stop both English interference in the Spanish Netherlands and the harm caused to Spanish interests by English and Dutch privateering. Philip was described by the Venetian ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as \"slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, somewhat prominent lip, and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive\". The Ambassador went on to say \"He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious.\" Besides Mary I, Philip was married three other times and widowed four times.\nDocument[3](Title: Constance of Sicily, Queen of Cyprus) Constance of Sicily( 1304 /1306 \u2013 after 19 June 1344) was Queen of Cyprus and Jerusalem by marriage to Henry II of Cyprus and Queen of Armenia by marriage to Leo IV of Armenia.\nDocument[4](Title: Peter II of Sicily) Peter II (1304 \u2013 8 August 1342) was the King of Sicily from 1337 until his death, although he was associated with his father as co-ruler from 1321. Peter's father Frederick III of Sicily and his mother was Eleanor, a daughter of Charles II of Naples. His reign was marked by strife between the throne and the nobility, especially the old families of Ventimiglia, Palizzi and Chiaramonte, and by war between Sicily and Naples. Contemporaries regarded Peter as feeble-minded. Giovanni Villani, in his \"Nuova Cronica\", calls him \"almost an imbecile\" (Italianate Latin: \"quasi un mentacatto\") and Nicola Speciale, in his \"Historia Sicula\", calls him \"pure and simplepurus et simplex\"). Under Peter, the Neapolitans conquered the Lipari Islands and took the cities of Milazzo and Termini in Sicily itself.

Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\nDocument[2](Title: Gustav Jensen) Gustav Margerth Jensen( July 13, 1845 \u2013 November 2, 1922) was a Norwegian priest, hymnologist, hymnwriter, seminary instructor, and liturgist.

In 1889 he became the priest at Trinity Church in Oslo, and then in 1895 he returned to his position as head instructor at the Practical Theological Seminary. In 1902 he was appointed diocesan provost at Our Savior's Church in Kristiania( currently the Oslo Cathedral). Jensen stopped serving as diocesan provost in 1911 in order to use all of his time to work on revising\" Landstads kirkesalmebog\"( Landstad's Church Hymnal), for which he had been commissioned by a royal resolution in 1908. In 1915 he delivered his\" Forslag til en revideret Salmebok for den norske kirke\"( Proposals for a Revised Hymnal for the Church of Norway), a draft version that generated much controversy. Jensen died in 1922, before the hymnal was approved and issued. The hymnal was finally approved in 1924 and was known as\" Landstads reviderte salmebok\"( Landstad's Revised Hymnal).\nDocument[3](Title: Solveig Gunbj\u00f8rg Jacobsen) Solveig Gunbj\u00f8rg Jacobsen (8 October 1913 \u2013 25 October 1996) was the first person to be born and raised south of the Antarctic Convergence, in Grytviken, South Georgia.

In 1972, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. From 1979 on, she retreated from public life and shunned all forms of public contact; for this she is often compared to Greta Garbo.

In addition to being known for her film career, she received notoriety for being involved in several scandals throughout her career. Raised in Portland, Oregon, Carmen began acting in Hollywood at age 15, eventually performing with Keystone Studios. She first garnered public attention for her involvement in a statutory rape case involving herself and a 35-year-old automobile dealer in Los Angeles, but the charges against him were ultimately dropped as she could not concretely prove her age. Carmen resumed her career, appearing in several films throughout the 1910s, including a small role in D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), followed by leads in \"American Aristocracy\" (1916) opposite Douglas Fairbanks, and in Frank Lloyd's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1917). She also starred as Cosette in Lloyd's adaptation of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (also 1917). In 1918, she married film director Roland West. Carmen made her final film appearance in West's horror film \"The Bat\" (1926). In December 1935, Carmen garnered significant media coverage following the death of actress Thelma Todd, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the garage of Carmen and West's Pacific Palisades home. Carmen became embroiled in the investigation after she claimed to have seen Todd on Hollywood Boulevard hours after the time police determined Todd had died. A grand jury ultimately ruled Todd's death accidental, with the consensus that she had inadvertently caused her own death by running her car inside the garage to warm herself after West locked her out of the home; Todd and West had been engaged in a romantic affair at the time. Following Todd's death, Carmen and West divorced, and she lived the remainder of her life outside the public eye before dying in an El Cajon nursing home in 1984, aged 86.\nDocument[4](Title: The Crime Doctor's Diary) The Crime Doctor's Diary is a 1949 American mystery film directed by Seymour Friedman and starring Warner Baxter, Stephen Dunne and Lois Maxwell.

The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.

Club says that the song \"seethes with his inimitable flair for epic drama.\" Pitchfork Media says \"it's clear that Buckley was beginning to explore a more discordant and subversive approach\", and Rolling Stone notes the \"explosive garage-rock theater\" in the album generally, referencing the \"barking vocal rage and twisted-metal guitars\" of the song.\nDocument[5](Title: Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne) Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne( Bengali: \u0997\u09c1\u09aa\u09c0 \u0997\u09be\u0987\u09a8 \u09ac\u09be\u0998\u09be \u09ac\u09be\u0987\u09a8\" Gupi Gain Bagha Bain\") is a 1969 Indian fantasy adventure comedy film written and directed by Satyajit Ray and based on a story by his grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. It is a fantasy- musical film, with the music and lyrics written by Ray himself. This is the first film of the\" Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne series\", followed by a couple of sequels-\" Hirak Rajar Deshe\" was released in 1980 and\" Goopy Bagha Phire Elo\", written by Ray but directed by his son Sandip Ray, was released in 1992. The film was based on the characters Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne, who made their first appearance in the\" Sandesh\" magazine in 1915, with illustrations by Ray's grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. In 1961, after the revival of\" Sandesh\", Ray began contemplating the idea of making a film based on that story, and he was partly compelled by his son Sandip to make a film which was less' grim and adult'. This was matched by Ray's own desire to make a movie that, unlike his previous movies, would cater to children. Plus this would also give him an opportunity to lace the story with music and dancing, a point his movies' producers and distributors were always insisting upon. Ray managed to convince producers to finance the movie, even though it was clear from the beginning that the film would cost a lot of money. The movie released to great critical and commercial reception, which held the record for longest continuous run of a Bengali- language movie in Bengal, as it ran for 51 straight weeks. It won the Best Feature Film and Best Direction awards at the 16th National Film Awards, and went on to win many other international awards as well. Critical reception was highly positive. Raja Sen called it to be the most innovative movie to have ever come out of India. Phil Hall said that the movie\" comes as a delightful surprise \u2013 Ray, it appears, not only possessed a great sense of humor but also enjoyed a stunning talent for musical cinema.\"\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song Bag Skyerne born?": [

Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the film stars David Niven, Roger Livesey, Raymond Massey, Kim Hunter and Marius Goring. The film was originally released in the United States under the title Stairway to Heaven, which derived from the film's most prominent special effect: a broad escalator linking Earth to the afterlife. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in Three- strip Technicolor, but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as\" Colour and Dye- Monochrome Processed in Technicolor\". This reversed the effect in\" The Wizard of Oz\". Photographic dissolves between\" Technicolor Dye- Monochrome\"( the Other World) and Three- Strip Technicolor( Earth) are used several times during the film. In 1999,\" A Matter of Life and Death\" placed 20th on the British Film Institute's list of Best 100 British films. In 2004, a poll by the magazine\" Total Film\" of 25 film critics named\" A Matter of Life and Death\" the second greatest British film ever made, behind\" Get Carter\".

He was also King consort of Scotland as a result of his marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots, from 1558 until his death in 1560. He ascended the throne of France at the age of fifteen after the accidental death of his father, Henry II, in 1559. His short reign was dominated by the first stirrings of the French Wars of Religion. Although the royal age of majority had been set at fourteen, his mother, Catherine de' Medici, entrusted the reins of government to his wife's uncles from the House of Guise, staunch supporters of the Catholic cause. They were unable to help Catholics in Scotland against the progressing Scottish Reformation, however, and the Auld Alliance was dissolved. Francis was succeeded by two of his brothers in turn, both of whom were also unable to reduce tensions between Protestants and Catholics.\nDocument[3](Title: Judith of Flanders) Judith of Flanders (or Judith of France) (843 \u2013 c. 870) was queen consort of Wessex and countess consort of Flanders.

Through her marriages to two Kings of Wessex, \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald, she was twice a queen. Her first two marriages were childless, but through her third marriage to Baldwin, she became the first Countess of Flanders and an ancestor of later Counts of Flanders. One of her sons by Baldwin married \u00c6lfthryth, a daughter of \u00c6thelbald's brother, Alfred the Great. She was also an ancestor of Matilda of Flanders, the consort of William the Conqueror, and thus of later monarchs of England.\nDocument[4](Title: Francis I of France) Francis I (12 September 1494 \u2013 31 March 1547) was King of France from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoul\u00eame, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the \"Mona Lisa\" with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \"le P\u00e8re et Restaurateur des Lettres\" (the \"Father and Restorer of Letters\"). He was also known as \"Fran\u00e7ois du Grand NezFrancis of the Large Nose\"), the \"Grand Colas\", and the \"Roi-Chevalier\" (the \"Knight-King\") for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\nDocument[5](Title: Judith of Flanders) Judith of Flanders( or Judith of France)( 843 \u2013 c. 870) was queen consort of Wessex and countess consort of Flanders.

With this documentary, Fri\u00f0riksson showcases the alternative music scene through several performances of the post -punk/ new wave most important bands at that time taken from different concerts and accompanied by, some times, short interviews with musicians, and it portrays the lifestyle of the Icelandic youth faced to the establishment and advocated to anarchy, who were trying to find their own identity. \" Rokk \u00ed Reykjav\u00edk\" is today considered as one of the most important documentaries about the Icelandic music culture and it included several important bands. For instance, Tappi T\u00edkarrass, a punk/ pop band led by vocalist Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir contributed with two of their works: \u201c Hrollur \u201d and \u201c D\u00fakkul\u00edsur \u201d.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Eiludd Powys) Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.\nDocument[2](Title: Beli ap Eiludd) Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th- century King of Powys. Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.\nDocument[3](Title: Beli ap Eiludd) Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th-century King of Powys.

Maelgwn was the son of Rhys ap Gruffydd (\"The Lord Rhys\") by his wife Gwenllian ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd prince of Powys. He appears in the historical record for the first time helping at the siege of Tenby in 1187. In 1188 when Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury and Giraldus Cambrensis travelled through Wales raising men for the Third Crusade, Maelgwn is recorded as having taken the cross, though there is no record that he actually went on the crusade. Maelgwn was described as being short in stature and a turbulent character, who caused his father much trouble in his later years and maintained a lengthy feud with his brother Gruffydd. He was kept a prisoner from 1189 to 1192. In 1194 he and his brother Hywel defeated their father in battle and imprisoned him in Nevern castle, though he was later released by Hywel. Maelgwn was in exile when Rhys died in 1197. Gruffydd had been recognised as his father's successor, but Maelgwn, helped by troops supplied by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys attacked and captured the town and castle of Aberystwyth, taking Gruffydd prisoner. Maelgwn handed Gruffydd over to Gwenwynwyn and took possession of Ceredigion. When Gwenwynwyn was defeated at Painscastle by Norman forces in 1198 Gruffydd was set free and recaptured all Ceredigion from Maelgwn except for the castles of Cardigan and Ystrad Meurig. Maelgwn came to an agreement with King John of England and sold Cardigan castle to John, taking possession of the remainder of Ceredigion himself. The annalist of Brut y Tywysogion commented: Gruffydd died in 1201, enabling Maelgwn to seize Cilgerran Castle, but in 1204 he lost it to William Marshall. In 1204 Maelgwn's men attacked his brother Hywel, leaving him with wounds of which he later died. In 1205 according to Brut y Tywysogion, Maelgwn caused a certain Irishman to kill Cedifor ap Gruffudd and his four sons with a battle-axe after they had been captured. The chronicler of Brut y Tywysogion again disapproved, describing Cedifor as \"a praiseworthy man, gracious, strong and generous\". In 1207 Maelgwn's ally, Gwenwynwyn of Powys fell out with King John and his lands were taken into the custody of the crown. Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd took advantage of this to annex the northern part of Ceredigion from Maelgwn and to give the lands between the River Ystwyth and the River Aeron to the sons of Gruffydd. Maelgwn helped King John to force Llywelyn to come to terms in 1211 but these lands were not returned to him, and this induced him to throw in his lot with Llywelyn instead of the king. However, when Llywelyn held a parliament at Aberdyfi in 1216, at which he redistributed the lands formerly under the rule of the Lord Rhys , Maelgwn was still only allowed the southern part of Ceredigion. Maelgwn died in 1230 in Llannerch Aeron and was buried at Strata Florida Abbey. His territory passed to his son, Maelgwn ap Maelgwn, called Maelgwn Fychan. In the late 1230s, the latter agreed a treaty with Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke, whereby Maelgwn Fychan's son, Rhys, would marry Gilbert's bastard daughter, Isabel, and receive the cantref of Is-Aeron, except the commote of Is-Hirwen (which contained Cardigan Castle), as dowry; in return Maelgwn Fychan and Rhys would become vassals of Gilbert (so far as it didn't compromise fealty to the king).\nDocument[5](Title: Llywelyn ap Dafydd) Llywelyn ap Dafydd (c.1267\u20131287), potential claimant to the title Prince of Gwynedd , was the eldest son of Dafydd ap Gruffydd, the last free ruler of Gwynedd, and his wife Elizabeth Ferrers. Nothing is known of his early life, though it is thought he was probably born some time around 1267. It is likely he accompanied his father during periods of exile in England in the 1270s. Following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd on 11 December 1282 the governance of Gwynedd was placed in the hands of Llywelyn's successor, his brother, Dafydd ap Gruffudd. Dafydd and his son Owain were captured together at Nanhysglain near to Bera Mawr in the uplands above Abergwyngregyn on 21 June 1283. King Edward I of England then issued orders for the apprehension of the primogeniture of Dafydd ap Gruffudd. On 29 June, Llywelyn ap Dafydd was arrested and taken to Rhuddlan to be imprisoned alongside his brother. A force of cavalry and infantry were deployed to escort Llywelyn and Owain out of Gwynedd via Acton Burnell in Shropshire to Bristol before the end of July 1283. After his father was executed for high treason in October 1283, he became the \"de jure\" Prince of Gwynedd. The only senior members of the Welsh royal family who retained their liberty were Llywelyn ap Dafydd's uncle Rhodri ap Gruffudd and cousin Thomas ap Rhodri, who had formally renounced their rights to the Principality. Llywelyn ap Dafydd died at Bristol Castle in 1287 and was buried in the nearby Dominican church (now known as Quakers Friars). His burial was paid for by King Edward I. His brother Owain would \"succeed\" him but would remain a prisoner until the end of his life.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?": [

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: R\u0119ce do g\u00f3ry) R\u0119ce do g\u00f3ry (known in its subtitled English version as Hands Up!) is a Polish drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his \"alter ego\", Andrzej Leszczyc. At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by studio. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schloendorff's German film \"Die F\u00e4lschung (Circle of Deceit)\", and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of \"Solidarnosc\", Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work \"Kosmogonia\" by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumil Kobiela, who died in 1969.

His 1963 film \"The Cry\" was entered into the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. It is often described as the first film of the Czechoslovak New Wave, a movement known for its dark humor, use of non-professional actors, and \"art-cinema realism\". Another of Jire\u0161's prominent works is \"The Joke\" (1969), adapted from a novel by Milan Kundera. It tells the story of Ludvik Jahn, a man expelled from the Czechoslovakian Communist Party for an idle joke to his girlfriend, and the revenge he later seeks through adultery. The film was produced during the political liberalization of the 1968 Prague Spring and contains many scenes which satirize and criticize the country's communist leadership. Released after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the film had initial success in theaters but was then banned by authorities for the next twenty years. Amos Vogel wrote that the film was \"possibly the most shattering indictment of totalitarianism to come out of a Communist country\". \"Valerie and Her Week of Wonders\" (1970), set in the early 19th century, was based on a novel by V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval. It is a film in a Gothic style concerning the onset of menstruation and the sexual awakening of a thirteen-year-old girl. His 1979 film \"The Young Man and Moby Dick\" was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. Following the Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia, Jire\u0161 continued to work in the country, making less controversial material. In 1971, he directed \"My Love to the Swallows\", a World War II film about a Czech resistance fighter. His 1982 film \"Incomplete Eclipse\" was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival.

Ang appeared in the 1962 film \"Love Never Ceases\", which featured the song \"Memories of an Old Love\" and several others written by Ang, which appeared on his second album \"Endless Love\", featuring original melodies. Ang spent the late 1960s and 1970s in Japan, as Kuomintang authorities censored Hokkien pop and other media. As restrictions against Hokkien media were lifted in the 1980s, and martial law was suspended, one of Ang's students, Jody Chiang, rose to stardom. Ang also wrote songs for his son Chris. By the time of his death, Ang had over 200 compositions to his name. Ang died from pancreatic cancer on 24 February 2010 at Taipei Medical University Hospital. His funeral was held on 13 March. He was posthumously awarded a Golden Melody Award for Special Contributions in June 2010. A virtual museum was set up in April 2011 to memorialize Ang's life and career. Ang's three sons produced and released a musical documentary about their father later that year.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the composer of song How Long Has This Been Going On??": [

Burroughs Jr. and Billy Burroughs. He bears the name of both his father and his great grandfather, William Seward Burroughs I, the original inventor of the Burroughs adding machine. He wrote three novels, two of which were published as \"Speed\" (1970) and \"Kentucky Ham\" (1973). His third novel, \"Prakriti Junction,\" begun in 1977, was never completed, although extracts from it were included in his third and final published work \"Cursed From Birth\". Burroughs Jr. underwent a liver transplant in 1976 after developing cirrhosis. He died in 1981, at the age of 33, from alcoholism and liver failure. Burroughs Jr. appears briefly in the 1983 documentary , about his father, in which he discusses his childhood, his liver problems, and his relationship with his family. In the documentary, John Giorno calls him \"the last beatnik.\"\nDocument[2](Title: John Coleman Burroughs) John Coleman \"Jack\" Burroughs (28 February 1913 \u2013 22 February 1979) was an American illustrator known for his illustrations of the works of his father, Edgar Rice Burroughs.\nDocument[3](Title: William S. Burroughs) William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914 \u2013 August 2, 1997) was an American writer and visual artist. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'. He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture. Much of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict, as he lived throughout Mexico City, London, Paris and the Tangier International Zone near Morocco, as well as from his travels in the South American Amazon. His work also features frequent mystical, occult or otherwise magical themes \u2013 a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life. Burroughs killed his second wife, Joan Vollmer, in 1951 in Mexico City. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a \"William Tell\" stunt. He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer. After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter \"in absentia\", and received a two-year suspended sentence. Burroughs found success with his confessional first novel, \"Junkie\" (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel \"Naked Lunch\" (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. sodomy laws. With Brion Gysin, he also popularized the literary cut-up technique in works such as The Nova Trilogy (1961\u20131964). In 1983, Burroughs was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1984 he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the \"greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift\", a reputation he owes to his \"lifelong subversion\" of the moral, political, and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous sardonicism. J. G. Ballard considered Burroughs to be \"the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War\", while Norman Mailer declared him \"the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius\". Burroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator Brion Gysin. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide. Burroughs had one child, William S. Burroughs Jr. (1947\u20131981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer. William Burroughs died at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, after suffering a heart attack in 1997.\nDocument[4](Title: John J. Burroughs) John Jay Burroughs( 1798 \u2013 1872) was an American lawyer and Clerk of the Circuit Court for Princess Anne County, Virginia( now the city of Virginia Beach). Burroughs was born in either Essex County or Middlesex County, Virginia on October 10, 1798. He was the eldest child of lighthouse builder and keeper Elzy Burroughs. Burroughs became the longest serving Clerk of the Circuit Court for Princess Anne County, Virginia in its history. During the American Civil War, Burroughs was the only functioning remnant of civil government in the county while it was occupied by Union forces. Burroughs entered his court career at age 17 in 1815 as a writer for the Hustings Court in Norfolk. In 1817 he qualified as Deputy Clerk, and in 1819 qualified as the Deputy Clerk of the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County Virginia. In 1821 he assumed the Clerkship upon the death of the incumbent clerk, remaining in this position until he was removed by the order of Union General Early in May 1869. Two of Burroughs' sons were John J.(\" Jack\") Burroughs, Jr. and Judge William Henry Burroughs, both prominent local attorneys and businessmen in Princess Anne County history. Jack Burroughs was educated at the Galt Academy in Norfolk and later at Lynchburg College in Lynchburg Virginia. William H. Burroughs attended The Virginia Military Institute, graduating in 1851 and the Law School of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, graduating in 1854. Burroughs' descendants remained prominent in Princess Anne County government and politics until the early 1930s, when a\" throw the bums out attitude\", rising out of the din of the economic Depression, led to a wholesale change of county leadership. At this same time the old family farm at Cedar Grove on Holland Road in Princess Anne County, Virginia, was sold out of the family. Burroughs was considered a progressive for his day, and was active in the efforts of the American Colonization Society to assist former slaves from Virginia to voluntarily resettle in the new nation of Liberia, in West Africa. There was little interest from the County's former slaves in this initiative, however. In recognition of his important role in Princess Anne County history, Mr. Burroughs' portrait hangs on the wall within the modern Virginia Beach Municipal Center.\nDocument[5](Title: William S.

It is a remake of the 1932 film and tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana( Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord. The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983. The film was shot in Louisville and in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder. De Palma dedicated this version of\" Scarface\" after the writers of the original, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht. \" Scarface\" was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed$ 44 million at the domestic box office and$ 65.9 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music as well as comic books, television programs, and video games, although over the years, the film has been regarded as a cult film.\nDocument[2](Title: Mister Scarface) Mister Scarface (originally l Padroni della citt\u00e0, also known as Rulers of the City) is a 1976 Italian \"poliziottesco\" film directed by Fernando Di Leo and starring Jack Palance.\nDocument[3](Title: Mister Scarface) Mister Scarface( originally l Padroni della citt\u00e0, also known as Rulers of the City) is a 1976 Italian\" poliziottesco\" film directed by Fernando Di Leo and starring Jack Palance.\nDocument[4](Title: John A.

The lyrics explore the pressure Bj\u00f6rk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of \"Homogenic\"; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Bj\u00f6rk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most music critics were enticed by \"Hunter\", which they declared one of the highlights of the \"Homogenic\" album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video for \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Bj\u00f6rk as she transforms into a \"techno-bear\" while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Bj\u00f6rk has performed \"Hunter\" on \" Later... with Jools Holland\" and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour.\nDocument[2](Title: Ian Hunter (singer)) Ian Hunter Patterson (born 3 June 1939), known as Ian Hunter, is an English singer-songwriter and musician who is best known as the lead singer of the English rock band Mott the Hoople, from its inception in 1969 to its dissolution in 1974, and at the time of its 2009 and 2013 reunions. Hunter was a musician and songwriter before joining Mott the Hoople, and continued in this vein after he left the band. He embarked on a solo career despite ill health and disillusionment with commercial success, and often worked in collaboration with Mick Ronson, David Bowie's sideman and arranger from the \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" period. Mott the Hoople achieved a certain level of commercial success, and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter charted with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. His best-known solo songs are \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\", later covered by Great White, and \"England Rocks\" , which was modified to \"Cleveland Rocks\" and then later covered by The Presidents of the United States of America, and became one of the theme songs used for the American TV series \"The Drew Carey Show\".\nDocument[3](Title: Bj\u00f6rk) Bj\u00f6rk was born on 21 November 1965 in Reykjav\u00edk, where she grew up.

William was the second son of Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick- L\u00fcneburg, and after the death of his father in 1815, was under the guardianship of King George IV of the United Kingdom. He became a Prussian major in 1823. When his brother, Charles, was deposed as ruling duke by a rebellion in 1830, William took over the government provisionally. In 1831, a family law of the House of Guelph made William the ruling duke permanently. William left most government business to his ministers, and he spent most of his time outside of his state at his possessions in Oels. While William joined the Prussian- led North German Confederation in 1866, his relationship to Prussia was strained, since Prussia refused to recognize Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, his nearest male- line relative, as his heir, because of the Duke of Cumberland's claim to the throne of Hanover. William died in 1884; he passed on his private possessions to the Duke of Cumberland. His death caused a constitutional crisis for Brunswick that lasted until the accession of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, the son of the Crown Prince of Hanover, in 1913.

He won great distinction at the battle of Hohenfriedberg as a major-general, and was promoted lieutenant-general in 1750. Bevern was one of the most experienced and exact soldiers in the army of Frederick the Great. He commanded a wing in the battle of Lobositz in 1756, and defeated the Austrians under Marshal K\u00f6nigsegg in a well-fought battle at Reichenberg on 21 April 1757. He took part in the battles of Prague and Kolin and the retreat to G\u00f6rlitz, and subsequently commanded the Prussians left behind by Frederick in the autumn of 1757 when he marched against the French. Bevern conducted a defensive campaign against overwhelming numbers with great skill, but he soon lost the valuable assistance of General Winterfeldt, who was killed in a skirmish at Moys; and he was eventually brought to battle and suffered a heavy defeat at the battle of Breslau on 22 November. He fell into the hands of the Austrians on the following morning, and remained prisoner for a year. He was made general of infantry in 1759, and on 11 August 1762 inflicted a severe defeat at Reichenbach on an Austrian army endeavouring to relieve Schweidnitz.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Arruns Tarquinius (brother of Tarquin the Proud)) Arruns Tarquinius was the brother of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome. According to most ancient authors, Arruns and his brother were the sons of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king, and Tanaquil. However, in some sources they are described as grandsons; their father may have been a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius, who according to an Etruscan tradition was defeated and killed by the heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, together with a certain\" Macstarna\". Apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin word\" magister\", Macstarna has been identified with Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome. According to legend, Servius had come to the palace as a child, following the capture of Corniculum by Tarquinius Priscus. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, discovered his potential for greatness by various omens. When the elder Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil gave out that he was merely wounded, and installed Servius as regent, preferring him to her own sons. The Etruscan tradition may preserve an account of a revolt by Tarquin's sons against Servius' magistracy. Servius married a daughter of the elder Tarquin, and in turn he gave his own daughters to Arruns and Lucius Tarquinius. Arruns Tarquinius was mild and unassuming, while his brother was ambitious. Arruns' wife, known to history as Tullia Minor, as she was the younger daughter, was similarly ambitious, while her elder sister was not. Tullia sought to place her husband on the throne, which would require her father's death. But as Arruns lacked the ambition to overthrow his father- in- law, Tullia contrived his murder, and that of her own sister, that she might marry Lucius. Once these deeds were accomplished, she and Lucius plotted her father's destruction. With a sudden and bloody palace coup, the pair deposed and murdered the king, and Lucius seized the throne. Lucius' second son was named after his murdered brother; but it was the overweening pride and arrogance of Lucius' sons that brought about the downfall of the Roman monarchy. The younger Arruns fell in battle against the consul Lucius Junius Brutus in 509 BC.\nDocument[2](Title: James B. Harris) James B.

He died October 28, 1948 in Michigan( car accident). He was among the first of the\" Singing cowboys\" of the 1930s and 1940s( whose ranks included Jimmie Rodgers, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers among others), and gained notoriety and national recognition as a broadcaster and singer on the infamous border radio station XEG during that time period. Rinehart was and is regarded among many as the original\" King of Border Radio,\" preceding Dallas\" Nevada Slim\" Turner, and\" Wolfman Jack,\" who were also famous for broadcasting from these stations. Border Radio,\" also called\" Border Blasters\" were names applied to several super powered radio stations that broadcast out of Mexico, and therefore, were not regulated by the U.S. broadcasting laws. They were extreme media powerhouses from the 1930s through the 1970s. These stations had towers so powerful that they were capable of transmitting their signals to a very large portion of the United States. Rinehart had his own radio program on XEG where he would sing and play guitar, as well as make infamous Border Radio product pitches for various items. The original\" cowboy's sweetheart,\" Patsy Montana, was often featured on the program with him. Cowboy Slim Rinehart had a notable influence on many future musician's careers. In addition to having an influence on Big Bill Lister and others, Rinehart helped shape Ernest Tubb's career. After Tubb signed onto Decca Records, he tried in vain to get Rinehart to do the same. Rinehart was wary of the recording industry, and feared a record deal would hurt his music book sales through XEG. During the 1940s, his persona had become notorious enough that Hollywood studios approached him to be featured in early singing cowboy westerns, but he vehemenently declined the proposals after he was told he would have to change his surname to something less\" German sounding.\" Rinehart had very good potential for a solid and legendary career in the country music scene, but tragically, his life came to an early end when he was killed in a car accident while on the way to finally record his first commercial record. Although the world has no commercial recordings available of Cowboy Slim Rinehart, recorded tapes of his radio program on XEG are still widely available through collectors and traders, and several of his songs can be found on country music compilation albums. Rinehart was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in October 1996, in recognition of his being a pioneer of the Texas music scene.\n\nQuestion: Where did the presenter of Tim Russert (Talk Show) die?": [

The title stems from an old Army song which includes lyrics \"You'll never get rich / by digging a ditch / you're in the Army now!\" This was Hayworth's first starring role in a big budgeted film from her home studio Columbia Pictures. While the film was in production, \"Life\" magazine put her on its cover, and featured inside a photo of Hayworth kneeling on a bed in a nightgown, which soon became one of the most widely distributed pin-ups of all time. Hayworth cooperated enthusiastically with Astaire's intense rehearsal habits, and was later to remark: \"I guess the only jewels in my life are the pictures I made with Fred Astaire\". The picture was very successful at the box office, turning Hayworth into a major star, and provided a welcome boost to Astaire, who felt his career had flagged since he had broken with Ginger Rogers.

The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative.

S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny represented Hungary at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics at the age of 22. He participated in all men's gymnastic events with highs of 29th in the Rings and 31st in the Vault competitions. He placed 64th in the Men's All-around competition. His personal gymnastics career was impacted by World War II as the 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games were canceled due to the war. The war and Nazi rule impacted S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny's personal life as well with his first marriage to friend and fellow gymnast, \u00c1gnes Keleti. A member of the Jewish faith, Keleti had heard a rumor that married women were not taken to labor camps so she hastily married S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny in 1944. They divorced in 1950 after the war ended. Keleti went on to Olympic fame winning 10 total medals during the 1952 Helsinki and 1956 Melbourne games. She remains one of the most decorated Olympic athletes of all time. She is regarded as the top Jewish Female athlete in Olympic history. Despite an injury that kept her from participating in the 1948 London games. Keleti received an 11th medal when the Hungarian women's team earned a silver in the all-around competition. S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny is most noted for his highly regarded and lengthy career as a Hungarian national and world gymnastics judge. He is noted in the official Olympic Game reports as judging the 1952 Helsinki Games Horizontal Bar competitions, the 1956 Melbourne Games (no specific apparatus), 1960 Rome Games Long Horse competitions and 1964 Tokyo Games Horizontal Bars competitions.

Although the French chronicler Jean Froissart called her\" the most beautiful woman in all the realm of England, and the most loving\", the appellation\" Fair Maid of Kent\" does not appear to be contemporary. Joan inherited the titles 4th Countess of Kent and 5th Baroness Wake of Liddell after the death of her brother, John, 3rd Earl of Kent, in 1352.\nDocument[2](Title: Edward IV of England) Edward IV (28 April 1442 \u2013 9 April 1483) was King of England from 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470, and again from 11 April 1471 until his death. His father, Richard of York, leader of the Yorkist faction, was a lineal descendant of Edward III and until 1453, heir presumptive to Henry VI, from the ruling House of Lancaster, or Lancastrians. Less than a year old when he came to the throne in September 1422 , Henry's minority was marked by political infighting within the Regency council. After 1437, he ruled in his own right but his weak and indecisive personality did little to mitigate factional conflict. Shortly after the birth of his son Edward of Westminster in 1453, Henry suffered a complete mental breakdown and the government descended into chaos. Conflict between Yorkists and Lancastrians led to civil war in 1455. This continued intermittently until 1485 and is collectively known as The Wars of the Roses. After Richard was executed in December 1460, Edward became head of the family; with the support of the Earl of Warwick, or 'The Kingmaker', he deposed Henry and was crowned king in June 1461. Divisions developed after Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464; Warwick switched sides in 1470 and restored Henry to the throne. Edward fled to Flanders, but returned to England in March 1471, winning victories at Barnet in April and Tewkesbury in May. Warwick, Henry's heir Edward of Westminster and other senior Lancastrians were killed, while Henry died in the Tower of London a few days later. England remained relatively peaceful until Edward's death in 1483. His two minor sons, Edward and Richard were subsequently declared illegitimate by his younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, who became Richard III.\nDocument[3](Title: Edward of Norfolk) Edward of Norfolk or Edward of Brotherton or Edward Plantagenet( c.1320 \u2013 before 9 August 1334), was the only son of Thomas of Brotherton, and a grandson of King Edward I of England. Born about 1320, Edward was the only son of Thomas of Brotherton, eldest son of King Edward I by his second marriage to Margaret of France( 1279? \u2013 1318), the daughter of King Philippe III of France( d.1285). His mother was Alice Hales( d. in or before 1330), daughter of Sir Roger Hales of Hales Hall in Loddon in Roughton, Norfolk, by his wife Alice. He had two sisters: Shortly after 29 May 1328, at Hereford, Edward of Norfolk married Beatrice de Mortimer, daughter of Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, by Joan de Joinville( d.1356), daughter and coheiress of Sir Peter de Joinville. The occasion was a double wedding at which the bride's sister, Agnes Mortimer, married Laurence Hastings, later 1st Earl of Pembroke. The celebrations were accompanied by a magnificent tournament, and were attended by Edward III and his mother, Isabella of France, who was by then the mistress of the bride's father, Roger de Mortimer. There was no issue of the marriage, and two years after the ceremony Roger de Mortimer was hanged at Tyburn as a common criminal. Edward of Norfolk died before 9 August 1334, predeceasing his father. His widow married, before 13 September 1337, Sir Thomas de Brewes( d. 9 or 16 June 1361), son and heir of Sir Peter de Brewes of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and his wife Agnes de Clifford, by whom she had three sons and three daughters. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton about 20 September 1338, Edward of Norfolk's elder sister, Margaret, succeeded to the earldom of Norfolk.\nDocument[4](Title: Eleanor of England, Countess of Bar) Eleanor of England (18 June 1269 \u2013 29 August 1298) was an English princess, the eldest surviving daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile. What evidence exists for Eleanor's early years suggests that while her parents were absent on Crusade between 1270 and 1274, she became very close to her paternal grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, with whom she continued to spend a good deal of time. She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain. She died at Ghent on 29 August 1298. Eleanor was buried in Westminster Abbey but the location of her grave in the Abbey is unknown.\nDocument[5](Title: Edward II of England) Edward II (25 April 1284 \u2013 21 September 1327), also called Edward of Carnarvon, was King of England from 1307 until he was deposed in January 1327. The fourth son of Edward I, Edward became the heir apparent to the throne following the death of his elder brother Alphonso. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on campaigns to pacify Scotland, and in 1306 was knighted in a grand ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Following his father's death, Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307. He married Isabella, the daughter of the powerful King Philip IV of France, in 1308, as part of a long-running effort to resolve tensions between the English and French crowns. Edward had a close and controversial relationship with Piers Gaveston, who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of his and Gaveston's relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or sworn brothers. Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play \"Edward II\", along with other plays, films, novels and media. Gaveston's power as Edward's favourite provoked discontent among both the barons and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to exile him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the king into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms, called the Ordinances of 1311. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Widespread famine followed, and criticism of the king's reign mounted. The Despenser family, in particular Hugh Despenser the Younger, became close friends and advisers to Edward, but Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands in 1321, and forced the king to exile them. In response, Edward led a short military campaign, capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Instead, she allied herself with the exiled Roger Mortimer, and invaded England with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled to Wales, where he was captured in November. The king was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his 14-year-old son, Edward III, and he died in Berkeley Castle on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate over his perceived failures has continued into the 21st century.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mother of Edward I Of England?": [

Media commentators have suggested the song was inspired by Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel \"Lolita\", and noted that its lyrics greatly diverge from the source material. \"Lolita\" was positively received by music critics, who praised its chorus, Williams' production, and LaBelle's vocal performance. The single ranked number seven on the Dance Club Songs \"Billboard\" chart in the United States. Internationally, it peaked at number 264 on the official Tophit airplay chart. To promote \"Lolita\", LaBelle sang an acoustic version for \"Rap-Up\", and performed the original version at various venues, such as New York Fashion Week and the Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend. Directed by Diane Martel, the single's accompanying music video features LaBelle as Lolita and shows how she seduces boys from her neighborhood. The video received attention due to its focus on sexuality. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church strongly criticized Martel's creation of sexually-explicit music videos, and Idolator selected the carwash scene as an instance in which the video emphasized sexuality. Despite the criticism, LaBelle's performance garnered positive reviews.\nDocument[2](Title: Leah LaBelle) Leah LaBelle Vladowski (September 8, 1986 \u2013 January 31, 2018) was an American singer.

In an effort to increase the Romanian work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. With the fall of Communism, many children from the orphanages moved into the streets while others were runaways from impoverished families. Today there are 20,000 children living in the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited. \"Children Underground\" follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children. Some of them landed in state-funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta 'Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname 'Macarena' derives from the song \"Macarena\", her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled. The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac.

Nowhere is this balancing act more evident than on \"Rape,\" a rather disquieting extended metaphor for his mastery of hip-hop (other MCs just \"ain't fuckin' it right Primarily, the song is a satirical response to rapper Common's classic \"I Used to Love H.E.R.,\" a nostalgic song that features a feminized personification of hip-hop as a lost love that has fallen to vice. Pharoahe Monch's more graphic and violent rendition is accordingly a critique of the vapid state of contemporary mainstream hip-hop, conveyed from the perspective of a variously passionate or obsessed rapist, equally infatuated by hip-hop as a woman. As Huey points out, \"Rape\" equally is an extended metaphor for Pharoahe's technical mastery of hip-hop. Personification and extended metaphor are techniques widely employed by hip-hop lyricists.

The parent album, released a few weeks later, was unaffected and charted in the top 10. \" Hammer Horror\" proved to be a temporary blip as Bush's next single returned her to the top 20. In other countries it fared better, such as Ireland, where it reached No. 10. In Australia, Kate Bush devised the dance routine for the song in her Melbourne hotel room, and performed the song on the television show, Countdown. The song references Hammer Films, a company specializing in horror movies. However, Bush conceived of the song after viewing the film \"Man of a Thousand Faces\", a biographical film about Lon Chaney starring James Cagney. \"The song was inspired by seeing James Cagney playing the part of Lon Chaney playing the hunchback,\" Bush stated in 1979. \"He was an actor in an actor in an actor, rather like Chinese boxes, and that's what I was trying to create. \" The story of the song concerns an actor who gets thrust into the lead role of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" after the original actor dies in an accident on the film set. The guilt-ridden narrator of the song ends up being haunted by the ghost of the jealous original actor, who was a former friend.

Young was born in Cheltenham, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, established himself as a leading director of British TV drama. In the 1970s, he directed \"Vampire Circus\" (1972), \"Soldier's Home\" (1977) and \"Hammer House of Horror\". He directed several episodes of \"Minder\" and \"Bergerac\" in the early 1980s, and the acclaimed TV serial \"The Mad Death\" which centred on a rabies outbreak. Perhaps his best remembered television work was on \"Robin of Sherwood\", for which he directed many of the best-regarded episodes. Young moved towards black comedy in the early 1990s, directing \"Jeeves and Wooster\" based on the stories written by P.G. Wodehouse, and \"G.B.H.\", for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award. It was partly on the strength of \"GBH\" that he was assigned to direct \"Fierce Creatures\", John Cleese's 1997 follow-up to \"A Fish Called Wanda\", which featured many of the same cast as \"GBH\".

Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility. \"Deep Blue Sea\" had a budget of $82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since \"Cliffhanger\" in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film \"Titanic\". Although \"Deep Blue Sea\" features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film: \"Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)\" and \"Say What\". Released in theaters during the film industry's summer season, \"Deep Blue Sea\" was a moderate commercial success, grossing more than $73 million in the United States and Canada, and $164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions. Retrospectively, \"Deep Blue Sea\" has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that has been dominated by Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller \"Jaws\".

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking.

They originally played hardcore punk in the vein of bands such as Black Flag and The Circle Jerks. In 1998 they added second guitarist Lars Swenson and began cultivating a dirtier' 70s glam- rock sound, as heard on their eMpTy Records releases. The records sold fairly well and gained them the attention of larger labels such as DreamWorks and Sub Pop, the latter of whom signed the band to a recording contract in 1999. Over the course of their career they did extensive roadwork, touring North America and Europe with bands such as Sparta, Mudhoney, Run Run Run, Division of Laura Lee, and, often, the Murder City Devils. Waude and Swenson left the band in 2001 for other projects, and the Catheters continued as a 4- piece with longtime roadie Leo Gebhardt joining as bassist. In 2002, with the help of a popular music video, they scored an indie hit with the song\" Nothing\", from their album\" Static Delusions and Stone- Still Days\"( Sub Pop, 2002). After releasing more singles and touring heavily in 2002 and 2003, the band released the acclaimed album\" Howling ... It Grows and Grows !!!\" ( Sub Pop, 2004), which infused their earlier sound with elements of classic rock. The Catheters played their final show on October 15, 2004 at Seattle's Sunset Tavern, joined by friends the Vells and blackbelt( who played some old- school Catheters covers), ending the show with a mass sing- along to their song'\" Fake ID\" which degenerated into instrument destruction and a minor brawl.

Howard in the 1930s. Produced by Jetlag Productions and Sunbow Productions, the series debuted on September 13, 1992, ran for 65 episodes and concluded on November 22, 1993. The series was developed by Christy Marx who served as the sole story editor. The series was produced in association with Graz Entertainment for the first 13-episode season; AB Productions and Jean Chalopin's Cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et D\u00e9veloppement for the remaining episodes. The series also spawned a small toyline in 1992 created by Hasbro.

Howard) Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 \u2013 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding, eventually taking up amateur boxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death. Although a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was \"Weird Tales\", where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly-read author, with his best works still reprinted. Howard's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis his entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car and shot himself in the head.\nDocument[4](Title: Conan the Adventurer) Conan the Adventurer may refer to:\nDocument[5](Title: Tales of Conan) Tales of Conan is a 1955 collection of four fantasy short stories by American writers Robert E. Howard and L. Sprague de Camp, featuring Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. The tales as originally written by Howard were adventure yarns mostly set in the Middle Ages; they were rewritten as Conan stories by de Camp, who also added the fantastic element. Three of the stories also appeared in the fantasy magazine\" Fantastic Universe\", two of them before publication of the collection and the other one after. The book has also been translated into Japanese. The collection never saw publication in paperback; instead, its component stories were split up and distributed among other\" Conan\" collections. \" The Flame Knife\" was later also published as an independent paperback. Chronologically, the four short stories collected as\" Tales of Conan\" represent an add- on to Gnome's Conan series, coming between stories published in the remaining volumes. The first\" tale\" would fall within the collection\" The Coming of Conan\", the second between that volume and the collection\" Conan the Barbarian\", the third within\" Conan the Barbarian\", and the fourth between that volume and the collection\" The Sword of Conan\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the creator of Conan The Adventurer (1992 Tv Series)?": [

The original 1933 hit was performed by Freddy Martin, and the 1952 remake (inspired by the movie of the same name) was by the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, whose version made the Cashbox Top 50. Composer Alec Wilder writes, \"There are no two ways about it: this is a perfect theater song. If that sounds too reverent, then I'll reduce the praise to 'perfectly wonderful,' or else say that if it's not perfect, show me why it isn't.\" Freddy Martin and Henry King had the earliest hits of this song, at the very end of 1933. It has been performed by many artists, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Billy Eckstine, Bill Evans, Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Frank Sinatra, Mary Kaye Trio, Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Erroll Garner, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Benny Goodman, Dinah Shore, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Joni James, Blossom Dearie, Doris Day, Alex Chilton, Wynton Marsalis, Andy Williams, Michel Legrand, and Dawn Upshaw. Basie's 1955 recording is the most famous, and that particular performance was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. On this recording, trumpeter Thad Jones played his famous \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" solo, trombonist Benny Powell performed his much noted bridge, and Basie directs the band to play the short chorus \"one more time\" and then \"one more once.\" According to the niece of Matteo Boccino, \"April in Paris\" was composed on a 1931 Mathushek baby grand piano located in Boccino's 54th Street rehearsal hall as \"Walk a Little Faster\" prepared for its Broadway debut. During rehearsal, Duke concluded another song was needed and it was composed on the spot. Boccino's rehearsal studio was among dozens of buildings demolished in 1964 to make space for the still standing New York Hilton Hotel. The 1931 Mathushek baby grand is now owned by Michael Adams of Montville, New Jersey and many pianists have even recently played \"April in Paris\" on the very piano on which it was composed. The song is also featured in the film \"Blazing Saddles\" from 1974, being played by Count Basie in a cameo appearance.

It was fundamentally liberal, but serious- minded, theologically inclined, profoundly Erasmian; as the court of Catherine of Aragon had once been. It was from this court that his daughter Anne would be raised. Anne would go on to marry King Henry VIII of England as his fourth wife.\nDocument[3](Title: John I, Duke of Cleves) John I, Duke of Cleves, Count of Mark (16 February 1419 \u2013 5 September 1481) was Duke of Cleves and Count of Mark.\nDocument[4](Title: John II, Duke of Cleves) John II, \"The Babymaker\", Duke of Cleves, Count of Mark, (German: Johann II. \" der Kindermacher\", Herzog von Kleve, Graf von Mark) (13 April 1458 \u2013 15 March 1521) was a son of John I, Duke of Cleves and Elizabeth of Nevers.

Nabersberg was the son of a Crefeld shopkeeper. In 1923 he joined the Jugendorganisation, the forerunner of the Hitler Youth, in his home town. On 28 December 1925 he was admitted as a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party( member number 26269) and as a member of the Sturmabteilung. After school, he studied law at the University of Cologne and Humboldt University of Berlin, although he never graduated. He participated in the founding of the Cologne local NSDAP and served from 1928 to 1929 as a high- school group leader of the National Socialist German Students' League as well as a group leader of the General Student Committee at Humboldt University. From November 1931 to June 1934 was Stabsf\u00fchrer of the Hitler Youth and deputy to Reichsjugendf\u00fchrer Baldur von Schirach. In July 1933, Schirach dissolved the Reich Committee of German Youth Associations which represented 135 different youth groups. Nabersberg led a raid on the Berlin headquarters of the Committee, with a handful of Sturmabteilung men and 50 armed teenagers from the Hitler Youth. ( The figure of 50 armed teenagers comes from Baldur von Schirach's 1934 book\" Die Hitler \u2013 Jugend\" and may be exaggerated. A postwar account by Helene Gehse, one of five staff at the headquarters, reported a very small number of Hitler Youth, one of whom was armed with an old carbine.) During the raid, Hermann Maa\u00df was summoned and threatened by Nabersberg before being told to leave the building. Schirach named Nabersberg as one of the\" Pioneers of the Third Reich\" in his 1933 book. From July 1934 he became head of the Border and International Relations Office of the Hitler Youth, promoting ethnic politics amongst Germanic youth in neighbouring countries. In January 1935 he resigned this position for health reasons and assumed the duties of an Obergebietsf\u00fchrer of the Hitler Youth. In November 1937 he met Lord Baden- Powell with a view to forging closer ties between the Hitler Youth and The Scout Association. After the war, the West Berlin Denazification Tribunal fined Nabersberg \u211b\u2133 6,000. He died in 1946.\n\nQuestion: Who is younger, Nicolas G\u00f6rtler or Michel De Salzmann?": [

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Anthemiolus) Anthemiolus (died c. 471 AD) was the son of the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius (467\u2013472) and Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern Roman emperor Marcian. His name means \"little Anthemius\" and is a diminutive of his and his father's name Anthemius, in order to distinguish them both. His life is known only from the \"Chronica Gallica of 511\". He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals \u2014 Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus \u2014 in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The \"Chronica\", in entry 649, states: Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, \"comes\" [or \"comitesstabuli\": King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone and, having killed the \"duces\", laid everything waste. According to the \"Chronica\", this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471\u2013472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near D\u00e9ols. It is not impossible that Anthemiolus' army was sent to reinforce Riothamus and that Euric defeated both forces in turn, probably in either 470 or 471.\nDocument[2](Title: Hank Williams Jr.) Randall Hank Williams (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as Hank Williams Jr., or alternatively as \"Bocephus\", is an American country music & southern rock singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style is often considered a blend of Southern rock, blues, and country. He is the son of country music singer Hank Williams, the half-brother of Jett Williams, and the father of Hank Williams III, Holly Williams, Hilary Williams, Sam Williams and Katie Williams. Williams began his career following in his famed father's, Hank Williams, footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a 1964 episode of ABC's \"The Jimmy Dean Show\", in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ABC's \"Shindig!\". Williams' style evolved slowly as he struggled to find his own voice and place within country music. This was interrupted by a near-fatal fall off the side of Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975. After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues. Williams enjoyed much success in the 1980s, from which he earned considerable recognition and popularity both inside and outside country music. As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums. From 1989 through October 2011, and since 2017, his song \" All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,\" refashioned as \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night,\" was used to open broadcasts of \"Monday Night Football\".\nDocument[3](Title: Romulus (son of Anthemius)) Romulus (fl. 469\u2013479 AD) was a member of the House of Theodosius, son of Western Roman Emperor Anthemius.\nDocument[4](Title: Ferus Mustafov) Ferus Mustafov, also known as King Ferus Mustafov, is a Macedonian saxophonist of Romani descent.

Jennings began playing guitar at age eight and began performing at age twelve on KVOW radio, after which he formed his first band, The Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and bounced around as a performer and DJ on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI, KLLL, in Coolidge, Arizona, and Phoenix. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings's first recording session, and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the ill-fated flight in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, J. P. \" The Big Bopper\" Richardson and Ritchie Valens. Jennings formed a rockabilly club band, The Waylors, which became the house band at \"JD's\", a club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and A&M Records, but did not achieve success until moving to RCA Victor, taking on Neil Reshen as a manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts for him. After finally wresting creative control from RCA Victor, his career turning point became the critically acclaimed albums \"Lonesome, On'ry and Mean\" and \"Honky Tonk Heroes\", followed by hit LPs \"Dreaming My Dreams\" and \"Are You Ready for the Country\". During the 1970s, Jennings was instrumental in the inception of outlaw country and with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter recorded country music's first platinum album, \"Wanted! The Outlaws\". It was followed by \"Ol' Waylon\" and the hit song \"Luckenbach, Texas\". Jennings was featured in the 1978 album \"White Mansions\", performed by various artists documenting the lives of people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Jennings also appeared in films and television series, including Sesame Street, and a stint as the balladeer for \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", composing and singing the show's theme song and providing narration for the show. By the early 1980s, Jennings struggled with a cocaine addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album \"Will the Wolf Survive\". He toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. In 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the Academy of Country Music.\nDocument[2](Title: This Time (Waylon Jennings song)) \"This Time\" is a song written and performed by the American country music artist Waylon Jennings.

Rising artists Valens, Richardson and Dion and the Belmonts had joined the tour as well. The long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of flu and even frostbite. After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by such conditions, Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Richardson, who had the flu, swapped places with Jennings, taking his seat on the plane, while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss.\nDocument[4](Title: Otis Redding) Otis Ray Redding Jr. (September 9, 1941 \u2013 December 10, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s. Redding was born in Dawson, Georgia, and at the age of 2, moved to Macon, Georgia. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first single, \"These Arms of Mine\", in 1962. Stax released Redding's debut album, \"Pain in My Heart\", two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South. He later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Shortly before his death in a plane crash, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" with Steve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and R&B charts. The album \"The Dock of the Bay\" was the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the Atco division of Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog. Redding received many posthumous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition to \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,Respect\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" are among his best-known songs.\nDocument[5](Title: The Passing of Hell's Crown) The Passing of Hell's Crown is a 1916 American silent western film featuring Harry Carey.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of the performer of song This Time (Waylon Jennings Song)?": [

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \"Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film, \"The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's \"Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\" (1925). \"The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, \"Wara Wara\" (1930) and \"Hacia la Gloria\" (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and \"Wara Wara\" remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \" Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for\" his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/ native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry\" at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film,\" The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's\" Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\"( 1925). \" The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its\" social critique\" and\" because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films,\" Wara Wara\"( 1930) and\" Hacia la Gloria\"( 1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and\" Wara Wara\" remains\" the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent- film era\". He also made short documentary films,\" before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is\" Amerindia\"( 1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico.

He became Count of Chiny in 1268 when his parents entrusted him with the county before their death. In 1285, he brought to Chauvency-le-Ch\u00e2teau one of the most famous jousting tournaments (a \u201ctournament of chivalry\u201d) of the Middle Ages, which pitted knights from the Empire, France, Lotharingia, Hainault, Flanders, and England, against each other in two days of solo-contest jousting and a final day of massed m\u00eal\u00e9e fighting. The Tournament of Chauvency  was described in verse by the French poet Jacques Bretel. A list of the participants at the tournament, which includes nearly 100 named individuals, can be found here. Before 22 July 1257, he married Jeanne de Bar (1225-1299), widow of Frederick de (d. 1255/6) and daughter of Henry II, Count of Bar, and Philippa de Dreux. Her dowry was the castle of Salm. Jeanne already had three children from her first marriage: Henry (d.1331) sire de Bl\u00e2mont and seneschal of Lorraine, Joffroi (mentioned in 1253) and Thomas (\"princier\" of Verdun and subsequently Bishop, d.1305).

Although he probably did not use the title, Otto is regarded as the first Count of Chiny. Historically, an Otto of Vermandois is mentioned in a charter of 958 alongside his father, the Count of Vermandois. His name and that of his brother Ludolfe show a Germanic ancestry of the kings of the family of Saxony, which is indeed the case, as his mother is Gerberge of Lorraine, niece of Emperor Otto I (her mother being daughter to Henry the Fowler). He was reported as a quarrelsome lord who threatened Hainaut and Cambr\u00e9sis (the region around Cambrai). In 971, an Otto erected a fortress in Warcq, in the Ardennes, and attacked his neighbors, including Adalbero, Archbishop of Reims. He is mentioned as having imperial ancestry. This and a number of other facts prompted the historian L\u00e9on Vanderkindere to hypothesize that these two Ottos were in fact a single historical figure. His wife\u2019s name is unknown. It is possible that she was from Ardennes, a relative of Wigeric of Lotharingia and Cunigunda of France, granddaughter of Louis the Stammerer. This could explain the name of his son and the appointment of the latter as Count of Verdun in 1024. Otto and his wife had one child:\nUpon his death, Otto was succeeded as Count of Chiny by his son Louis.\n\nQuestion: Who is Joan, Countess Of Chiny's paternal grandfather?": [

He succeeded to his father's title and responsibilities on the latter's death in 1057. He gained the additional title of Earl of East Anglia, but also was exiled for a time. Through the first marriage of his daughter he would become father-in-law of the Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn; a few years after his death, his daughter would become a widow and marry English King Harold.\nDocument[2](Title: \u00c6lfwynn) \u00c6lfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918. She was the daughter of \u00c6thelred, ruler of English Mercia, and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d( styled The Lady of Mercia). The\" Anglo- Saxon Chronicle\" states that she was\" deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas\".

She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule \u2013 East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings \u2013 but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d to \u00c6thelred. \u00c6thelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. \u00c6thelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. \u00c6thelred died in 911 and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as \"one of the most unique events in early medieval history\". Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as \"her greatest triumph\". In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was succeeded by her daughter \u00c6lfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried \u00c6lfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d but they agree that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as \"a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul\". According to Pauline Stafford, \"like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages\". In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of \u00c6lfgar, Earl Of Mercia's mother?": [

He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films were more diverse in genre, among which included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years. DeMille directed \"The King of Kings\" (1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. \" The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \"Cleopatra\" (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), a biblical epic which became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism\", which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. His last and best known film, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, is currently the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for \"Union Pacific\" (1939), a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was named in his honor.

Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel\" The Godfather\", the film is both sequel and prequel to\" The Godfather\", presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone( Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone crime family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone( De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. Following the success of the first film, Paramount Pictures began developing a follow up to the film, with much of the same cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more control on the film, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to the film to tell the story of the rise of Vito and the fall of Michael. Principal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. \" The Godfather Part II\" premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974, receiving divided reviews from critics but its reputation, however, improved rapidly and it soon became the subject of critical re-evaluation. It grossed$ 88 million worldwide on a$ 13 million budget. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards at the 47th Academy Awards and became the first sequel to win for Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Both\" The Godfather Part II\" and its predecessor remain highly influential films, especially in the gangster genre, and the former has been reevaluated. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd- greatest film in American film history and it retained this position 10 years later. Some have deemed it superior to\" The Godfather\". It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993, being deemed\" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

He was the son of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde and Honora Burke. Knighted in 1602 for his exploits as leader of the English cavalry during the Battle of Kinsale, he would later serve as Governor of Connaught from 1604 to 1616, and as a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. Having established himself as the largest and most influential landowner in Connacht, his later life was characterized by animosity between him and an increasingly hostile and acquisitive Dublin government. He actively served Queen Elizabeth I against the rebel Irish lordships and their Spanish allies during the Nine Years' War. He was appointed governor of Connaught, member of the privy council in Ireland, and, in 1624, created Viscount Tunbridge and Baron of Somerhill, a manor which he owned in Kent. The titles of Viscount Galway and Earl of St. Albans were conferred on him in 1628. By 1633 he was not only one of the principal landowners in Ireland, but virtually all powerful in County Galway. This aroused the resentment of the Dublin Government, which decided to use the method of empanelling juries to \"find\" defective titles, in order to recover the lands in question for the English Crown. The treatment which Lord Clanricarde experienced from the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, was said to have accelerated his death in November 1635: Wentworth however pointed to the Earl's advancing years and asked sarcastically if he was to blame for a man being over sixty. The feud, which was continued by Clanricarde's son and heir, was in the long run very damaging to Strafford, who apparently did not reflect on the close connections Clanricarde, through his wife, had with just that faction of the English nobility, the Rich-Devereux clan, who were most hostile to Strafford. In 1603, he married Frances Walsingham, the widow of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. They had one son, Ulick, and two daughters, Honora, who married John Paulet, 5th Marquis of Winchester, and Mary, wife of Hon. Edward Butler of Ballinahinch.

He was the son of Ulick na gCeann Burke, 1st Earl of Clanricarde and Grace O'Carroll. He married: 1) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond and Eleanor FitzGerald, before 6 October 1548; 2) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond and Helen Butler, on 24 November 1553; and 3) Julia MacCarthy, daughter of Cormac 'Oge' MacCarthy, in 1568. He and his first wife, Margaret O'Brien (daughter of Murrough) were divorced after he claimed that she worked witchcraft against him. As a result of his father's multiple marriages and relationships there were a number of candidates contending for title Earl of Clanricarde. Richard, the oldest legitimate son, was the eventual successor. He was sporadically opposed by his brothers and half-brothers, including John, who claimed the title in 1568. Richard extended his influence at the expense of the O'Kelly's and the O'Madden's in the east of County Galway, overlordship over the O'Shaughnessey in the south, while allying himself with the O'Conor Don and the O'Brien of Thomond. Other minor allies included the MacCostelloe and MacMorris, who acknowledged him to avoid encroachment from the Bourkes of Mayo. In 1559 Clanricarde fought on the losing side at the Battle of Spancel Hill in County Clare as part of the Gaelic O'Brien succession dispute. From around 1570 his sons rebelled against him and the Anglo-Irish government. That decade witnessed regular warfare across the county which devastated towns such as Galway, Athenry and Loughrea. At the time of his death Burke had endured imprisonment in Dublin, and repeated treachery by his sons. After his death, further warfare was avoided when Ulick Burke killed his brother, John of the Shamrocks, and was acknowledged as the 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. He was called \"Sassanach\" (Saxon, or Englishman), because of his association with the Anglo-Irish. He died on 24 July 1582.\n\nQuestion: Who is Richard Burke, 4Th Earl Of Clanricarde's paternal grandfather?": [

He was born in Macei\u00f3, Alagoas, and is best known as a member of the Cinema Novo movement. He is popularly known for his unconventional, yet intriguing film techniques among other film producers of the Cinema Novo movement. Diegues is also widely known for his dynamic use visuals, ideas, plots, themes, and other cinematic techniques. He incorporated many musical acts in his film as he favored musical pieces to be complementary of his ideas. Diegues remains very popular and is regarded one the most cinematic producers of his generation. Of the Cinema Novo directors, he would go on to produce films, plays, musicals and other forms of entertainment in Brazil. Diegues' contributions to Brazilian cinema developed the film industry. He would pioneer expensive film projects that domestic filmmakers had ever seen. Films such as\" Bye Bye Brazil\" were two million dollar projects and later on films such as\" God is Brazilian\" would be over 10 million dollars. This was a new era in Brazil as domestic directors had yet to produce any films with that kind of financial support. He admits to using Brazilians in his films as much as he can. Diegues would use extras, film technicians, painters, sculptors and other essential personnel of Brazilian backgrounds even if they were inexperienced. Diegues attempted to consistently represent the underrepresented people of Brazil in his films. He suggests that history is written by the winners and the afro-Brazilian communities were not among those who were given a chance to write their own history. He also proposed the idea that up until this movement, cinema in Brazil only provided the white Brazilian experience despite the growing masses of black Brazilians all over the country. He is known for distinguished publications that uplift the Afro-Brazilian spirit and bodies. In 2018, Diegues was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, Retalhos Da Vida De Um M\u00e9dico or The Shooting?": [

The magazine was originally known as \"Harp Magazine\" for over 10 years, also based in Silver Spring, and was considered one of the best music magazines of the decade in the early 2000s. After \"Harp\" folded in March 2008 (at the behest of its parent company, which also owned JazzTimes, it declared bankruptcy), \"Blurt\" was founded by \"Harp\" owner Scott Crawford. Some of the main writers and editors for \"Harp\" also started \"Blurt\" with Crawford, including managing editor Fred Mills (of Asheville, NC, and also a contributing editor to \"StereophileMagnet\" and other music industry publications and alternative weeklies), senior editor Randy Harward (also an editor for the Salt Lake City weekly paper), and senior editor Andy Tennille (a journalist and photographer, currently the photographer for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers). \"Blurt\"s tag line is \"Real Music, Real Artists, Real OpinionsBlurt\" is a highly respected outlet within the music industry and has often been cited by critics and fans as the \"Mojo\" magazine of the United States. It initially launched as an all-digital, downloadable online magazine, publishing five issues in that format before moving to print for the next nine issues while also posting each issue online, frequently with expanded content, at BlurtOnline.com. In early 2010, Crawford sold the \"Blurt\" assets to Stephen Judge of Second Motion Entertainment and the company moved to the label's home of Carrboro, NC. Second Motion Entertainment also owns the record label Second Motion Records which works with such artists as Australia's The Church, Bettie Serveert, Swervedriver, Parson Red Heads and Tommy Keene. \"Blurt\" magazine announced in February 2012 that it would be relocating its offices (along with Second Motion) to Raleigh, NC, where Judge had purchased long-tenured independent record store Schoolkids Records. Editor Mills also relocated to Raleigh, assisting Judge in both running the store and publishing the magazine. As of April 2017, Schoolkids also operates locations in Durham, NC, and Carrboro, NC, and the Second Motion Records name has been changed to Schoolkids Records. The magazine, label and stores are increasingly integrated, operationally. \"Blurt\" is updated daily with new music interviews, essays and features; music news, record release announcements (vinyl is a specialty), and tour dates; exclusive videos, audio streams and bootleg MP3s; record, DVD, book and concert reviews; and blog entries by Judge, Mills, John B. Moore, Michael Toland, and Bill Kopp. Tim Hinely, founder of \"Dagger\", a punk and indie zine first published in 1987 and still in print, and recognized by \"Pitchfork\" as \"one of the best,\" is also a contributor.

The final print issue was #14, published at the end of 2013 and featuring Artist of the Year Jason Isbell on the cover, along with features on The Beatles, Big Star, The Replacements, Megafaun, Tommy Keene and King Khan. At that point the magazine decided to revert to publishing online in the face of declining advertising revenue. While operating as a print publication, covers were devoted to artists such as: Sonic Youth, The Avett Brothers, PJ Harvey, Of Montreal, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Spiritualized Grizzly Bear and Wilco.

John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as \"John II of Baden\". His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II's reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law. In 1477, he officiated in the wedding of Maximilian of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co-adjutor with the right to succeed  and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier.

The eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe. He was heir apparent to the British throne and held the title of Prince of Wales for longer than any of his predecessors. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother. As king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, was poor. The Edwardian era, which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911, which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords.\nDocument[3](Title: Edward IV of England) Edward IV (28 April 1442 \u2013 9 April 1483) was King of England from 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470, and again from 11 April 1471 until his death. His father, Richard of York, leader of the Yorkist faction, was a lineal descendant of Edward III and until 1453, heir presumptive to Henry VI, from the ruling House of Lancaster, or Lancastrians. Less than a year old when he came to the throne in September 1422 , Henry's minority was marked by political infighting within the Regency council. After 1437, he ruled in his own right but his weak and indecisive personality did little to mitigate factional conflict. Shortly after the birth of his son Edward of Westminster in 1453, Henry suffered a complete mental breakdown and the government descended into chaos. Conflict between Yorkists and Lancastrians led to civil war in 1455. This continued intermittently until 1485 and is collectively known as The Wars of the Roses. After Richard was executed in December 1460, Edward became head of the family; with the support of the Earl of Warwick, or 'The Kingmaker', he deposed Henry and was crowned king in June 1461. Divisions developed after Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464; Warwick switched sides in 1470 and restored Henry to the throne. Edward fled to Flanders, but returned to England in March 1471, winning victories at Barnet in April and Tewkesbury in May. Warwick, Henry's heir Edward of Westminster and other senior Lancastrians were killed, while Henry died in the Tower of London a few days later. England remained relatively peaceful until Edward's death in 1483. His two minor sons, Edward and Richard were subsequently declared illegitimate by his younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, who became Richard III.\nDocument[4](Title: Edward VIII) Edward was born on 23 June 1894 at White Lodge, Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria.

Born about 1320, Edward was the only son of Thomas of Brotherton, eldest son of King Edward I by his second marriage to Margaret of France( 1279? \u2013 1318), the daughter of King Philippe III of France( d.1285). His mother was Alice Hales( d. in or before 1330), daughter of Sir Roger Hales of Hales Hall in Loddon in Roughton, Norfolk, by his wife Alice. He had two sisters: Shortly after 29 May 1328, at Hereford, Edward of Norfolk married Beatrice de Mortimer, daughter of Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, by Joan de Joinville( d.1356), daughter and coheiress of Sir Peter de Joinville. The occasion was a double wedding at which the bride's sister, Agnes Mortimer, married Laurence Hastings, later 1st Earl of Pembroke. The celebrations were accompanied by a magnificent tournament, and were attended by Edward III and his mother, Isabella of France, who was by then the mistress of the bride's father, Roger de Mortimer. There was no issue of the marriage, and two years after the ceremony Roger de Mortimer was hanged at Tyburn as a common criminal. Edward of Norfolk died before 9 August 1334, predeceasing his father. His widow married, before 13 September 1337, Sir Thomas de Brewes( d. 9 or 16 June 1361), son and heir of Sir Peter de Brewes of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and his wife Agnes de Clifford, by whom she had three sons and three daughters. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton about 20 September 1338, Edward of Norfolk's elder sister, Margaret, succeeded to the earldom of Norfolk.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Edward I Of England?": [

It was shot mostly at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of $800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of urban sprawl to give the film an apocalyptic feel.

Billed as\" A Heterosexual Movie by Gregg Araki The Doom Generation\" is the second film in the director's trilogy known as the\" Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy\", the first being\" Totally Fucked Up\"( 1993) and the last one\" Nowhere\"( 1997). The characters of Amy Blue and Jordan White are based on the Mark Beyer comic strip\" Amy and Jordan\". \" The Doom Generation\" was Araki's major film debut. It was shot mostly at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of$ 800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of urban sprawl to give the film an apocalyptic feel. The reasonable budget allowed Araki to hire professional crew, making it the first of his films not shot by himself. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 1995, before appearing at various other film festivals. It received mixed reviews from critics. During the press screening, many of the critics walked out. However, at the San Francisco International Film Festival( SFIFF), the film received critical acclaim, most proclaiming it as Araki's breakthrough film. Distributed by Trimark Pictures, it was released in the United States on October 27, 1995. Despite the favorable reviews, the film did not achieve financial success, earning only$ 284,785 at the box office.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \"Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film, \"The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's \"Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\" (1925). \"The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, \"Wara Wara\" (1930) and \"Hacia la Gloria\" (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and \"Wara Wara\" remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\".

He belonged to the Bagrationi dynasty and directly descended from the Kings of Imereti. Michael Imeretinsky was born to a Georgian father, \"Serene Prince\" George Imeretinsky (1872\u20131932), and a Russian mother, Lidya Nikolayevna Klimova (1880\u20131956), in St. Petersburg.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Ernst Kirchweger) Ernst Kirchweger( January 12, 1898 \u2013 April 2, 1965 in Vienna) was the first person to die as a result of political conflict in Austria's Second Republic. From 1916 to 1918, Ernst Kirchweger participated in World War I as a sailor in the Austro- Hungarian Navy. Afterwards, he fought on the side of the Red Army. Until 1934, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, but then he joined the Communists, which was outlawed at that time. During the reigns of the Fatherland Front and National Socialist German Workers Party, he risked his life as an activist in illegal trade unions. After Austria's liberation in 1945, having survived concentration camp, he continued to speak out against Fascism and National Socialism. On March 31, 1965, a demonstration of students, former resistance fighters and unions against Taras Borodajkewycz, a university professor accused of having made anti-Semitic statements, took place in Vienna, while the student organisation of the Freedom Party of Austria organized a riot. There were skirmishes between the participants of the two demonstrations; during one in which Kichweger was attacked by G\u00fcnther K\u00fcmel and severely injured. He died three days later, aged 67, as a result of his injuries. K\u00fcmel was sentenced to ten months in prison. 25,000 people attended Kirchweger's funeral. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering; his ashes are now buried in Hietzing Cemetery in Vienna. In 1990, the\" Wielandschule\" in Vienna- Favoriten, a building owned by the Communist Party, was seized by left- wing activists and named Ernst- Kirchweger- Haus. The building has been sold by the Communist Party since.\nDocument[2](Title: Pneumonia) Edwin Klebs was the first to observe bacteria in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875. Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was performed by Carl Friedl\u00e4nder and Albert Fraenkel in 1882 and 1884, respectively. Friedl\u00e4nder's initial work introduced the Gram stain, a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. Christian Gram's paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.Sir William Osler, known as \"the father of modern medicine\", appreciated the death and disability caused by pneumonia, describing it as the \"captain of the men of death\" in 1918, as it had overtaken tuberculosis as one of the leading causes of death in this time. This phrase was originally coined by John Bunyan in reference to \"consumption\" (tuberculosis). Osler also described pneumonia as \"the old man's friend\" as death was often quick and painless when there were much slower and more painful ways to die.Several developments in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia. With the advent of penicillin and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world. Vaccination of infants against Haemophilus influenzae type B began in 1988 and led to a dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline.\nDocument[3](Title: Hermann Friedrich Graebe) Herman Friedrich Graebe or Gr\u00e4be,( June 19, 1900 \u2013 April 17, 1986) was a German manager and engineer in charge of a German building firm in Ukraine, who witnessed mass executions of the Jews of Dubno on October 5, 1942 by Nazis. Following the war he wrote a famous and horrifying testimony. Graebe gave the following eyewitness account: My foreman and I went directly to the pits. Nobody bothered us. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had got off the trucks- men, women and children of all ages- had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under -linen and clothing. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about eight persons, a man and a woman both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty- four, and two grown- up daughters about twenty- eight or twenty- nine. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one- year- old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family I have just mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said,\" twenty- three years old.\" I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was nearly two- thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy- gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them. Blood was running from their necks. The next batch was approaching already. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot. He later provided vital testimony in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, invoking bitter persecution from many of his countrymen. To escape the hostility, Graebe moved his family to San Francisco in 1948, where he lived until his death in 1986. Hermann Graebe was honoured as a' Righteous Among the Nations' by Yad Vashem. Another witness of the mass executions of October 1942 in Dubno was the German officer Axel von dem Bussche who, traumatised by what he had seen, in 1943 joined the German resistance around Claus von Stauffenberg and unsuccessfully tried to kill Adolf Hitler in a suicide attack in November 1943.\nDocument[4](Title: Guillaume Schnaebel\u00e9) Guillaume Schnaebel\u00e9 or Wilhelm Schn\u00e4bele ( 1831 \u2013 5 December 1900) was a French official from Alsace, best known for being arrested by Germans in the April 1887 Schnaebele incident( or Affair) which nearly led to war between France and Germany. Who caused the incident and why remains speculative, but it has been suggested German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was its instigator, for a number of possible motivations \u2013 baiting France into starting a war; or, gauging the extent of French support for Boulangism; or creating a strained situation with France to force the renewal of a Russian- German alliance of neutrality that was under debate at the Russian court. Others see it as simply a series of unintended consequences, notable for the role played by France's General Georges Ernest Boulanger. This and a number of other incidents involving General Boulanger are elements of what is known as the Boulanger Affair, a series of embarrassments for the newly formed government of the French Third Republic that some consider to have nearly led to a coup d'\u00e9tat.\nDocument[5](Title: Louis I, Grand Duke of Baden) Ludwig I (9 February 1763 \u2013 30 March 1830) succeeded as Grand Duke of Baden on 8 December 1818. He was the uncle of his predecessor Karl Ludwig Friedrich, and his death marked the end of the Z\u00e4hringen line of the House of Baden. He was succeeded by his half brother, Leopold. He secured the continued existence of the University of Freiburg in 1820, after which the University was called the Albert-Ludwig University. He also founded the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe in 1825. The Hochschule is the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwig's death in 1830 led to many rumors. His death also meant the extinction of his line of the Baden family. The succession then went to the children of the morganatic second marriage of Grand Duke Karl Friedrich and Louise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, who was created Countess of Hochberg in the Austrian nobility at the personal request of Karl Friedrich. After Ludwig's death, there was much discussion about a mysterious seventeen-year-old man named Kaspar Hauser, who had appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 1828. Seventeen years previously, the first son of the future Grand Duke Karl and his French wife St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais died under what were later portrayed as mysterious circumstances. There was at the time and still is today (in 2007) speculation that Hauser, who died (perhaps murdered) in 1833, was that child. Working together with architect Friedrich Weinbrenner, Louis is responsible for most of the classical revival buildings in the city center and for building the pyramid.\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Louis-Ren\u00e9 De Caradeuc De La Chalotais or Hermann Friedrich Graebe?": [

They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived \u2014 he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773\u20131778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).\nDocument[2](Title: James Adam (classicist)) James Adam( 1860\u20131907) was a Scottish classicist who taught Classics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.\nDocument[3](Title: John Adam (architect)) John Adam( 5 March 1721 \u2013 25 June 1792) was a Scottish architect.\nDocument[4](Title: Robert Adam) Robert Adam (3 July 1728 \u2013 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689\u20131748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the \"Adam Style\", and his theory of \"movement\" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses.

Born to Owen Tudor and the dowager queen Catherine of Valois, Edmund was half-brother to Henry VI of England. Edmund was raised for several years by Katherine de la Pole, and Henry took an interest in Edmund's upbringing, granting him a title and lands once he came of age. Both Edmund and his brother, Jasper, were made advisers to the King as they were his remaining blood relatives. The brothers were made the senior earls in the royal court and had influential positions in the Parliament of England. Edmund was also granted Baynard's Castle, London and ran a successful estate. He was married to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, after her first marriage was annulled. Prior to the start of the Wars of the Roses, Edmund liaised with Richard of York and supported him when the King fell ill during 1453 and 1454. After war began in 1455, York sent Edmund to uphold the authority of the King in South Wales.

However, the film was panned by critics and became a box office bomb. Some of the criticisms included stylistic anachronisms, such as the mini-skirt and decidedly 1980s music from the likes of The Style Council and Sade, the bowdlerisation of Kensit's character (Crepe Suzette had been depicted as a promiscuous \"negrophile\" in the book), and the casting of Bowie, who made it a condition of his musical contribution.

Although a controversial figure within the music industry, XXXTentacion has been regarded to have left behind \"a huge musical footprint\" due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his short career. He was often credited by critics and fans for his musical-versatility, with his music primarily exploring trap, R&B, rock and emo. Born in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, where he soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. XXXTentacion rose to mainstream fame with the single \"Look at Me\". His debut album, \"17\" (2017), debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 and his second album,  (2018), debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. Both albums have been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

On June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion was fatally shot at the age of 20, in a robbery at a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida.

The show consisted of 17 young women competing for an internship at and a college scholarship. Atoosa Rubenstein was the main judge, she was the youngest editor-in-chief ever to run \"Seventeen magazine\". They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice \u2014 they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition. The winner would get her face on the cover of \"Seventeen magazine\", a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly \u2014 Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons \u2014 video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest. The way the girls would generally find out who was eliminated was by sitting around a TV as Atoosa would talk to them, telling them the results of the tasks they were given. The TV screen would then display the names of the girls who would be staying in the house, written in cursive form. The girl whose name didn't appear on 'The List' was eliminated, and met with Atoosa to hear her reasoning for why she was eliminated. In the final episode, Jennifer Steele was declared the winner, with her magazine cover unveiled in Times Square. It was also revealed that Brianne Burrowes, who voluntarily left the show in an early episode of the series, was offered a job by Atoosa and will be working with Jennifer in their respective internships at the magazine.\nDocument[2](Title: Miss Teen USA 1984) Miss Teen USA 1984, the second Miss Teen USA pageant, was televised live from Memphis Cook Convention Center, Memphis, Tennessee on 3 April 1984.

Rider Haggard, and is the son of the actor, poet and novelist Stephen Haggard who died in 1943. Haggard is married to stained glass artist Anna Sklovsky, with whom he has two children, the actress Daisy Haggard, and William Haggard who is an architect. He has four children by his first marriage, Sarah, Claire, Rachel and Philip. Haggard began his career as an assistant director at the Royal Court in 1960, then directed at Dundee Rep and Glasgow Citizens before joining the first National Theatre company in 1963 where he co-directed (John Dexter and Bill Gaskill) and assisted Laurence Olivier and Franco Zeffirelli.

Gilles Carle, who was a key figure in the development of a commercial Qu\u00e9bec cinema, worked as a graphic artist and writer before he joined the National Film Board of Canada in 1960. His innovative debut feature, \"La Vie heureuse de L\u00e9opold Z.\", tracked the adventures of a snowplough operator during a madcap Christmas Eve. But after the NFB rejected several of his projects, he began working independently. In 1971 Carle joined forces with Pierre Lamy to form Les Productions Carle-Lamy, which produced Claude Jutra\u2019s epic \"Kamouraska\", Denys Arcand\u2019s early features and all his early films. The quirkily paced, proto-feminist \"La Vraie Nature de Bernadette\" \u2013 widely regarded as his best film \u2013 and \"Le Mort d\u2019un b\u00fbcheron\" eventually led to the more mainstream but graceful \"Les Plouffe\" and the epic love story \"Maria Chapdelaine\", both classics of Quebec cinema. In 1972 Carle won the Canadian Film Award for best Director for his \"The True Nature of Bernadette\". Carle was born in Maniwaki, Quebec. His film \"50 ans\", celebrating the \"50 years\" of the National Film Board of Canada, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. In 1990, he was awarded the Government of Quebec's Prix Albert-Tessier. In 1997, Carle received a Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts. In 1998, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2007, he was made a Grand Officer of the Ordre National du Quebec. Carle died aged 81 on November 28, 2009 of complications from Parkinson's disease at the hospital in Granby, Quebec. He is survived by his son and three daughters as well as his companion of 27 years, Chlo\u00e9 Sainte-Marie.

The movie is a sequel to Lang's silent film\" Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\"( 1922) and features many cast and crew members from Lang's previous films. The film features Rudolf Klein- Rogge as Dr. Mabuse who is in an insane asylum where he is found frantically writing his crime plans. When Mabuse's criminal plans begin to be implemented, Inspector Lohmann( played by Otto Wernicke) tries to find the solution with clues from gangster Thomas Kent( Gustav Diessl), the institutionalized Hofmeister( Karl Meixner) and Professor Baum( Oscar Beregi Sr.) who becomes obsessed with Dr. Mabuse. \" The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" was based on elements of author Norbert Jacques' unfinished novel\" Mabuse's Colony\". It was Lang's second sound film for Nero- Film and was his final collaboration with his wife and screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film to a foreign market, a French- language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title\" Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse\". According to Siegfried Kracauer, Lang deliberately intended the film to suggest the Mabuse- like qualities of Adolf Hitler, who was on his rise to become Chancellor of Germany while the film was being written. When Hitler came to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda and banned the film in Germany, suggesting that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French- language and German- language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release. The sequel\" The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse\"( 1960) was also directed by Lang. Modern reception of the film is favorable with critics, while the film has influenced filmmakers including Claude Chabrol and Artur Brauner.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died later, Emanuelle And The Last Cannibals or Hostile Country?": [

In Australia, Kate Bush devised the dance routine for the song in her Melbourne hotel room, and performed the song on the television show, Countdown. The song references Hammer Films, a company specializing in horror movies. However, Bush conceived of the song after viewing the film \"Man of a Thousand Faces\", a biographical film about Lon Chaney starring James Cagney. \"The song was inspired by seeing James Cagney playing the part of Lon Chaney playing the hunchback,\" Bush stated in 1979. \"He was an actor in an actor in an actor, rather like Chinese boxes, and that's what I was trying to create. \" The story of the song concerns an actor who gets thrust into the lead role of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" after the original actor dies in an accident on the film set. The guilt-ridden narrator of the song ends up being haunted by the ghost of the jealous original actor, who was a former friend. A promotional video was made for the single featuring Bush and a black-masked dancer performing the song against a black background.

He was the son of John I of Avesnes and Adelaide of Holland. From his father he received the stadholdership (government) of Zeeland. After he left Zeeland, he took up service with Charles II of Naples, who made him constable of the Kingdom of Naples. After his marriage with Isabella (16 September 1289), he had one daughter: Matilda. She would succeed him and her mother as princess. Florent settled with his wife in Morea. He negotiated the Treaty of Glarentsa with the Byzantine Empire in 1290. The situation for the Franks in Greece was hopeless by this time, however. The fall of the Angevins in Sicily meant that they were preoccupied with recouping territory there and few Western governments would send troops to defend Morea. Florent thus made peace and maintained it until 1293, when the Greeks retook Kalamata. Florent did not despair and did not reopen the war which had been ongoing until his succession: he instead sent an embassy in protest to Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the emperor returned Kalamata. In 1296, the Greeks retook the castle of Saint George in Arcadia. Florent besieged the castle, but died before it could be taken.\nDocument[2](Title: Richilde, Countess of Hainaut) Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut( \u2013 15 March 1086), was a ruling countess of Hainaut from c. 1050 until 1076, in co-regency with her husband Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders and son Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut.

She was the daughter of Isabella of Villehardouin and her husband Florent of Hainaut. In 1299, while still a child, she had been married to Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens. Widowed in 1308, she was engaged to Charles of Taranto until 1313, when she remarried to Louis of Burgundy, who held the titular dignity of the long- extinct Kingdom of Thessalonica. The marriage was intended to unite the Angevin and Burgundian houses. So was the betrothal of the Empress Catherine II to Hugh V of Burgundy, Louis's elder brother. However, Charles of Valois, Catherine's father, nixed the marriage and instead married her to Philip of Taranto. It was in an effort to compensate the Burgundians that Philip renounced his claim to Achaea in favour of Matilda and gave her hand to Louis. From 1307, when Philip of Savoy relinquished his claim, to 1312, when Isabella of Villehardouin died, Achaea was disputed between two claimants: Isabella and Philip I of Taranto. In 1313, Philip granted it to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and her first husband Florent of Hainaut. On Isabella's death, however, Ferdinand of Majorca laid claim to the principality in right of his wife, Isabella of Sabran, the daughter of Isabella's younger sister Margaret of Villehardouin. The new couple quickly left for Greece to take possession of their fief, which was then occupied by their rival Ferdinand. At the Battle of Manolada on 5 July 1316, Ferdinand was vanquished and killed and Louis took control of the Elis. However, he was poisoned soon after, leaving a twice- widowed 23- year- old in charge of the Morea. It was soon disputed by the varying claimants and Matilda was solidly dispossessed of her fief by 1318, in which year John, Duke of Durazzo, an Angevin, abducted the princess and forced her to marry him. She did not give him children, however, and he repudiated her in 1321. Matilda married yet again to Hugh de La Palice and retired to Aversa, where she died in 1331.\nDocument[4](Title: Herman, Count of Hainaut) Herman (died 3 July 1049), Count of Mons and Hainaut, son of Reginar V, Count of Mons, and Mathilde of Verdun, daughter of Herman, Count of Verdun. As the Count of Mons, a title inherited from his father, he allied with Godfrey the Bearded, Duke of Lorraine, and Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, against Emperor Henry III. This won the countship of Valenciennes, completing the reconstruction of Hainaut. His wife, who preferred an alliance with the emperor, attempted to get Herman to imprison Wazo, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, but he refused. In 1040, Herman married Richilde, whose origins are uncertain. Herman and Richilde had two children:\nAfter the death of Herman, Richilde married the son of Baldwin V, who arranged for Herman's children to be disinherited. Richilde's new husband, Baldwin VI the Good, became Herman's successor and count of a unified Hainaut/Flanders.

For live performances, Van Pelt is accompanied on- stage by fellow Think About Life bandmate Greg Napier.\nDocument[2](Title: Mister Kingdom) \"Mister Kingdom\" is a symphonic rock song written by the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). The song first appeared as the opening track of side 2, track number 6 from their 1974 album, \"Eldorado\". It was the B-side to the 1977 hit, \"Turn to Stone\", found on their album, \"Out of the Blue\". On the single version the solo slowly fades from 5:05 all the way to the very end, 5:29. But on the \"Flashback\" boxset, the solo fades about 16 seconds earlier than the LP version, also cutting the small orchestra intro. Some will find that the song has a similar style to The Beatles' song \"Across the Universe\". The song features an extended orchestral playout starting from 4:16 to 5:29 transiting into \"Nobody's Child\". This guy's always looking for a pot of gold.

The album contained multi-genred songs, being very far from the early punkier stuff, like in the case of 7\" single \"Stuck with You\". Jim Green in Trousser Press distinguished or tried to define it as \"pop? Hard stuff? Commercial new wave? Reggae-pop?\". Although the album has new wave sounds, it was unsuccessful at the time of its release. Shortly afterwards, Zones released a 7\" single called \"Mourning Star\", whose eponymous song (a shorter version of the album song) was backed with \"Under Influence\", which did not appear in the album, despite the name being the same. At the end of 1979, and after years of failures, the group split up.\nDocument[4](Title: Katrina and the Waves 2) Katrina& the Waves 2 is the second album by new wave band Katrina and the Waves, released in 1984( see 1984 in music).\nDocument[5](Title: Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)) Arthur( Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) is the seventh studio album by English rock band the Kinks, released in October 1969. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; the television programme was never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet- layer, who was based on Ray and guitarist Dave Davies' brother- in- law Arthur Anning. A mono version was released in the UK, but not in the US. It is now available on the 2011 deluxe edition re-issue. \" Arthur\" was met with nearly unanimous acclaim upon release. It received generous coverage in the US rock press, with articles running in underground magazines such as\" Fusion\" and\" The Village Voice\". It garnered back- to- back reviews by Mike Daly and Greil Marcus in\" Rolling Stone\" magazine's lead section; Daly rated it\" the Kinks' finest hour\", and Marcus ranked it\" the best British album of 1969\". In the UK,\" Arthur\" received a mixed review in\" New Musical Express Disc& Music Echo\" praised the album's musical integrity, and\" Melody Maker\" called it\" Ray Davies' finest hour ... beautifully British to the core.\" The album, although not very successful commercially, was a return to the US charts for the band. Their previous album,\" The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society\", received acclaim from critics but failed to chart in any country upon its 1968 release, with total US sales estimated at under 25,000 copies. The Kinks returned to the\" Billboard\" charts in 1969 after a two- year absence, with\" Arthur\" s lead single,\" Victoria\", peaking at number 62. The album reached number 50 on the\" Record World\" charts, and number 105 on the\" Billboard\" album chart, their highest position since 1965. It failed to chart in Britain. \" Arthur\" paved the way for the further success of their 1970 comeback album\" Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One\" and its accompanying US Top 10 and UK Top 5 hit\" Lola\".\n\nQuestion: Which album came out earlier, Was I The Wave? or Kingdom Of Rock?": [

It was released as the main promotional track from her 9th album, \"Past<Future\", in November 2009. Amuro finds the song indicative of her sound on \"Past<Future\". The album puts more emphasis on songs with \"bright melodies/coolness,\" instead of the R&B/hip-hop beats of \"Play\" and previous albums.\nDocument[2](Title: Namie Amuro) Born in Naha, Okinawa, Japan, Amuro debuted as the lead singer of the idol group Super Monkey's when she was 14 years old. Despite early sales disappointments, she ventured into modeling and acting, attracting domestic attention with the group's best-selling single \"Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)\". She signed to Avex Trax in 1995 and debuted as a solo artist with the single \"Body Feels Exit\". Her 1996 studio album, \"Sweet 19 Blues,\" sold over 3 million copies, setting the record at the time for the biggest selling album by a female artist in Japan and the highest selling album debut in the world (currently ranked #15 in the world's largest first week album sales). One of the singles from her album \"Concentration 20\" (1997), \"Can You Celebrate?\", is the best-selling single by a solo female artist in Japanese music history. From 1999, Amuro partnered with international musicians and producers on her records, beginning with \"Genius 2000\" (2000). In the early 2000s, Amuro's music evolved from pop to R&B, and Amuro saw a decline in sales. \"Play\" (2007), her eighth studio album, heralded a period of commercial resurgence. She continued to experiment musically, moving to electronic dance music and English language songs with follow-up records \"Uncontrolled\" (2012) and \"Feel\" (2013). She subsequently released her eleventh studio album, \"Genic\" (2015) and a compilation album, \"Finally\" (2017). Amuro is noted within the Japanese entertainment industry, and the wider Western music industry, for \"producing\" and managing her own career. Aside from music, she has appeared in various advertisement campaigns in Japan and founded her own management company, Stella88, and her own record label, Dimension Point. Having sold more than 36 million records in Japan, Amuro is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Japan by Oricon. Since her solo debut, she has top 10 singles for 23 consecutive years (#1 for solo artist). All of her albums are at least certified Platinum, and her debut solo album, \"Sweet 19 Blues\", was the best selling album in Japan. She is the only artist in Japan selling million albums in her teens, 20s, 30s and 40s. Furthermore, her last album, \"Finally\", topped the Year-End album charts of both Oricon and Billboard Japan for two consecutive years (The first and only artist in the Japanese Music Industry to do so). Amuro has frequently been noted for her live performances at music award ceremonies and she is the recipient of World Music Awards, Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards Japan among many others.

The record was important because it introduced automobile racing into popular music and underscored the car's relevance to American culture, particularly youth culture. Shibley was born in Van Buren, Arkansas. After relocating he acquired the nickname\" Arkie\" and, around 1948, began hosting a regular country music show on radio station KBRG in Bremerton, Washington. Although the writing credit for\" Hot Rod Race\" is given to George Wilson, this may be Shibley's pseudonym. He offered the song to 4 Star Records in Los Angeles, but was turned down, and Shibley decided to release the song on his own Mountain Dew label. The record was credited to\" Arkie Shibley and his Mountain Dew Boys\", the line- up being Shibley on rhythm guitar, Leon Kelley on lead guitar, Jackie Hayes on bass and banjo, and Phil Fregon on fiddle. The record became popular and was reissued on 4 Star's Gilt Edge imprint. Shibley's record raced into the country charts in January 1951, peaking at# 5, with cover versions on major labels by Ramblin' Jimmie Dolan on Capitol, Red Foley on Decca and Tiny Hill on Mercury. The Hill version also crossed over to the pop charts(# 29). In 1951 Shibley recorded four sequels to his hit, all performed in a Woody Guthrie- like talking blues style:\" Hot Rod Race# 2 Arkie Meets the Judge( Hot Rod Race# 3) The Guy in the Mercury( Hot Rod Race# 4)\" and\" The Kid in the Model A( Hot Rod Race# 5)\". He subsequently disappeared into obscurity. He died in Van Buren, Arkansas, in 1975. \" Hot Rod Race\" prompted the even more successful answer song\" Hot Rod Lincoln\", a hit for Charlie Ryan( recorded 1955 and 1959, charted 1960,# 33 pop), Johnny Bond( 1960,# 26 pop) and Commander Cody( 1972,# 9 pop). Shibley's record also directly influenced Chuck Berry's\" Maybellene\", Gene Vincent's\" Race With The Devil\", and the succession of hot rod records by the Beach Boys and others in the early 1960s.\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song Fast Car (Namie Amuro Song) born?": [

His most important volume of poetry,\" Der Aufbruch\", which appeared during 1914, is regarded as a major work of early Expressionism.

He ended the war as SS and Police Leader( SSPF) of Adria- West, Northern Italy. He escaped investigation after the war and is reported to have died when his car overturned on a road outside Dortmund, in August 1953. There were no witnesses to the accident. The police chief at the time of the discovery and identification of the corpse, had served under von Alvensleben in Southern Russia, during the war. Ludolf\" Ludi\" Jakob von Alvensleben was the third of four sons born to of Wittenmoor, Stendal, Saxony- Anhalt in Germany. His oldest brother, Busso died in 1918, in the First World War. His remaining older brother was the art historian and diarist. His younger brother Wichard von Alvensleben has entered history as being involved in the rescue of a large number of prominent hostages in Tirol in the last days of the Second World War. Like his two older brothers, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben attended school at the Knights Academy in Brandenburg on the Havel until he volunteered for service in the First World War. After returning from the war as a 19- year- old Lieutenant, he was active in a Freikorps company, before taking over the family estate in Plutowo/ Thorn( Polish; Torun) in West Prussia. This was given as an inheritance from his father. As a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben became one of a large number of Junker members who lost their lands to the Polish state. He was compensated by the new German government. However, he lost this compensation in the hyperinflation that was rampant in Germany in the early 1920s. He was also involved in an unsuccessful Ford auto franchise in the then West- Prussian city of Danzig( Polish; Gda\u0144sk). Financially ruined, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben returned to Saxony- Anhalt and in June 1932, became an early member of the SS and Adjutant to the SA Gruppenf\u00fchrer and later Reichssportf\u00fchrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten. He rose rapidly through the ranks. By September 1939 and the invasion of Poland, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben had become Standartenf\u00fchrer. His familial connections to Reichsf\u00fchrer Heinrich Himmler's Personal Adjutant, Ludolf Hermann von Alvensleben enabled Standartenf\u00fchrer von Alvensleben to be assigned as Inspektionsf\u00fchrer for the ethnic paramilitary Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz in West Prussia. He established his headquarters on his dispossessed estate in Plutowo/ Thorn( Polish; Torun) and exacted revenge. The cellars of the estate house became the scene for torture and murder of hundreds of Poles and Jews. He reported directly to his namesake and Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz commander Oberf\u00fchrer Ludolf Hermann von Alvensleben. The identical name, shared fanaticism and areas of murderous activity, has resulted in the identities of both men being confounded by historians. By the end of October 1939, many of the younger members of the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz in Danzig- West Prussia were incorporated into the Police, SS/ SD or Wehrmacht. The Reichsdeutsche Officers were given new duties as ethnic cleansers with the Reichskommisar fur die Festigung des Deutschen Volkstums( RKFDV) and its affiliate organizations. Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben was sent to Lublin to serve under the SS and Police Leader in Lublin, Oberf\u00fchrer Odilo Globocnik. His responsibilities included the organization and training of the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz in and around Lublin. He was later involved in the training of both the Sonderdienst and the Trawniki guards. In February 1940 he also became head of the Lublin- Lipowa camp. Between October 1939 and the Spring and the summer of 1940, von Alvensleben made use of his Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz auxiliaries to play a significant part in the massacre of the Polish intelligentsia in West- Prussia and later between Lublin and Warsaw. This became known as the AB- Aktion. In April 1940, von Alvensleben commanded the Selbstschutz during the massacre of more than 160 Polish civilians at Jozefow in the Lublin district. In June 1940, a further massacre of 27 civilians was carried out at Radawiec under his orders.\n\nQuestion: Who died later, Stephen De Staebler or Samuel Arthur Saunder?": [

The album was one of many produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between October and December 1983, the album was Yankovic's follow- up to his modestly successful debut LP, Weird Al\" Yankovic\". The album is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies of artists like Michael Jackson, Men Without Hats, the Greg Kihn Band, the Police, and Survivor. The other half of the album contains many\" style parodies\", musical imitations that come close to, but do not directly copy a specific work by, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of artists like Bob Marley and the B- 52s. This album marked a musical departure from Yankovic's self- titled debut, in that the arrangements of the parodies were now closer to the originals. Also, the accordion was no longer used in every song, but only where deemed appropriate or comically inappropriate. The album is also notable for being the first album released by Yankovic to include a polka medley of hit songs. These pastiches of hit songs, set to polka music, have since appeared on nearly all of Yankovic's albums. Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3- D\" was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the\" Billboard\" 200 and number sixty- one in Australia.

The album also produced two minor US hits,\" King of Suede\", which peaked at number sixty- two, and\" I Lost on Jeopardy\", which peaked at number eighty- one.

Koniecpolski's life was one of almost constant warfare. Before he had reached the age of 20, he had fought in the Dymitriads and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Later, in 1620, he took part in the Battle of Cecora, during which he was captured by Ottoman forces. After his release in 1623, he defeated the Ottomans' Tatar vassals several times between 1624 and 1626. With inferior numbers, during the Polish\u2013Swedish War (1626\u201329), Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski), in modern Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmat\u00f3w brought him international fame and recognition.\n\nQuestion: Which country Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620\u20131659)'s father is from?": [

His father Hamelin granted him the manor of Appleby, North Lincolnshire. De Warenne was present at the coronation of John, King of England on 27 May 1199. When Normandy was lost to the French in 1204 he lost his Norman holdings( in 1202 he was lieutenant of Gascony), but John recompensed him with Grantham and Stamford. His first tenure of office as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports began in 1204, and lasted until 1206; he was again appointed as Warden in 1214. He was also a Warden of the Welsh Marches between 1208 and 1213. Between the years 1200 and 1208, and between 1217 and 1226 he was to serve as the High Sheriff of Surrey. William was one of the few barons who remained loyal to King John( who was his cousin. In 1212, when a general rebellion was feared, John committed to him the custody of the northern shires. During the king's difficulties with the barons, when they sought for the French prince to assume the English throne, William is listed as one of those who advised John to accede to\" Magna Carta\". His allegiance only faltered a few times when the king's cause looked hopeless; shortly before the death of John, he made terms with Prince Louis. In March 1217 he again demonstrated his loyalty to England by supporting the young King Henry III, and he was also responsible for the establishment of Salisbury Cathedral. However, he disliked the royal favourites who came into power after 1227, and used his influence to protect Hubert de Burgh when the latter had been removed from office by their efforts in 1232. Warenne's relations with the king became strained in course of time. In 1238 he was evidently regarded as a leader of the baronial opposition, for the Great Council appointed him as one of the treasurers who were to prevent the king from squandering the subsidy voted in that year. William married Maud Marshal, on 13 October 1225. They had a son and a daughter. The son John( 1231\u20131304) succeeded his father as earl, while the daughter, Isabel de Warenne( c. 1228\u20131282), married Hugh d' Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel.

It was written by James Horner and Kuk Harrell, with production done by Simon Franglen. A pop inspired ballad, the lyrics, which reflect the story line of the film, are about love, emotion and power. The song received multiple comparisons to Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\", which is the official theme song written by Horner for another film directed by Cameron, \"Titanic\" (1997). Lewis has performed the song on \" So You Think You Can Dance\" and \"Today\", and it was included on the set list of her debut concert tour, The Labyrinth (2010).

It was written by songwriter Diane Warren and composer James Newton Howard to promote Walt Disney Pictures' 41st animated feature film  (2001). Produced by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair, the song was released as the only promotional single from the film's on June 5, 2001. Directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale agreed that \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\", their third animated Disney project, would not be a musical. However, the studio's marketing department insisted that at least one song be featured during the film's end credits in order to adhere to tradition. Disney hired M\u00fda to record a pop song for the \"Atlantis\" soundtrack because of the studio and singer's shared business relationship with A&M/ Interscope Records. A downtempo pop and R&B ballad, \"Where the Dream Takes You\" is an inspirational song about following one's heart and self-discovery, which alludes to the film's central plot about a young adventurer's search for the lost city of Atlantis. Both Warren and Howard collaborated on the song's melody, which borrows from Howard's own orchestral score, while Warren wrote the lyrics. \"Where the Dream Takes You\" is the only song from \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" that features both music and lyrics. Upon its release 10 days ahead of the film, the ballad was criticized for sounding generic and uninspired. Some critics also questioned Disney's decision to have M\u00fda to record the song, believing the single would have benefited from a more experienced vocalist. However, the song was nominated for Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film at the World Soundtrack Awards.\nDocument[3](Title: I'll Be Seeing You (Jo Stafford album)) I'll Be Seeing You is a 1959 studio album by Jo Stafford.

The title of the 1944 film \"I'll Be Seeing You\" was taken from this song at the suggestion of the film's producer, Dore Schary. The song is included in the film's soundtrack. The resemblance between the main tune's first four lines and a passage within the theme of the last movement of Gustav Mahler's Third Symphony (1896) was pointed out by Deryck Cooke in 1970. Mahler may have derived this passage from the overture to Daniel Auber's comic opera (Marco Spada (1852).

He was born in Serowe and got his education in Tiger Kloof, Lovedale and Fort Hare University. A prolific author, he had his first book, a biography of Khama III, accepted for publication while still in high school at Lovedale. This book was later quashed by the Bechuanaland Protectorate authorities and was not published. He was banished from the Bangwato Reserve in 1937 after Tshekedi Khama, the Bangwato regent accused Raditladi of adultery with his wife as well as for conspiring to bewitch him. After that Raditladi served as a colonial service clerk and quickly became the highest ranking Motswana in the Protectorate. Following his experiences with Tshekedi, Raditladi wrote his historical drama Motswasele II, his most famous work. The major theme of this work is with royal despotism and the perverted results of such tyranny. In 1944 the Batawana Kgosi Moremi III asked the British to appoint Raditladi as the head of the Tsetse Fly Control agency in Ngamiland. As such he became the first Motswana to head a government department. Two years later, Moremi appointed him Tribal Secretary. This appointment occurred just before Moremi's death, following which the chief was succeeded by his wife, the regent EP Moremi. Raditladi and the Regent, both foreign- born, exercised tight control over Ngamiland and quickly aroused resentment. Their clandestine love affair also become public knowledge. In late 1950 the Regent was forced to abort Raditladi's child, an event that led Raditladi's opponents to drive him out of Ngamiland at gunpoint. During the 1940s Raditladi was instrumental in establishing the sport of soccer in Botswana, and was behind the formation of leagues in both the northern and southern parts of the country. In 1958 after his return to Serowe Raditladi founded the Bechuanaland Protectorate Federal Party. Raditladi had for years been writing political newspaper columns under the pseudonym\" Observer\", but his journalistic abilities did not translate into successful politics. After his party was eclipsed by other nationalist movements he moved to the sidelines and played a minimal role in the run up to independence in 1966. Raditladi wrote several historical plays, love stories and poems. In 2008 a large impact crater on Mercury was named Raditladi after him.\nDocument[3](Title: Jhaverchand Meghani) Jhaverchand or Zaverchand Kalidas Meghani was a noted poet, writer, social reformer and freedom fighter from Gujarat.

Her father Salomon (Simeon) Kliatchkin (1858\u20131916) was the owner of the first credit bureau (credit reference agency) in the Russian Empire. Her mother was Helena Kliatchkin (n\u00e9e Bajenov; 1886\u20131953). She had nine siblings; one died in childhood, three in Joseph Stalin's purges, one survived in Russia and four survived in exile in France. The family's suffering under Stalin are recorded in a film shown on Russian television in 2008, \"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0430The history of a family which was a witness to its epoch\"). She studied medicine in Paris before 1914. At this time she was married to her first husband, , a lawyer. Berenson was the defender in the Tsarist courts of Felix Dzerzhinsky, who was to be the founder of the Cheka, the first Soviet secret police agency. At the outbreak of the First World War she volunteered to work as a nurse at the Hotel Continental in Paris, now the Westin Paris - Vend\u00f4me. She nursed Pierre Laurent (1892-1935), a young French officer, the son of Charles Laurent, a French senior civil servant. Pierre was sent to join the military mission of General Lavergne in Saint Petersburg, then called Petrograd. Lavergne had succeeded General Henri Niessel as head of the French military mission. There Pierre was responsible for obtaining information about the Russian army. Bronis\u0142awa, back in Petrograd, helped him. After Vladimir Lenin arrived in his sealed train their priority was to prevent him leading Russia into an armistice with Germany. They were able to obtain telegrams to Lenin appearing to show that he was supported by German funds. They presented this information to the Provisional government headed by Prince Georgy Lvov on the 24th of June, but no action was taken at that meeting. However, Justice Minister Pereverzev investigated further and was able to obtain a fuller set of 66 telegrams (Lyandres). These proved the existence of an import business from Sweden run by the Bolsheviks, but it was the evidence of contact with known German agents which was damming. The July Days (3 \u2013 7 July) were the Bolshevik\u2019s second attempt at a coup. On the 4th of July Pereverzev shared the information gained from the telegrams with General Peter Polovtsov, commander of the Petrograd garrison, some newspaper editors and other ministers. According to Sean McMeekin, revulsion among the soldiers at the knowledge that Lenin was in contact with the enemy brought them on the side of the provisional government and ended the coup attempt. The next day Pereverzev\u2019s men raided the Kschessinskaya mansion where the Bolsheviks were based. Many Bolsheviks were arrested and Lenin fled to Finland. According to McMeekin, recently opened Russian archives contain evidence, from the investigation triggered by the telegrams, that the import business was a front for laundering money being sent by the German government to the Bolsheviks. We can suppose, then, that Pierre and Bronia\u2019s activities, helped to postpone the Bolshevik revolution from July to the \u201cOctober Revolution\u201d some four months later. A year after the October Revolution, in October 1918, Bronis\u0142awa escaped on a false French passport under the name of \"Jeanne-Liliane Lalande\". While in Petrograd she had met Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski, a Polish officer. At considerable personal risk to herself she was able to persuade the Cheka to release him from Taganka Prison in Moscow to house arrest at her house. They both escaped to Poland, and he became her second husband. They had one daughter, Zuzanna, later Susanna Vernon (11 August 1920 \u2013 3 August 2011). Susanna was the goddaughter of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, the main leader of Poland between the wars, who was a friend of her father. In the summer the family lived in the manor house of Bobowa. They famously had good, if distant, relations with the Hasidic Jews of Bobowa (Bobov) and the Bobov Rebbe Ben Zion Halberstam. The rest of the year they lived in their official residence; a hunting lodge in \u0141azienki Park in the center of Warsaw. When in 1938 General Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski was sent to Rome as Polish ambassador to the government of Benito Mussolini, Bronis\u0142awa accompanied him. When Italy joined the war with the other Axis powers in 1940 they fled together to New York. In 1942 he committed suicide. She and her daughter were looked after for some weeks by Arthur Szyk, the famous cartoonist and anti-Nazi activist. Tatiana Yacovleff du Plessix Liberman was another friend who, with her husband, Alexander Liberman, helped Zuzanna find work at \"Vogue\" magazine and, later, at the United Nations, where she became one of the first simultaneous interpreters. Bronis\u0142awa returned to Europe after the war and died in Paris in August 1953 of the complications of a gall bladder operation. She is buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery under her assumed name; \"Jeanne-Liliane Lalande\" in the Laurent family tomb. As explained in the Russian film mentioned above, after half a century without contact, twenty years after Bronis\u0142awa's death, the Russian and French descendants of Salomon Kliatchkin were re-united.\nDocument[5](Title: Sebasti\u00e1n Borensztein) Sebasti\u00e1n Borensztein (born 22 April 1963, in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine writer and director.

He was of the branch which developed into the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la, who were centred on Tuam in modern County Galway. He is the first member of this branch mentioned in the annals. The first mention of Cenn F\u00e1elad in the annals is in the year 653 when the ally of the Ui Fiachrach Aidhne, Marc\u00e1n mac Tomaini, the king of the Ui Maine was slain in battle in Iarthair Seola by Cenn F\u00e1elad and M\u00e1enach mac B\u00e1eth\u00edne of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain. In the \"Annals of the Four Masters\" it is Maenach who is referred to as chief of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain. The next mention of Cenn F\u00e1elad is in 663 when the \"Annals of Tigernach\" mention that he became king of Connacht in succession to Guaire Aidne mac Colm\u00e1in (died 663). The king lists such as that in the \"Book of Leinster\" also place his reign after Guaire. However, the \"Chronicum Scotorum\" mentions the death of Muirchertach N\u00e1r mac Guairi (died 668) as king of Connacht in 668. The annals also mention a certain Dub-Indracht mac D\u00fanchada as king of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain of Mag nAi in 666.

Francis Byrne believed this killing was in response to the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain policy of subjugation and annexation of subject tribal territories. Cenn F\u00e1elad's descendants included the Muintir Murchadha and their chief, the O'Flaherty, through his son Amhalgadh, sometimes titled kings of Iarthair Connacht in the annals; and the Clann Cosgraigh, headed by McHugh, through Cenn F\u00e1elad's son Dungalaigh.\nDocument[5](Title: C\u00fa Cherca mac F\u00e1el\u00e1in) C\u00fa Cherca mac F\u00e1el\u00e1in( died 712) was a King of Osraige in modern County Kilkenny.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Gilduin of Le Puiset) Gilduin of Le Puiset( d. between 1130 and 1135) was the son of Hugh I of Le Puiset and Alice of Monthl\u00e9ry, daughter of Guy I of Montlh\u00e9ry. Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat. It is unclear when Gilduin became abbot of St. Mary, but he was in this position when his cousin Baldwin II confirmed the privileges of the abbey, the chief Marian shrine in Jerusalem, on 31 January 1120. In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin \u2019s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics \u2014 a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. \" Les Lignages d\u2019 Outremer\" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary.\nDocument[2](Title: Guillaume de Montfort of Hainaut) Guillaume de Montfort, also known as Guillaume of Hainaut, was a French nobleman of the 10th and 11th centuries, the first Lord of Montfort- l' Amaury. He was succeeded as Lord of Montfort- l' Amaury by his son Amaury I de Montfort.\nDocument[3](Title: Hilduin I, Count of Montdidier) Hilduin I( died before 956), Count of Montdidier. It is unknown who the parents of Hilduin were. Hilduin was the founder of the House of Montdidier, which produced the Counts of Montdidier, Dammartin and Roucy. There is considerable confusion as to the immediate family of Hilduin among historians and genealogists because of the lack of documented evidence, the preponderance of the names of Hilduin and Manasses in the family and the existence of other contemporary Hilduins( particularly, the Count of Montreuil). The only creditable reference to Hilduin I was when Philip I, King of France, donated the village of Bagneux to the Abbey of Saint- Germain- des- Pr\u00e9s in exchange for Combs la Ville by charter dated 1061, which recounts that Hugh the Great had granted Combs to\" Hilduino\u2026comiti de Monte qui vocatur Desiderius\", who died before his benefactor( before 956), and that Henry I, King of France, had regranted Combs to\" Manasses nepos supradicti Hilduini comitis\"[ Manasses, grandson of Hilduin] just as\" suus avunculus Hilduinus\"[ his uncle Hilduin] had held it, noting that\" Odo comes filius prefati Manassetis\"[ Odo, son of Manasses] now claimed the property. Historians disagree as to the exact disposition of the descendants, but all agree that they descended from Hersende, Dame of Ramerupt, who was married to Hilduin I, or his son of the same name, or his brother, or, in some interpretations, his daughter. We can not resolve these competing claims and will assume that Hilduin was married to Hersende( Heldwide). In 948, the first church in Montdidier, Somme, was built near the castle of Charlemagne by Hersende. The count and his wife had two children: The next known Count of Montdidier was Hilduin III, grandson of Hilduin I. The apparent gap in the countship is unexplained. A common mistake is to assume the Hugh I, Count of Ponthieu, husband of Gisele, daughter of Hugh Capet, was the son of Hilduin I, when, in fact, his father was Hilduin( Herluin), Count of Montreuil, as discussed by Flodoard.\nDocument[4](Title: Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette) Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette (1554\u20131642), created Duke of \u00c9pernon, was a powerful member of the French nobility at the turn of the 16th century. He was deeply involved in plots and politics throughout his life. He was born at Caumont in Gascony, the son of Jean de Nogaret de La Valette and Jeanne de Saint-Lary de Bellegarde. His father and grandfather being both military men, it was natural that young Jean Louis would choose a soldier's life. He fought on the Catholic side in the French Wars of Religion; at the Siege of La Rochelle (1572\u20131573), he first came to the notice of the duc d'Anjou, the future Henry III of France. By December 1578, Nogaret had been accepted into Henri's most intimate circle of favourites, \"Les Mignons\". In 1581, Henry sold him the town of \u00c9pernon, at the same time raising it to the rank of a duchy thus creating Nogaret the first duc d'\u00c9pernon. The new duke of \u00c9pernon was highly favored by Henry, who showered titles upon him, among them ma\u00eetre de camp of the Champagne regiment (1579), Governor of F\u00e8re (1580), Colonel-general of the infantry (1581), First Gentleman of the King's Chamber (1582), Chevalier de l\u2019Ordre du Saint-Esprit, Governor of Boulonnais, Loches, Lyon, Metz and its surrounding areas (1583), Chevalier des Ordres du roi (1584), and Governor of Provence (1586). At the death of the duc de Joyeuse (1587) he was awarded the titles of Admiral of France, Governor of Normandy, of Caen, and of Le Havre. After the assassination of Henry III in 1589, \u00c9pernon opposed the accession of Henry of Navarre (Henry IV of France) and attempted to install an independent government in Provence. His attempt failed and in 1596 he was obliged to submit himself to the king, which he did. He had not forgiven or forgotten, however, and in 1610 he was involved in the conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Henry IV by Ravaillac, who lodged, in his preparatory visits to Paris, with \u00c9pernon's mistress, Charlotte du Tillet. He played a large part in the immediate acceptance of Henri's widow, Marie de' Medici, as regent, her son Louis XIII being then too young to rule. The duc d'\u00c9pernon was active in government until 1618 or so; in 1617, he participated in the persecution and murder of the Huguenots in Guienne. He was named military governor of Guienne in 1622, where he lived quietly for more than ten years in the Ch\u00e2teau de Cadillac. In 1634, however, his deteriorating relationship with Henri de Sourdis (brother and successor of Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois de Sourdis) led to a public altercation in which \u00c9pernon struck Sourdis. Furious , Sourdis demanded his excommunication and \u00c9pernon was disgraced and exiled. He gave up his post at Guienne in 1638 and died in the Ch\u00e2teau de Loches in January 1642 at the age of 88. Jean Louis and his wife Marguerite were buried at Saint-Blaise de Cadillac, Gironde. The tomb, built of marble and surmounted by a winged female figure in bronze, was inspired by the great royal tombs at Basilica of Saint Denis and by the monument of Anne de Montmorency. The tomb was destroyed in 1792 and the bronze statue of Fame by Pierre Biard now resides in the Louvre; other fragments of the tomb, including marble heads of the duke and duchess, are in the museum of Aquitaine, in Bordeaux. Through his son Pierre's granddaughter Anne Catherine de La Valette (1653\u20131699) and her husband Daniel Collot-d'Escury, Seigneur de Landauran (1643\u20131714), he is an ancestor of actress Audrey Hepburn.

In 1870, he discovered one of the most important units of Cenozoic fossils in Brazil: Pirabas. He also made important archaeological discoveries that 20th century archaeologists confirmed. In three letters published by the National Museum( 1876 a, 1876 b, 1877), recorded his observations on the shell mounds installed in the dark and swampy regions on the east coast of Para, which he excavated, measured, and mapped, making notes on their condition, conservation, and archeological conditions- human bones, lithic and ceramic artefacts- describing them and locating them in their stratigraphic layers. He correctly identified the coastal and riverine shellmounds of Para as villages inhabited by early fishing people, an insight that scientific archaeologists confirmed in the 1990s. Always sharing his knowledge with other scholars, he urged geologist Charles Hartt to study the shellmound of Taperinha. About 100 years later, Taperinha and several other fluvial shellmounds with pottery in the Lower Amazon were shown through radiocarbon dating and luminescence dating to be early Holocene in age, c. 9.000 to 7,000 BP calibrated, making them the earliest pottery sites yet known in the Americas and among the earliest in the world.

The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars Danielle Savre, Matt Cohen, Tobin Bell and Renee O'Connor. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the Boogeyman, and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one. Due to the previous film's financial success,\" Boogeyman 2\" was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December of the same year with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital, over a four- month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural being, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small$ 4.5 million budget.

The infant Gustav was present at his mother's wedding to the King of Sweden in 1568 and at her coronation, together with his sister Sigrid. The presence of the children was a way to demonstrate their new status: both of them were officially confirmed as legitimate, and Gustav and his sister were given all the privileges of a royal prince and princess. After his father's dethronement, Gustav was sent to live outside of Sweden in 1575, to protect him from King John III who feared that the supporters of Eric would try to deprive his son of the crown. Gustav came to Poland where he lived in poverty and despair. At some time during his stay he became a Catholic. Ivan IV of Russia attempted to persuade Gustav to help him in his political ambitions around the Baltic, but these attempts (which included both promises and several years exile) failed. In August 1599 Gustav arrived in Moscow for a proposed marriage to the Tsar Boris Godunov's daughter Ksenia. But there, he lived a self-indulgent life. As a consequence, he invited his old lover Brita and their children to stay in his Russian home, and showing them in public in a carriage harnessed as though it was meant for the tsarina. As a result, the Tsar eventually broke off the engagement of his beloved daughter. As compensation, the homeless Gustav received the principality of Uglich, where he lived until the beginning of the reign of the False Dmitry, who ordered his arrest by the demands of his ally \u2014 Sigismund III Vasa (cousin of Gustav and son of King John III) and sent him to Yaroslavl jail.

Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.\nDocument[2](Title: Ankhesenpepi IV) Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.\nDocument[3](Title: Ankhesenpepi II) Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.\nDocument[4](Title: Pepi II Neferkare) Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC \u2013 after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (\"Nefer-ka-Re\"), means \"Beautiful is the Ka of Re\". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks\u2014the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II\u2014were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: \"King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II\". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\nDocument[5](Title: Khedebneithirbinet I) Khedebneithirbinet I( \u201c Neith Kills the Evil Eye \u201d) was an ancient Egyptian queen from the 26th Dynasty, probably the wife of pharaoh Necho II and the mother of his successor, Psamtik II.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?": [

The quartet was formed in 1955 performing locally and, in 1964, they began singing backup for Johnny Cash until 1972. Originally performing gospel music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen. In 1963, when the song \"Louie, Louie\" by the garage rock band also called The Kingsmen became famous, the group elected to bill themselves as The Statler Brothers. Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) are actual brothers and none has the surname of Statler. The band, in fact, named themselves after a brand of facial tissue they had noticed in a hotel room (they joked that they could have turned out to be the Kleenex Brothers). Don Reid sang lead; Harold Reid, Don's older brother, sang bass; Phil Balsley sang baritone; and Lew DeWitt sang tenor and was the guitarist of the Statlers before being replaced by Jimmy Fortune in 1983 due to DeWitt's ill health. DeWitt continued to perform as a solo artist until his death on August 15, 1990, from heart and kidney disease. The band's style was closely linked to their gospel roots. \"We took gospel harmonies,\" said Harold Reid, \"and put them over in country music. \" The group remained closely tied to their gospel roots, with a majority of their records containing at least one gospel song. They produced several albums containing only gospel music and recorded a tribute song to the Blackwood Brothers, who influenced their music.

Starring Eusebio Poncela as Pablo, Carmen Maura as Tina and Antonio Banderas as Antonio. It was the first film Almod\u00f3var made independently with his own production company\" El Deseo\". The story focuses on a complex love triangle between two men and a trans woman. Pablo, a successful gay film director, disappointed in his relationship with his young lover, Juan, concentrates in a new project, a monologue starring his transsexual sister, Tina. Antonio, an uptight young man, falls possessively in love with the director and in his passion would stop at nothing to obtain the object of his desire. The relationship between Pablo and Antonio is at the core of the film, however, the story and own drama of Pablo's sister, Tina, plays a strong role in the plot. Shot in the later part of 1986,\" Law of Desire\" was Almod\u00f3var's first work centered in homosexual relationships. He considers\" Law of Desire\" the key film in his life and career. It follows the more serious tone set by Almod\u00f3var's previous film,\" Matador\", exploring the unrestrained force of desire. It s themes are: love, loss, gender, family, sexuality and the close link between life and art. \" Law of Desire\" was met with general positive reactions from film critics, and it was a hit with audiences becoming Almod\u00f3var's most successful film up to that point. It toured many international film festival, winning the Teddy Award in Berlin and it made Almod\u00f3var known internationally.

The film follows a Union soldier- turned- drifter and his companion, a mixed- race prostitute, who become embroiled in a bitter, destructive feud between a gang of Confederate Red Shirts and a band of Mexican revolutionaries. Intended to capitalize on and rival the success of Sergio Leone's\" A Fistful of Dollars\", Corbucci's film is, like Leone's, considered to be a loose, unofficial adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's\" Yojimbo\". The film earned a reputation as one of the most violent films ever made at the time, and was subsequently refused a certificate in the United Kingdom until 1993, when it was issued an 18 certificate( the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004). A commercial success upon release,\" Django\" has garnered a large cult following outside of Italy and is widely regarded as one of the best films of the Spaghetti Western genre, with the direction, Nero's performance, and Luis Bacalov's soundtrack most frequently being praised. Although the name is referenced in over thirty\" sequels\" from the time of the film's release until the early 1970s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, most of these films were unofficial, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero reprised his role as Django in 1987's\" Django Strikes Again\", the only official sequel produced with Corbucci's involvement. Nero also made a cameo appearance in Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film\" Django Unchained\", as homage to Corbucci's original.

It was the first feature film to be created in Poland following the six years of World War II. The film, set during the German occupation of Warsaw during the war, tells the story of several inhabitants of the same tenement house. Their stories are loosely tied together by a set of songs, both pre-war ballads popular during the war and war-time popular songs mocking German occupation (\"Siekiera, motyka\"). The film's premiere took place on 8 January 1947 in the newly reopened cinema in Warsaw. The film proved to be highly popular and more than 10.8 million people watched it in the following three years - twice the usual average attendance in post-war Poland. In 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released in a new version, with more focus on Red Army's role as the \"liberator\" of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as more grim outlook of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general. Main differences: However, as the farcical plot and all-familiar songs were mostly free of ideological subtexts, the film remained popular in the decades to come and some of its songs re-emerged in slightly modified form during the 1980s martial law and struggle against the Communist rule. The film remains well-known and popular even in modern Poland, being screened by the public Polish Television (TVP) on a regular basis.

After his 1972 success with \"Deep Throat\", Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania. Along with \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\", the film is associated with a time in American culture known as \"porno chic\", in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert).

The film is an Italian\u2013American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises, and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel \"The Hoods\", it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third film of Leone's \"Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", which includes \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) and \"Duck, You Sucker!\" (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released more recently, Torrente 2: Misi\u00f3n En Marbella or The Heart Of New York (Film)?": [

It was also one of the first albums ever to achieve multi-platinum certification in the US, achieving the certification on October 12, 1984.\nDocument[4](Title: The 31st of February) The 31st of February was a rock and roll band formed by Jacksonville, Florida natives Scott Boyer, David Brown, and Butch Trucks. All three were alumni of Englewood High School in Jacksonville, though they did not come together musically until Brown and Trucks found themselves living on the same floor of a dormitory at Florida State University in the fall of 1965. Having heard the folk- rock of groups like The Byrds and The Lovin' Spoonful, saxophonist Brown bought an electric bass and started to jam with drummer Trucks, an alumnus of The Vikings, The Echoes, and the Jacksonville Symphonette. Guitarist and vocalist Boyer, making his living as a folk singer, was contacted by Brown who offered his and Trucks' services if Boyer would trade his acoustic guitar for an electric guitar. Boyer agreed and the three formed a group, The Bitter Ind.( short for Independents). Playing fraternity parties, growing their hair long, and ceasing to attend their classes( in Brown's and Trucks' cases), the group left Tallahassee after the end of the school year and tried their hand at performing in Daytona Beach. After being turned down repeatedly by club owners, the group found a bit of luck, landing a one- night performance at the Club Martinique. Shortly into their set, two members of the Allman Joys, a group that frequently appeared at the club, walked in and sat down. After the group finished, the two members introduced themselves and lavished praise on the group. They were the namesakes of the Allman Joys, Duane and Gregg Allman. When the Bitter Ind. relayed their story of their inability to get steady employment, the Allmans offered them free lodging. In time, the Bitter Ind. returned to Jacksonville discouraged, their meeting with the brothers Allman the only high point of their journey. Shortly after returning to Jacksonville, however, Trucks received a call from Duane Allman, stating that the Allman Joys were playing at the Beachcomber, a Jacksonville club, and that they needed a drummer. Trucks agreed to sit in for the night. After the show, Duane Allman suggested to Trucks to ask the club manager to let the Bitter Ind. audition. The manager agreed, loved the group's sound, and let them stay on through mid-1967. After their engagement ended, the group, no doubt under threat of legal action from the New York nightclub The Bitter End, decided to change their name. After briefly using the moniker\" The Tiffany System\", the group found themselves in Miami, Florida, signed to folk giant Vanguard Records as The 31st of February. Their eponymous debut album was released in early 1968, a mix of folk rock and psychedelic pop. After its failure to get noticed, the group added a lead guitarist and began to rework their sound. Almost immediately, the group again ran into Duane and Gregg Allman, who had just broken up their post -Allman Joys group The Hour Glass. Electing to join forces, the newly hired guitarist was fired and the remaining five- piece began performing throughout the Southeast. In September 1968, they began recording material for their second album, including nascent versions of\" Melissa\"( which would come out on the Allman Brothers Band's\" Eat A Peach\" album in 1972) and\" Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out\"( which Duane Allman would later cut with Derek and the Dominos). Though the material would not come out until four years later, they serve as an important bridge towards the sound that The Allman Brothers Band would be producing within twelve months. Whilst in the midst of recording and touring, Gregg Allman elected to move out to southern California in order to let his brother and the remaining members of the Hour Glass be freed from their contract with Liberty Records. Though Gregg offered the others positions in his backing band, nothing came of it and in a matter of months, Butch Trucks would join Duane and Gregg Allman in The Allman Brothers Band. Scott Boyer ended up forming the group Cowboy with Tommy Talton, eventually signing to the Allman Brothers Band's label, Capricorn Records. He had artery replacement surgery and was the subject of benefit gigs in 2007. David Brown ended up a studio bassist, eventually joining Boz Scaggs's band and, later, Cowboy with Boyer. He remains a member of Norton Buffalo and the Knockouts despite Norton Buffalo's untimely death on 30 October 2009. After joining the Allman Brothers Band, Butch Trucks has stayed there since 1969, save for the group's first( 1976 \u2013 1979) and second( 1982\u20131989) hiatuses.\nDocument[5](Title: The Opposite Six) The Opposite Six were an American garage rock band from Sacramento, California, United States, who were active in the 1960s. They are not to be confused with another group of the same name, also from the Bay area, but from Marin County that had a more folk rock orientation and comprised the basis of the later group the Sons of Champlin. This group was known for a more primal 60s punk sound, which in spite of their lack of wider success, have come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts over the years. Their work has appeared on several compilations. The band was initially formed as the Avengers, a surf rock outfit, by students at El Camino High School in Sacramento, California in 1965. Their membership included Ed Dunk on vocals, Don Wright and Hal Hanefield on rhythm guitar, Larry McGlade on lead guitar, Brent MacIntosh on bass, and Jack Androvich on drums. Eventually the group changed their name to\" Six and the Single Girl\" which was a homage to a singing diva at El Camino High whom the members fancied an association with, but later changed the name to the Opposite Six, which, itself a pun, grew out of their prior moniker. The band went to local media personality, Bill Rase's primitive studio to record a single featuring the self- pened\" I'll Be Gone,\" written by guitarist Don Wright which was a ragged Kinks and Rolling Stones- influenced number featuring Ed Dunk's nasal vocal and was backed with\" Why Did You Lie?\" The record was released on the Spectre label in January, 1966. The song became a big hit locally. After graduating from high school, the Opposite Six broke up. Don Wright later cut another version of\" Why Did You Lie?\" backed with\" Draft Dodger Blues\" on Spectre in the Fall of 1966 with former bandmates Brent MacIntosh and Jack Androvich, credited as\" Don Wright and the Head Set.\" In the years since their breakup, the Opposite Six's work has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and has appeared on compilations. \" I'm Gone\" is included on\" Nuggets from the Golden State: The Sound Of Young Sacramento\" assembled by Big Beat Records and\" Teenage Shutdown! I'm a No- Count,\" put out by Crypt. \" Why Did You Lie?\" appears on\" So Cold !!!

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)) Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, (6\u201339) was the son of consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. He and his sister Aemilia Lepida were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula's elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married to Caligula's younger sister Julia Drusilla). He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried. The motion was carried and Lepidus was not given a proper burial.\nDocument[2](Title: Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6)) Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC \u2013 33 AD) was a Roman senator, politician and general, praised by the historian Tacitus.\nDocument[3](Title: Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (78 BC)) Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( 120 BC \u2013 77 BC) was a Roman statesman and general. After the death of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, he attempted to undermine the Sullan constitution and revive the\" populares\" faction. This brought him into conflict with the optimates whom Sulla had put back in power. In 77 BC, when he was recalled from his proconsulship of Gaul, he returned to Rome at the head of an army and an armed conflict erupted. Lepidus' forces were defeated in a battle near the Milvian Bridge and as a result his rebellion failed. He was the father of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and of one of the consuls for 50 BC Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus.\nDocument[4](Title: Manius Aemilius Lepidus (consul 11)) Manius Aemilius Lepidus was the son or nephew of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger and consul of Rome in 11 AD.

At the trial of Clutorius Priscus, he argued without success that the proposed death sentence was excessively harsh.

Sigismund was the only legitimate son of Italian-born Bona Sforza and Sigismund the Old. From the beginning he was groomed and extensively educated as a successor. In 1529 he was crowned \"vivente rege\" while his father was still alive. Sigismund Augustus continued a tolerance policy towards minorities and maintained peaceful relations with neighbouring countries, with the exception of the Northern Seven Years' War which aimed to secure Baltic trade. Under his patronage the culture flourished in Poland; he was a collector of tapestries from the Low Countries and collected military memorabilia as well as swords and armours. Sigismund Augustus' rule is widely considered as the apex of the Polish Golden Age. In 1569 he oversaw the signing of the Union of Lublin between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and introduced an elective monarchy. Sigismund Augustus married three times; his first wife, Elizabeth of Austria, died in 1545 at just eighteen. He was then involved in several relationships with mistresses, the most famous being Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, who became Sigismund's second wife and Queen of Poland in spite of his mother's disapproval. The marriage was deemed scandalous and was fiercely opposed by the royal court and the nobility. Barbara died five months after her coronation, presumably due to ill health, however, rumours circulated that she was poisoned. Sigismund finally wedded Catherine of Austria, but remained childless throughout his life. Sigismund Augustus was last male member of the Jagiellons.

He was the second son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, sister of Frederick the Great.

He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604\u20131611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.\nDocument[4](Title: Charles VII of Sweden) Charles VII or Carl (Swedish: \"Karl Sverkersson\"; c. 1130 \u2013 12 April 1167) was ruler of G\u00f6taland, and then King of Sweden from c. 1161 to 1167, when he was assassinated. He is the first historically known king of Sweden by the name of Charles, but use of the ordinal VII is widespread.\nDocument[5](Title: Charles IX of Sweden) Charles IX, also Carl (4 October 1550 \u2013 30 October 1611), was King of Sweden from 1604 until his death. He was the youngest son of King Gustav I and his second wife, Margaret Leijonhufvud, brother of Eric XIV and John III, and uncle of Sigismund who was king of both Sweden and Poland. By his father's will he got, by way of appanage, the Duchy of S\u00f6dermanland, which included the provinces of N\u00e4rke and V\u00e4rmland; but he did not come into actual possession of them till after the fall of Eric and the succession to the throne of John in 1568. Both Charles and one of his predecessors, Eric XIV (1560\u201368), took their regnal numbers according to a fictitious history of Sweden. He was actually the third Swedish king called Charles. He came into the throne by championing the Protestant cause during the increasingly tense times of religious strife between competing sects of Christianity. In just over a decade, these would break out as the Thirty Years' War. These conflicts had already caused the dynastic squabble rooted in religious freedom that deposed his nephew and brought him to rule as king of Sweden. His reign marked the start of the final chapter (dated 1648 by some) of both the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. With his brother's death in November 1592, the throne of Sweden went to his nephew and Habsburg ally, Sigismund of Poland and Sweden. During these tense political times, Charles viewed the inheritance of the throne of Protestant Sweden by his devout Roman Catholic nephew with alarm. Thus, several years of religious controversy and discord followed. During the period, Charles and the Swedish privy council ruled in Sigismund's name while he stayed in Poland. After various preliminaries, the Riksdag of the Estates forced Sigismund to abdicate the throne to Charles IX in 1595. This eventually kicked off nearly seven decades of sporadic warfare as the two lines of the divided House of Vasa both continued to attempt to remake the union between the Polish and Swedish thrones with opposing counter-claims and dynastic wars. Quite likely, the dynastic outcome between Sweden and Poland's House of Vasa exacerbated and radicalized the later actions of Europe's Catholic princes in the German states such as the Edict of Restitution. In fact, it worsened European politics to the abandonment or prevention of settling events by diplomacy and compromise during the vast bloodletting that was the Thirty Years' war.\n\nQuestion: Who is Charles Xiii Of Sweden's paternal grandfather?": [

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. His songs include \"We Will Rock YouTie Your Mother DownI Want It AllFat Bottomed GirlsFlashHammer to FallSave MeWho Wants to Live Forever\" and \"The Show Must Go On\". May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album \"A Night at the Opera\" and its single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special. Following the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of \"Made in Heaven\" (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 26 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In 2012, he was ranked the second greatest guitarist in a \"Guitar World\" magazine readers poll. In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. May was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for \"services to the music industry and for charity work\". May earned a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007, and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013. He was a \"science team collaborator\" with NASA's \"New Horizons\" Pluto mission. He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day. Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him. May is also an animal rights activist, campaigning against the hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers in the UK.\nDocument[4](Title: Queen (band)) On 11 April 2006, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the American singing contest television show American Idol. Each contestant was required to sing a Queen song during that week of the competition. Songs which appeared on the show included \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"The Show Must Go On\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", and \"Innuendo\". Brian May later criticised the show for editing specific scenes, one of which made the group's time with contestant Ace Young look negative, despite it being the opposite. Taylor and May again appeared on the American Idol season 8 finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists Adam Lambert and Kris Allen. On 15 November 2009, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the singing contest television show X Factor in the UK.\nDocument[5](Title: Queen (band)) Before forming Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile. Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. Their performance at 1985's Live Aid is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications, with a 2005 industry poll ranking it the best. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have occasionally performed together, including with Paul Rodgers (2004\u201309) and with Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014, Queen released a new album, Queen Forever, featuring vocals from the late Mercury.\n\nQuestion: Which country the performer of song I Might Have Been Queen is from?": [

On 18 October 1943, the Thai government under Prime Minister Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram took over the administration of Terengganu from the Japanese and continued to recognise Sultan Ali as the legitimate Sultan. When the British returned after the end of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali. Allegedly, Sultan Ali was too much in debt and had been too close to the Japanese during their occupation. According to Sultan Ali, the British Military Administration wanted him removed for his refusal to sign the Malayan Union treaty. The British Military Administration also disapproved of Sultan Ali's character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort Tengku Putri Hajjah \u2018 Ain ul- Jamal,\" Tengku Sri Nila Utama\" of Pahang( the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had contracted an unsuitable second marriage to a former prostitute. On 5 November 1945 the Terengganu State Council of thirteen members announced the dismissal of Sultan Ali and the appointment of Tengku Ismail as the sixteenth Sultan of Terengganu. Tengku Ismail became known as Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah and was installed on 6 June 1949 at Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu. Sultan Ismail's descendants have since ruled Terengganu. Sultan Ali continued to dispute his dismissal until his death on 17 May 1996.\n\nQuestion: Where did Sultan Walad's father die?": [

It is a remake of the 1932 film and tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana( Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord. The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983. The film was shot in Louisville and in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder. De Palma dedicated this version of\" Scarface\" after the writers of the original, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht. \" Scarface\" was released on December 9, 1983 and grossed$ 44 million at the domestic box office and$ 65.9 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, however, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music as well as comic books, television programs, and video games, although over the years, the film has been regarded as a cult film.\nDocument[2](Title: Mister Scarface) Mister Scarface (originally l Padroni della citt\u00e0, also known as Rulers of the City) is a 1976 Italian \"poliziottesco\" film directed by Fernando Di Leo and starring Jack Palance.\nDocument[3](Title: Mister Scarface) Mister Scarface( originally l Padroni della citt\u00e0, also known as Rulers of the City) is a 1976 Italian\" poliziottesco\" film directed by Fernando Di Leo and starring Jack Palance.\nDocument[4](Title: Captain Scarface) Captain Scarface is a 1953 American thriller film directed by Paul Guilfoyle.\nDocument[5](Title: M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n) M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n (born M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n Valle; August 20, 1936 -- March 3, 2017) was a Puerto Rican actress.

Narapati then married her off to Sithu Kyawhtin, then governor of Salin, a powerful figure in the Confederation of Shan States, in a marriage of state in the late 1530s. (Prome was then a de facto vassal state of the Confederation, which controlled all of Ava territories except Toungoo in Upper Burma.) Her stay at Salin lasted until January 1544 when the city was captured by Toungoo forces under Gen. Bayinnaung. Her husband escaped to Ava (Inwa) but she was captured and sent to Pegu (Bago).

He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as\" Irgum Tekle Haymanot\" or\" Tekle Haymanot the Cursed\" Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned. Tekle Haymanot quickly returned to Gondar, despite the difficulty of travel during the rainy season, forced the usurper to flee, and celebrated his triumph. Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or\" Era of the Princes\"( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.\nDocument[2](Title: Tekle Haymanot of Gondar) Tekle Haymanot was proclaimed Emperor(\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\") ( February 1788 \u2013 1789) of Ethiopia by the Emperor Baede Maryam's courtiers.

His father had restored the fortunes of the Dal Fiatach dynasty but upon his death a succession struggle broke out. Eochaid was challenged for the kingship by his kinsmen Tommaltach mac Cathail.

The Ulaid were victorious and slew the King of Coba, Eochu mac Aililla. On the side of the Ulaid, Cairell mac Cathail of the Leth Cathail branch was slain. In 809 the high king \u00c1ed Oirdnide campaigned against Ulaid and defeated them ravaging from the Bann to Strangford Lough.

She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called\" daughter of his body\". On a relief found at Saqqara she is called\" his beloved daughter\" and\" king's daughter\". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the\" noble woman\" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.\nDocument[2](Title: Amenherkhepshef) Amenherkhepshef( also Amenherkhepshef D to distinguish him from earlier people of the same name) was an Ancient Egyptian prince and a son of Ramesses VI with Queen Nubkhesbed.

She was a secondary wife of Thutmose I\u2014 Queen Ahmose was the chief wife\u2014and the mother of Thutmose II. Based on her titles of \"King's Daughter\" and \"King's Sister\", she is likely to have been a daughter of Ahmose I and a sister of Amenhotep I. It is likely that she was also the mother of Thutmose I's other sons, Amenmose, Wadjmose and Ramose. She was depicted in the Deir el-Bahri temple built by her grandson Thutmose III; on a stela found at the Ramesseum; on the colossus of her son; and a statue of her bearing a dedication by Thutmose II was found in Wadjmose's chapel.

Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30\u201335 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu.

A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace, he was a recipient of the \"Pour le M\u00e9riteThe Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 1 (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen. An early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in Adolf Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to morphine which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the Gestapo, which he ceded to Heinrich Himmler in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the Fall of France in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of \"Reichsmarschall\", which gave him seniority over all officers in Germany's armed forces. By 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the Second World War progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities and resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest. After the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out.\nDocument[2](Title: Wolfgang Herrndorf) Wolfgang Herrndorf( 12 June 1965 \u2013 26 August 2013) was a German author, painter, and illustrator.\nDocument[3](Title: Friedrich Wilhelm von G\u00f6tzen the Younger) Friedrich Wilhelm von G\u00f6tzen( the younger; 1767- 1820) was a Prussian general.\nDocument[4](Title: Albert Wolfgang, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe) Albrecht Wolfgang, Count of Schaumburg- Lippe( 27 April 1699 \u2013 24 September 1748) was a ruler of the County of Schaumburg- Lippe.\nDocument[5](Title: Wolfgang Metzger) Wolfgang Metzger( born July 22, 1899 in Heidelberg, Germany; died December 20, 1979 in Bebenhausen, Germany) is considered one of the main representatives of Gestalt psychology( Gestalt theory) in Germany.

It was released in December 1989 as the third single from his album . The song peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and reached number 15 on the \"RPM\" Country Tracks chart in Canada. \"If You Want to Be My Woman\" was Haggard's last top-40 country hit; like most classic country artists, Haggard's chart career was severely damaged by changes in the country industry that hit in the early 1990s.

The song came near the apex of the counterculture era and, by celebrating female empowerment, became an enduring anthem for the women's liberation movement.\nDocument[4](Title: You Are the Woman) \" You Are the Woman\" is the title of a 1976 Top Ten hit by Firefall. Written by Rick Roberts, then the group's frontman, the track is distinguished by the performance on flute of Firefall member David Muse. Roberts would recall writing\" You Are the WomanWhen that chorus and tune jumped into my head I realized I was[ not] creating ... one of the great works of art in history ...[ but rather] a bouncy little pop ditty ... I was stumped for several months about where the verses should go[ ie. develop] lyrically. Then I realized I was over thinking it. I took a more simple approach, and the verses were finished in a day or two.\" Steve Heflin recalls that right after the song jumped into Rick's head, a group of his friends were fortunate to have him sing it for them. Steve Heflin, Chris Wienard, and Janet Cooper, were gathered around Rick who was sitting on the arm of an over stuffed chair in Chris' apartment in Boulder Colorado. Rick sang that song and played the guitar, and amazed us with its beauty. Introduced on\" Firefall\", the band's debut album recorded at Miami's Criteria Studios and released in the spring of 1976,\" You Are the Woman\" was issued as the album's second single that summer after several other tracks had received airplay on FM radio including the lead single:\" Livin' Ai n't Livin'\", which had just missed the Top 40 of the Hot 100 in\" Billboard\". After two months of support in smaller markets,\" You Are the Woman\" broke in such larger areas as Chicago and Houston in October 1976, affecting a Top 40 entry with a subsequent ascent to a# 9 peak that November. \" You Are the Woman\" also peaked at# 6 on the Easy Listening chart. Jock Bartley of Firefall would account for the popularity of\" You Are the Woman\" thus:\" Every female between the ages of 18 and 24 wanted to be the woman portrayed in the song, and that caused their boyfriends and spouses to call radio stations and subsequently flood the airwaves with dedications of the song and the sentiment. The message was simple and sincere, and the song was easy to sing. It was like our fans let us be a singing version of the Hallmark card that said what they were n't quite sure what to express.\" Bartley, the sole founding member of Firefall who has remained with the group to the present( though, as of 2015, Muse and founding bassist Mark Andes have rejoined), also states:\" Everybody knows' You Are The Woman'. It ended up kind of being a hindrance because people would only hear' You Are The Woman' and would think, oh, that light Rock band from Colorado. We're actually a pretty smokin' Rock band that really has fun onstage and cooks and jams and plays' You Are The Woman' also.\" A hit for Firefall in Canada(# 6) and New Zealand(# 15),\" You Are the Woman\" was remade by Josh Kelley for the( 2005).\nDocument[5](Title: Man!

Alexandra's family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his distant cousin, Frederick VII of Denmark. At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent of Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later in 1863, the same year her father became King Christian IX of Denmark and her brother was appointed as King George I of Greece. She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work. On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became king-emperor as Edward VII, with Alexandra as queen-empress. She held the status until Edward's death in 1910. She greatly distrusted her nephew Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and supported her son George V during the First World War, in which Britain and its allies fought Germany.\n\nQuestion: Where was the husband of Princess Alexandra Of Anhalt born?": [

As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" is unresolved.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: \u00c6thelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia) \u00c6thelwald (died 962) was ealdorman of East Anglia. He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of \u00c6thelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when \u00c6thelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of \u00c6lfthryth who married King Edgar after \u00c6thelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta regum anglorum\" has a late account of \u00c6thelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter \u00c6lfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent \u00c6thelwald to see \u00c6lfthryth, ordering him \"to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report. \" When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, \u00c6thelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay \u00c6thelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed \u00c6thelwald. He asked \u00c6lfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed \u00c6thelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the \u00c6thelwald murder story as a \"tissue of romance\" in his \"Historic essays\", but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book \"Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn\". \u00c6thelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother \u00c6thelwine succeeded to his offices. A memorial to \u00c6thelwald, known as the Dead Man's Plack, was erected in Longparish, Hampshire in 1825.\nDocument[2](Title: Oswald of East Anglia) Oswald was king of East Anglia in the 870s after the death of Edmund the Martyr.

He served as an Ealdorman in southern Mercia in the reigns of Kings Eadwig and Edgar. He is referred to as \u00c6thelstan Rota( \u00c6thelstan the Red) in one charter, and is so known to distinguish him from \u00c6thelstan Half- King, and another \u00c6thelstan( fl. 940\u2013949), who were Ealdormen in the same period. \u00c6thelstan rose to prominence in the reign of King Eadwig; \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d of Damerham, second wife of Eadwig's father King Edmund, and thus Eadwig's stepmother, was married to this \u00c6thelstan. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was a woman of considerable influence, and not merely as a relict of King Edmund; her father \u00c6lfgar is described as a\" dux\" and Ealdorman of Essex. \u00c6thelstan appears to have had lands in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. He is a frequent witness to charters of Kings Eadwig and Edgar.

The music was composed by the duo Sabesh- Murali with cinematography by M. S. Prabhu and editing by B. Lenin. The film released on 2 December 2005. The film won the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. At 275 minutes, it is the longest Indian film by runtime. The feature was received well at the box office. The film is a penetrating and artistic depiction of familial bond, underscored by a set of life value messages. It explores the father- son relationship, and particularly charts the travails an Indian father goes through in raising his sons. The film received positive reviews from critics praising the film's plot, performances, and cinematography but criticized the film's lengthy running time. The movie briefly touches upon other relationships, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story, however, revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well- being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people. It also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well- being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family. It is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles \u2014 the father by Rajkiran and the mother by Saranya. Director Cheran has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children.

As Yaroslav's mother, she is thus the paternal grandmother of Alexander Nevsky, whose son, Daniel of Moscow, founded the Muscovite branch of the Rurikid Dynasty. Maria's origins are disputed. Some sources say she was Ossetian or Alan and connected to the Georgian royal house, while others, such as the \"Uspensky Sbornik\" (a 13th-century text now housed in the Russian State Museum in Moscow), say she was Moravian. M. V. Shchepkina posited the idea that the Sbornik was compiled for Maria in 1199-1206, and thus the claims that she was Moravian might be more believable than the other claims, but Caucasian chronicles claim Vsevolod traveled to Tbilisi in 1170 (from Constantinople), where he was married to Maria at the suggestion of the Georgian King. The date of her death is also uncertain, as 19 March 1205 is also given in some accounts. The \"Novgorod First Chronicle\" mentions her death under the year 1205, but does not give an exact day. As it is mentioned after her son Konstantin's arrival in Novgorod on March 20, it would seem she died after that, perhaps in May.\nMaria is venerated as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church and is credited with founding several convents, most notably the Convent of the Assumption, known as the Princess's Convent  in Vladimir on the Kliazma. According to several accounts, the convent was founded in 1200 and Maria took the schema and the name Marfa (although this would have required her to have ended her marriage with Vsevolod, who outlived her by six years). She and her sister, Anna, were buried in the convent and her relics, along with those of several other saints, including Alexander Nevsky's first wife, Princess Alexandra, and his daughter are still kept there.\nDocument[4](Title: Lajos Sch\u00f6nfeld) Lajos Sch\u00f6nfeld, commonly known as Tusko( born 7 September 1901 in Szeged \u2013 died 25 June 1924 in Belgrade) was a Hungarian football goalkeeper. He was one of the most influential players of BSK Belgrade in the early 1920s and is specially remembered for his die- hard attitude in the pitch. He began his career in Szeged where he played with Szegedi T.C. mostly in the youth team and occasionally as reserve in the first squad. until 1917 when he joins Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC where he plays until the end of the First World War. In 1918 because of the hard conditions in his hometown, he leaves Szeged and moved to Novi Sad in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and joins NAK Novi Sad. It is during this period that he travells as a guest with BSK to a tournament in Dalmatia, however he returned to NAK, and shortly after, in 1921, he moved back to Szeged. He rejoined his former club and became the main goalkeeper. His noticed performances made him a call for an exhibition match played in 1921 between the selections of Budapest against the Hungarian Province. This match fielded what were considered the best players in Hungary by that time, divided in two teams, the ones based in the capital Budapest against the ones playing in the rest of the country, with Tusko playing for the second one, as he was based in Szeged. That year he returned to the Novi Sad and joined FK Vojvodina where he stayed during the rest of the 1921 season. and the 1922. That year, despite the interess of numerous clubs, he opted to move to Belgrade and signed with BSK, a team he already knew from the tournament he was a guest in few years earlier, and where he will become one of the main players of the Yugoslav Championship which started in 1923. After two seasons, he became an idol in Belgrade and during 1923 was often named as the best goalkeeper in the country. However, in 1924 he suffered a heavy kidney injury in a clash with an opponent forward in a friendly match between the city selection of Belgrade, for whom he played, and the selection of Lower Austria region. After spending a couple of days in hospital and two surgeries he died. The main local sports newspaper\" Sport\" had extensive coverage of the event and concluded the report with the following sentence:\" He died like a hero and was buried as a small sports King.\" As a result, the Belgrade Football Subassociation created a fund named after him in order to financially support the injured footballers.

Alexandra's family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his distant cousin, Frederick VII of Denmark. At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent of Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later in 1863, the same year her father became King Christian IX of Denmark and her brother was appointed as King George I of Greece. She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work. On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became king-emperor as Edward VII, with Alexandra as queen-empress. She held the status until Edward's death in 1910. She greatly distrusted her nephew Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and supported her son George V during the First World War, in which Britain and its allies fought Germany.\nDocument[5](Title: Alexandra of Yugoslavia) Alexandra of Greece and Denmark (25 March 1921 \u2013 30 January 1993) was, by marriage to King Peter II, the last Queen of Yugoslavia. Posthumous daughter of King Alexander of Greece and his morganatic wife Aspasia Manos , Alexandra was not part of the Greek royal family until July 1922, when at the behest of Queen Sophia, a law was passed which retroactively recognized marriages of members of the royal family, although on a non-dynastic basis; in consequence, she obtained the style and name of \"Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark\". At the same time, a serious political and military crisis, linked to the defeat of Greece against Turkey in Anatolia, gradually led to the deposition and exile of the royal family, beginning in 1924. Being the only members of the dynasty allowed to remain in the country by the Second Hellenic Republic, the princess and her mother later found refuge in Italy, with Dowager Queen Sophia. After three years with her paternal grandmother, Alexandra left Florence to continue her studies in the United Kingdom, while her mother settled in Venice. Separated from her mother, the princess fell ill, forcing Aspasia to make her leave the boarding school where she was studying. After the restoration of her uncle, King George II, on the Hellenic throne in 1935, Alexandra stayed in her native country several times but the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War, in 1940, forcing her and her mother to settle in Athens. The invasion of Greece by the Axis powers in April\u2013May 1941, however, led to their moving to the United Kingdom. Again exiled, Alexandra met in London the young King Peter II of Yugoslavia, who also went into exile after the invasion of his country by the Germans. Quickly, Alexandra and Peter II fell in love and planned to marry. Opposition from both Peter's mother, Maria, and the Yugoslav government in exile forced the couple to delay their marriage plans until 1944, when they finally celebrated their wedding. A year later, Alexandra gave birth to her only son, Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. However, the happiness of the family was short-lived: on 29 November 1945, Marshal Tito proclaimed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Alexandra, who had never set foot in her adopted country, was left without a crown. The abolition of the Yugoslav monarchy had very serious consequences for the royal couple. Penniless and unable to adapt to the role of citizen, Peter II turned to alcoholism and multiple affairs with other women. Depressed by the behaviour of her husband, Alexandra neglected her son and made several suicide attempts. After the death of Peter II in 1970, Alexandra's health continued to deteriorate. She died of cancer in 1993 and her remains were buried in the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi in Greece, before being transferred to the Royal Mausoleum of Oplenac in 2013.\n\nQuestion: Who is Alexandra Of Lithuania's father-in-law?": [

The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's\" Be Here Now\", although its chart stay was brief. \" Do n't Believe the Truth\" went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006( 900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies. This album continued the tradition from their previous album with every member of the band contributing to the writing of tracks for the album, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. \" Do n't Believe the Truth\" is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey who, while not an official member of Oasis, performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White. The album received positive reviews from critics and many cited it as Oasis's best album in a decade. Liam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album by his developing songwriting. Noel has said that this album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members have contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel- written Oasis album. The band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Do n't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2 million people at a total of 113 concerts. This resulted in the making of\" Lord Do n't Slow Me Down\", a film later released on DVD.

He was a younger brother of (among others) Charles Martel of Anjou, Saint Louis of Toulouse, Robert of Naples and Philip I of Taranto. On 3 September 1313 he was named Captain-General of Calabria. In 1315, he succeeded his brother Peter, Count of Gravina after the latter was killed at the Battle of Montecatini. The death of Louis of Burgundy in 1316 widowed Matilda of Hainaut, Princess of Achaea. Her suzerain, John's brother Philip I of Taranto, had her brought by force to Naples in 1318 to marry John, a design intended to bring the Principality of Achaea into the Angevin inheritance. The marriage, celebrated in March 1318, failed of its objective: Matilda refused to surrender her rights to Achaea to her husband and ultimately contracted a secret marriage with Hugh de La Palice. This violated the marriage contract of her mother Isabelle, which had pledged that Isabelle and all her female heirs should not marry without permission of their suzerain. On these grounds, Philip stripped her of Achaea and bestowed it upon John: the marriage was annulled for non-consummation, and Matilda was imprisoned in the Castel dell'Ovo. On 14 November 1321, John took a second wife, Agnes of P\u00e9rigord, daughter of Helie VII, Count of P\u00e9rigord and Brunissende de Foix. They had three sons:\nIn a tardy reaction to the Byzantine advances in the central Morea, in 1325 John launched a military expedition, financed by the Acciaiuoli, to Achaea. While he re-established his authority in Cefaphonia and Zante, he was unable to recapture Skorta from the control of the Byzantine Empire. In 1332, Philip of Taranto died and was succeeded by his son Robert of Taranto, who became the new suzerain of Achaea. Not wishing to swear fealty to his nephew, John arranged to surrender Achaea to him in exchange for Robert's rights to the Kingdom of Albania and a loan of 5,000 ounces of gold raised upon Niccolo Acciaiuoli, and thenceforth adopted the style of \"Duke of Durazzo\".\nDocument[5](Title: Joanna, Duchess of Brabant) Joanna, Duchess of Brabant( 24 June 1322 \u2013 1 November 1406), also known as Jeanne, was a ruling Duchess of Brabant from 1355 until her death.

For a time, he was one of the most successful high limit cash game players of the last decade. He was once referred to as a\" poker savant\" by Phil Laak and is rated as one of the best poker players in the world by Phil Hellmuth and Doyle Brunson. In the thirteenth episode of the third season of\" High Stakes Poker\", Booth stated that he has been playing poker every day for fourteen years \u2013 first in Vancouver, then Calgary, and then in the Yukon, hence his nickname\" Yukon Brad\" \u2013 but is now slowing down.

He continued to play poker online after being cheated, but without his former success. Since 2008, he has lost$ 4.2 million playing poker. Booth appeared on the second season of NBC's\" Poker After Dark\" on the episode\" International Week\" and finished in second place to Patrik Antonius. This match was notable for the length of time it lasted, breaking previous\" Poker After Dark\" heads- up records. As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed$ 710,000. In November 2009, Booth left Full Tilt Poker to become the Spokesman and Director of Poker Programming at GR88.com.

Following the Romantic- era nationalist example of his predecessor Bed\u0159ich Smetana, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's own style has been described as\" the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them\". Dvo\u0159\u00e1k displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later. In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Although Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k in 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the\" Slavonic Dances\", Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music( of the original piano 4- hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's international reputation was launched at last. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. In his career, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works. His Seventh Symphony was written for London. Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1891 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory. In 1890 \u2013 91, he wrote his\" Dumky Trio\", one of his most successful chamber music pieces. In 1892, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony\" From the New World\", which spread his reputation worldwide, and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti. He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music, the\" American String Quartet\", during this time. But shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895. All of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is\" Rusalka\". Among his smaller works, the seventh\" Humoresque\" and the song\" Songs My Mother Taught Me\" are also widely performed and recorded. He has been described as\" arguably the most versatile ... composer of his time\".\nDocument[5](Title: J\u00e1nos Horv\u00e1th) J\u00e1nos Horv\u00e1th (7 November 1921 \u2013 25 November 2019) was a Hungarian economist and politician, member of the National Assembly (MP) from 1998 to 2014.

He was the son of Esteban Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria, and Alzonza Rodr\u00edguez de Le\u00f3n. His paternal grandparents were Fernando Guti\u00e9rrez de Castro and Emilia Iniguez de Mendoza. His maternal grandparents were Rodrigo Alfonso de Le\u00f3n, son of Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n, and Ines Rodr\u00edguez Cabrera. Following the death of his father, Esteban Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, Fernando became Lord of Lemos and Sarria. In 1293, he married Violante S\u00e1nchez of Castile, illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV of Castile. He was one of the most powerful and influential nobles of Galicia, like most members of the House of Castro. In 1304, Fernando took up arms against Ferdinand IV of Castile, by attacking Philip of Castile, who was in Galicia besieging the fortress of Monforte de Lemos. Fernando's advisers tried to persuade him to reach a peace agreement with the Felipe, who was brother of Violente S\u00e1nchez of Castile, his wife. However, no agreement was reached and Fernando Rodriguez de Castro was killed in the ensuing battle.\nDocument[2](Title: Fernando Rodr\u00edguez de Castro) Fernando Rodr\u00edguez (or Fern\u00e1n Ruiz) de Castro  (1125\u20131185) was a Castilian nobleman, statesman and military leader who made his career in Le\u00f3n. He was the leader of the House of Castro during the civil wars that followed the death of Sancho III of Castile and the succession of the infant Alfonso VIII. He was nicknamed el Castellano (\"the Castilian\") in Le\u00f3n and el Leon\u00e9s (\"the Leonese\") in Castile. Fernando was the eldest son of Rodrigo Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro and his wife, Eilo \u00c1lvarez. He led the Castro family in their dispute with the House of Lara over the custody and regency of the young Alfonso VIII after Sancho III's death in August 1158. Early in 1160 the Laras managed to exile him to the court of Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n. He returned to Castile in March with an army and defeated the Laras at the Battle of Lobregal, where his erstwhile father-in-law, Osorio Mart\u00ednez, was killed fighting alongside his enemies, and Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara was captured. Nonetheless, he was unable to reestablish himself in his homeland. Shortly after 1160, with a mixed force of Christians and Muslims, Fernando besieged the recently founded city of Ciudad Rodrigo. Ferdinand II, with the militias of Salamanca and Zamora, came to its relief. Fernando was soon reconciled to the king of Le\u00f3n, who appointed him governor first of Cu\u00e9llar, Due\u00f1as, Salamanca, Toro, Valladolid, and Zamora, and later of Asturias and Benavente. He served Ferdinand II as majordomo, the highest court official in power, on two occasions: between 15 August 1162 and 6 September 1164 and between 19 October 1165 and 15 May 1166. In 1162 Ferdinand II conquered Toledo from Castile and placed it in the hands of Fernando Rodr\u00edguez as governor. Toledo remained a Leonese possession until 1166. In 1164 Fernando returned to Castile a second time with an army and killed Manrique P\u00e9rez de Lara in the Battle of Huete (June/July). In 1168 he was appointed \"alcalde\" in the city of Le\u00f3n, and controlled the city's fortifications (\"tenente turris Legionisheld the towers of Le\u00f3n\") until 1182. In the early summer of 1169, the Portuguese freebooter Gerald the Fearless took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the \"alcazaba\", the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve Gerald. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of Le\u00f3n, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. Fernando Rodr\u00edguez, then majordomo, was one of the Leonese leaders on this expedition. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Fernando captured Gerald. After the m\u00eal\u00e9e the Leonese had control of the town and the \"alcazaba\", which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained C\u00e1ceres, but Trujillo, Mont\u00e1nchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfrag\u00fce he gave to Fernando Ruiz. Fernando thus established a semi-independent lordship between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, with his seat at Trujillo. In 1171 he was granted the \"infantaticum\" of Le\u00f3n. Between 1172 and 1175 Fernando held Mayorga and Melgar de Arriba from the Crown, both had been fiefs of Osorio Mart\u00ednez. He was for the remainder of his career a frequent attendee at both the Leonese and Castilian courts.

Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia( 1354 \u2013 1360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41- year- old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief.

She was the only daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo and his wife, whose name and origins are unknown; her brother, W\u0142adys\u0142aw the White, was later a candidate for the Polish throne. By 1323, King Charles I of Hungary wanted to increase influence over Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. He offered Stephan the hand of Elizabeth, the relative of his own Piast wife Elizabeth. By marrying Elizabeth of Kuyavia, Stephen received from Charles the lands to the west formerly held by Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir and Usora and Soli in the north formerly held by Vladislav, King of Syrmia. The marriage was celebrated by 1339. Up to 1339, Stephan was married to an unknown Bulgarian princess. The only child which can be attributed to Elizabeth of Kuyavia without doubt is Elizabeth of Bosnia, born c. 1340. Some believe that Catherine of Bosnia, Countess of Cilli, was daughter of Elizabeth of Kuyavia and Stephen II, while others argue that Catherine was daughter of Stephen II's brother Vladislaus and his wife Jelena \u0160ubi\u0107. Elizabeth may have also had a son, Vuk who may have survived infancy but he did not outlive his father so never became Ban of Bosnia. Vuk may have been the son of one of Stephen's previous two wives. Stephen outlived Elizabeth. It is unknown what Elizabeth died of. Judging by the time, it is possible that she died of Black Death, which was sweeping across Europe during the 14th century. Banness Elizabeth was buried in Bobovac in a tomb which she shared with her husband, brother- in- law Vladislaus and sister- in- law Jelena.

Bury was the only son of Charles Bury, 1st Earl of Charleville, by Catherine Maria Dawson, daughter of Thomas Townley Dawson. He was educated at Eton and served as High Sheriff of King's County in 1825. In 1826 he was returned to parliament for Carlow Borough, a seat controlled by the family. The constituency was abolished in the Great Reform Act of 1832 and Bury's father launched an expensive campaign to keep his son in the House of Commons. He failed to be elected for King's County but was returned for Penryn and Falmouth in Cornwall, a seat he held until 1835. From 1834 to 1835 he also served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to King William IV. He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1835. This was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1838 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer. Lord Charleville was also an advocate of homeopathy. He was a friend of Frederic Hervey Foster Quin, the first homeopathic physician in England, and also of the French artist and dandy Alfred d'Orsay. Charleville came increasingly into debt and was forced to sell off major parts of the family estates during the economic crisis in Ireland in the mid-1840s and eventually settled in Berlin. In 1821 in Florence, Lord Charleville married Harriet Charlotte Beaujolais Campbell, daughter of Colonel John Campbell of Shawfield and Islay and Lady Charlotte Bury, and sister of Walter Frederick Campbell.

He is regarded by many as the father of practical astronautics. He was involved in the development of the R-7 Rocket, Sputnik 1, and launching Laika and the first human being, Yuri Gagarin, into space. Although Korolev trained as an aircraft designer, his greatest strengths proved to be in design integration, organization and strategic planning. Arrested on a false official charge as a \"member of an anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary organization\" (which would later be reduced to \"saboteur of military technology\"), he was imprisoned in 1938 for almost six years, including some months in a Kolyma labour camp. Following his release he became a recognized rocket designer and a key figure in the development of the Soviet Intercontinental ballistic missile program. He later directed the Soviet space program and was made a Member of Soviet Academy of Sciences, overseeing the early successes of the Sputnik and Vostok projects including the first human Earth orbit mission by Yuri Alexeyvich Gagarin on 12 April 1961. Korolev's unexpected death in 1966 interrupted implementation of his plans for a Soviet crewed Moon landing before the United States 1969 mission.

Kennedy was intellectually disabled and was educated separately from other students; however, she was able to travel and to participate in social functions with her family. Kennedy was presented to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace in 1938. In her early young adult years, Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these and other difficulties, Kennedy's father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for Kennedy in 1941 when she was 23 years of age. The procedure failed, leaving Kennedy permanently incapacitated and rendering her unable to speak intelligibly. Kennedy spent most of the rest of her life being cared for at St. Coletta, an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The truth about her situation and whereabouts was kept secret for decades.

Esperance is an isolated town and it is not connected to the electricity grid. Before the installation of wind turbines, the electrical needs of Esperance town and surrounding districts were supplied solely from a diesel power station.

It is situated in the Laurentian Highlands north of the Saint Lawrence River, into which it drains via the Saguenay River through the Chicoutimi and Aux- Sables Rivers. The lake is fed by dozens of small rivers coming from the Laurentian Highlands. The three principal being the Pikauba, Cyriac and Aux- Ecorces Rivers. The towns on its shores include Lac -K\u00e9nogami, and H\u00e9bertville station.

As a result of the discovery of potential undersea oil reserves in 1968 in the area and the 1971 transfer of administrative control of the islands from the United States to Japan, the latter's sovereignty over the territory is disputed by both the People's Republic of China( PRC) and the Republic of China( also known as Taiwan). China claims the discovery and ownership of the islands from the 14th century, while Japan maintained ownership of the islands from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II. The United States administered the islands as part of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1945 until 1972, when the islands returned to Japanese control under the Okinawa Reversion Agreement between the United States and Japan. The islands are disputed between Japan and China and between Japan and Taiwan. Despite the diplomatic stalemate between mainland China and Taiwan, both governments agree that the islands are part of Taiwan as part of Toucheng Township in Yilan County. Japan administers and controls the Senkaku islands as part of the city of Ishigaki in Okinawa Prefecture. It does not acknowledge the claims of China nor Taiwan and has not allowed the Ishigaki administration to develop the islands. As a result of the dispute, the public is largely barred from approaching the uninhabited islands, which are about a seven- hour boat ride from Ishigaki.

Born in the Hunter Region at Sawyers Gully, near Maitland, New South Wales to parents George and Emily, Betteridge became blind at the age of two from suspected meningitis. Her mother took her to the Institution for Deaf and Dumb and Blind in 1904, but she was thought to be too young, and was sent home after a few months. She returned to the school in 1908, aged 7, to begin her education as the school's first deafblind student. In a story that echoes that of Helen Keller, Betteridge's teacher Roberta Reid fingerspelled words into her pupil's hand, until Betteridge made the connection between the words spelled and the objects she was touching. The breakthrough came when Reid spelled the word\" shoe\" while placing a shoe in Alice's hand. Her education then progressed rapidly, and in a few short months she knew 200 nouns and several verbs, including\" run, jump,\" and\" laugh,\" and soon began learning to read braille. In 1920 when she graduated, she was dux of the school. After graduating she remained at the school as a teacher for 9 years, before leaving Darlinghurst and returning to the family farm in Denman. In 1939, Betteridge married Will Chapman( also deafblind), with whom she had been corresponding by mail for some time, and moved to live with him in Melbourne.

The second son of the 26th king Seong, he assumed the throne after the death of his older brother and 27th king Wideok, but reigned only briefly before his own death. The Samguk Yusa describes him as the son of Wideok, but this is considered an error. His reign saw major inroads from the neighbouring Silla and Goguryeo kingdoms, with Silla occupying the present-day Seoul area and trading directly with China. Baekje's commercial positions along the Yellow Sea coast were now dominated by Goguryeo, trading outposts in China were lost to the Sui Dynasty's unification, and Japan's political centralization outgrew Baekje's influence as well. The decline of external commerce and influence led to infighting among the nobility. He was succeeded by his son Beop.\nDocument[2](Title: Jeonji of Baekje) Jeonji of Baekje (died 420) (r. 405\u2013420) was the eighteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. As the eldest son, he was confirmed as successor to King Asin, in 394. His queen was Lady Palsu of the Hae clan. Jeonji spent much of his youth in the Wa kingdom of Yamato Japan as hostage, going there in 397. Upon his father\u2019s death, he returned home to find that his uncle Seollye had murdered Hunhae, Asin's other brother, and usurped the throne. Hae Chung, an inhabitant of Hanseong, warned him not to enter the capital. Shortly thereafter, Seollye was killed and Jeonji made king. Presumably out of gratitude for this, Jeonji made several members of the Hae clan ministers, as well as marrying Lady Palso of the Hae clan. This put an end to the royal family\u2019s close ties to the Jin clan. The traditional dates of Jeonji's rule are based on the \"Samguk Sagi\". On the basis of more contemporaneous Chinese records, Best (1979) has suggested that the years 405\u2013414 are more plausible. According to the \"Samguk Sagi\", in 406 Baekje sent a tribute mission to the Chinese court of Eastern Jin. It is the first mention of such a mission in more than twenty years, and may indicate that the country had become more secure against Goguryeo. It would have been typical to send such an embassy to inform the Chinese court that a new king had taken power. However, this visit is not confirmed by Chinese sources.

Within the Korean peninsula, Biyu sought to strengthen Baekje\u2019s relationship with Silla, exchanging ambassadors in 433 and 434. Although Silla was a protectorate of Goguryeo at this time, Silla and Baekje allied themselves against Goguryeo (Naje Dongmaeng Hangul :\ub098\uc81c\ub3d9\ub9f9 Hanja :\u7f85\u6fdf\u540c\u76df).\n\nQuestion: Who is Hye Of Baekje's paternal grandfather?": [

After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a Thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic and ritualistic human sacrifice in honor of the goddess Kali. Executive producer and co-writer George Lucas made the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline.

In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about\" Gremlins\", Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America( MPAA) alter its rating system, which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new PG- 13 rating.

Reinald IV became the second Duke of Guelders and J\u00fclich upon his brother William's death in 1402 without heirs. Reinald, in conjunction with the Wittelsbach Counts of Holland, Hainaut and Zeeland, tried in vain to slow the emergence of Burgundy in the Netherlands area and in 1406 was unable to enforce old claims against Burgundy to Brabant- Limburg. He allied himself with Rupert, King of Germany, supporting his coronation in Aachen and remained closely connected with the House of Orl\u00e9ans.

It stars Miou-Miou, G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere. It is widely considered one of the most controversial movies in French cinema history due to its vulgarity, depiction of sexual acts, nudity, and moral ambiguity; however, Blier's later acclaim for the rest of his filmography made it a cult film for modern critics.

It centers on the monastery of Tibhirine, where nine Trappist monks lived in harmony with the largely Muslim population of Algeria, until seven of them were kidnapped and assassinated in 1996 during the Algerian Civil War. Largely a tale of a peaceful situation between local Christians and Muslims before becoming a lethal one due to external forces, the screenplay focuses on the preceding chain of events in decay of government, expansion of terrorism, and the monks' confrontation with both the terrorists and the government authorities that led up to their deaths. Principal photography took place at an abandoned monastery in Azrou, Morocco. The film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix, the festival's second most prestigious award.

Lovers of the Venetian aesthetic, the Ringlings chose the site overlooking Sarasota Bay for its vista, which reminded them of the lagoon of their favorite city. The name of the residence is Venetian for\" House of John\". The Ringlings had been renting the residence of Mary Louise and Charles N. Thompson on their extensive Shell Beach parcel, and decided to purchase some of the land to build a permanent winter headquarters that would include a residence on the bay and a museum for their extensive art and artifact collection. An art school was planned to abut the museum, but it never was built. Mable's rose garden was the first completed portion of the complex. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed Ca' d' Zan, the Residence of John and Mable Ringling on its list,\" Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places\". Architectural details of the house reflect influences ranging from the Venetian Doge's Palace to the tower of the first Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Items collected by the couple during their international travels were featured in the residence. The design of the residence was commissioned from New York architect Dwight James Baum in 1924 and it was built by the Sarasota developer Owen Burns. The work was completed in 1926, as the Florida boom collapsed and the bank failures that would lead to the crash of 1929 began. The original cost to build the home was$ 1.6 million. In 1982 the residence was listed as a contributing property to the Caples'- Ringlings' Estates Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Other contributing properties in the district include the Ellen and Ralph Caples residence, the John and Mable Ringling Museum, the Hester Ringling Lancaster Sandford residence and the Edith and Charles Ringling residence. The 1998 film\" Great Expectations\", directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, had portions filmed at Ca' d' Zan, which served as Ms. Dinsmoor's house, Paradiso Perduto.

In 1933, he earned a football scholarship to the University of Georgia( UGA) after a sports journalist had seen him high jumping in his backyard. Rather than high jumping, Towns specialized in the high hurdles, winning NCAA and AAU titles in the 120 y hurdles event in 1935. It was the beginning of a 60 race winning streak, lasting until 1937. In 1936, Towns was named to the American Olympic team, becoming the first Georgian to achieve this. During the Olympics in Berlin, Germany, Towns became the world record holder with 14.1, and he won the Olympic gold in 14.2. Also, he became the first Georgian to earn Olympic Gold. Shortly after the Games, he became the first hurdler under 14 seconds. At a race in Oslo, he dramatically improved the world record to 13.7 \u2013 a time that would stand until 1950. After college, Towns became Head Track and Field coach at UGA, a position he held until 1975. In 1991, he died of a heart attack in Athens, Georgia at age 77. He was honored at the University with the naming of the Spec Towns Track, and an annual meet called the Spec Towns Invitational. Towns was the official starter for the first- ever Peachtree Road Race on July 4, 1970.\n\nQuestion: Where was the founder of magazine Track & Field News born?": [

What evidence exists for Eleanor's early years suggests that while her parents were absent on Crusade between 1270 and 1274, she became very close to her paternal grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, with whom she continued to spend a good deal of time. She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain.

Vietnamese composer, Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, is one of the Vietnamese community's most famous composers today; composing famous songs before and even after the Vietnam War, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Since the early years of\" Paris By Night\", Th\u00fay Nga has been making single- composer videos dedicated to just a single composer. Starting in Paris By Night 64: \u00d0\u00eam V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Th\u00ednh Ph\u00f2ng however, Thuy Nga introduced the three- composer format. That trend continued in\" Paris By Night 66: Ng\u01b0\u1eddi T\u00ecnh v\u00e0 Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ngParis By Night 70: Thu CaParis By Night 74: Hoa B\u01b0\u1edbm Ng\u00e0y X\u01b0a Paris By Night 78: \u00d0\u01b0\u1eddng X\u01b0a\", and finally in\" Paris By Night 83: Nh\u1eefng Kh\u00fac H\u00e1t \u00c2n T\u00ecnh\". However, composer Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is an exception. After being beloved by many, and his songs are in a timeless label, Th\u00fay Nga thought that he should deserve the entire program just dedicated to him and his songs, in a program that was meant for three composers. \" Paris By Night 88\" is Th\u00fay Nga's third live- performance show, after\" Paris By Night 86\" and\" Paris By Night 87\", which was the PBN Talent Show. This is a trend that Th\u00fay Nga may be beginning to adapt, after years of having singers lip- sync on stage, a practice that is common and accepted in the Vietnamese music community. \" Paris By Night 88\" used famous songs that was originally performed in\" Paris By Night 28\" and\" Paris By Night 22\", which were part of the Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series. This is also director Alan Carter's first direction of\" Paris By Night\", in place of its regular director, Michael Watt after many years. Carter has been credited to many successful programs, including the 2007 Miss America Pageant, the 2007 CMT Music Awards, and the 2005 Miss Universe Pageant.\nDocument[2](Title: Pop Wansel) Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel (born April 27, 1988) is an American record producer, musician and songwriter from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As the son of Philadelphia soul icon Dexter Wansel, Pop grew up in the music industry and began writing and producing his own music at the age of ten, citing rapper Nas and Motown songwriting team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013 Holland as his early inspirations.

The song features American singer Beyonc\u00e9. The song was written by Gaga, Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Lazonate Franklin and Beyonc\u00e9. Inspired by her fear of suffocation, Gaga explained that the lyrics preferring relaxing on the dance floor to answering her lover's phone call are a metaphor, the phone calling her representing the fear of not having worked hard enough to succeed. Originally, Gaga wrote the song for Britney Spears, who recorded a demo. Musically, \"Telephone\" consists of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and a sampled voice of an operator announcing that the phone line is unreachable. Beyonc\u00e9 appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.\nDocument[4](Title: Song dynasty) The Song dynasty is divided into two distinct periods, Northern and Southern. During the Northern Song (Chinese: \u5317\u5b8b; 960 -- 1127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now Kaifeng) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China. The Southern Song (Chinese: \u5357\u5b8b; 1127 -- 1279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of its northern half to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in the Jin -- Song Wars. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the Yangtze and established its capital at Lin'an (now Hangzhou). Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional ``birthplace of Chinese civilization ''along the Yellow River, the Song economy was still strong, as the Southern Song Empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land. The Southern Song dynasty considerably bolstered its naval strength to defend its waters and land borders and to conduct maritime missions abroad. To repel the Jin, and later the Mongols, the Song developed revolutionary new military technology augmented by the use of gunpowder. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols, who took control of northern China, maintaining uneasy relations with the Southern Song. M\u00f6ngke Khan, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, died in 1259 while besieging the city of Chongqing. His younger brother Kublai Khan was proclaimed the new Great Khan, though his claim was only partially recognized by the Mongols in the west. In 1271, Kublai Khan was proclaimed the Emperor of China. After two decades of sporadic warfare, Kublai Khan's armies conquered the Song dynasty in 1279. The Mongol invasion led to a reunification under the Yuan dynasty (1271 -- 1368).\nDocument[5](Title: Honorific nicknames in popular music) Artist Title Country Source Laura Canales Queen of Tejano United States Mariah Carey Queen of Pop United States Songbird Supreme Queen of Christmas Roberto Carlos The King of Latin Music Brazil Carlos do Carmo King of Fado Portugal Ceca The Queen Serbia Ray Charles The Genius United States The High Priest of Soul Clifton Chenier King of Zydeco United States Cher Goddess of Pop United States Queen of Reinvention Queen of Comebacks Queen of Camp Jacky Cheung God of Song Hong Kong Leslie Cheung Gor Gor (Big / Elder Brother) Hong Kong Jay Chou King of Chinese Pop Taiwan Ciara Princess of Crunk & B United States Eric Clapton God United Kingdom Slowhand Kelly Clarkson The Original American Idol United States Pop Princess Queen of Covers George Clinton Father of P - Funk United States Keyshia Cole Princess of Hip Hop Soul United States Sam Cooke King of Soul United States Alice Cooper Godfather of Shock Rock United States Celia Cruz Queen of Salsa Cuba Dick Curless Baron of Country Music United States Miley Cyrus Teen Queen United States\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Thru Your Phone?": [

He is best known as the father of Ulysses S. Grant and the one who introduced Ulysses to military life at West Point. Jesse was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania and was one of seven children. He was a self-made man who rose from poverty to become a somewhat wealthy merchant. At age five, Jesse's family moved to Ohio and settled in the . Unable to support all his children Jesse's father arranged for his apprenticeship at farms and tanneries during his youth. Jesse married Hannah Simpson Grant and they became the parents of three boys and three girls, with Ulysses being their oldest. Raised in a poor family that was forced to split up and having to work at an early age, Jesse persistently encouraged his sons in the ways of education, industry and hard work, his methods sometimes testing his father-son relationship with Ulysses. As a young man he worked for and came to know Owen Brown and soon acquired strong abolitionist sympathies. Jesse was known to be outspoken, had strong opinions about politics and often boasted about his son, often referring to him as \"my Ulysses\". Originally a Jacksonian, Jesse eventually broke with the Democrats as he developed anti-slavery leanings, and for a time wrote a number of controversial editorials in support of abolition and about other issues, including Ulysses at Shiloh. He became involved in local politics and was elected Mayor in Georgetown and later, Bethel, both in Ohio. During the American Civil War Jesse and his two partners became involved in cotton speculation and personally prevailed upon his son Ulysses, now a Commanding General, requesting permits to deal in cotton in Grant's district, causing serious complications. Soon after the war Jesse stood next to his son Ulysses while he was sworn in as President, thereafter becoming a frequent visitor to the White House, while living out his final years in Covington, Kentucky. Much has been learned about the earlier years of his son Ulysses from letters between the two and other material relating to Jesse's background and business.\n\nQuestion: Where did Ulysses S.

His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook. Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, \"Marie from Sunny Italy\", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" in 1911. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever. \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also \"flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania. \" Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to \"reach the heart of the average American,\" whom he saw as the \"real soul of the country.\" In doing so, said Walter Cronkite, at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he \"helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives.\" He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including \"Alexander's Ragtime BandEaster ParadePuttin' on the RitzCheek to CheekWhite ChristmasHappy HolidayAnything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". His Broadway musical and 1943 film \"This is the Army\", with Ronald Reagan, had Kate Smith singing Berlin's \"God Bless America\" which was first performed in 1938. Berlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including The Andrews Sisters, Perry Como, Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Cher, Diana Ross, Bing Crosby, Sarah Vaughan, Ruth Etting, Fanny Brice, Marilyn Miller, Rudy Vall\u00e9e, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day, Jerry Garcia, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Buble, Lady Gaga, and Christina Aguilera.

It was written as a tribute to Filipino resistance during the Japanese occupation in World War II. During the war, Japanese troops in the Philippines attempted to popularize self- glorifying songs such as\" Chichi Yo Anata Wa Tsuyokatta Father, You Were Brave\" in English). Locals resisted these efforts, preferring instead to sing\" God Bless the Philippines\" to the tune of Berlin's\" God Bless America\" as a show of national pride. Berlin himself gave the first performance of\" Heaven Watch the Philippines\" in Tolosa, Leyte in 1946, in front of an audience that included Sergio Osme\u00f1a and Carlos P. Romulo. Berlin was touring U.S. military bases with a stage production of\" This Is the Army\", in 1945. During a stop in the Philippines, he heard children in Leyte singing the song\" God Bless America\"( which he had written in 1918 and had revised in 1938) with the lyric\" God Bless the Philippines\". Touched by that and feeling that they might like a song of their own, he composed\" Heaven Watch the Philippines\", trying to combine the spiritual quality of\" God Bless America\" with their feeling for America and desire to be free. He taught the song to school children in Leyte and sang the song in the finale of the show when\" This Is the Army\" opened in Leyte. Berlin had donated the\" God Bless America\" royalties to the Boy Scouts of America, and he presented the rights to\" Heaven Watch the Philippines\" to the Commonwealth of the Philippines with the instruction that if they ever sold the song in the Philippines for profit, the proceeds were to be given to the Boy and Girl Scouts of the Philippines. In a 1987 interview with\" Playboy\", Imelda Marcos falsely claimed that Berlin had written\" Heaven Watch the Philippines\" specifically for her. When asked about her claim, the 99- year- old Berlin denied it outright.\n\nQuestion: When was the composer of song Hot Time In The Town Of Berlin born?": [

Born in Rome, he was the son of Ricciarda Malaspina, duchess of Massa and Carrara and Lorenzo Cybo, duke of Ferentillo who changed his name to Cybo- Malaspina, and a great- grandson of Pope Innocent VIII. His mother was the heir of the state of Massa and Carrara, which she had inherited from her father. In 1546, he challenged his mother for control of the duchy of Massa and Carrara. With the backing of Cosimo I de' Medici and Andrea Doria, he seized control by force in 1546. Soon after, his mother appealed to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Charles sent his forces to seize Massa while Giulio was away. In March 1546, Giulio married Peretta Doria( 1526 \u2013 1591), daughter of Tommaso and sister of Giannettino Doria. Giulio had been promised a large dowry, which he wanted to fund a return to power, but Andrea Doria refused, arguing that he'd already spent more than the dowry on Giulio's first attempt to seize the Duchy. At that time Andrea Doria was a Genoese admiral in the service of Emperor and King of Spain Charles V( with whom the petty Massese state had allied so far). After Doria refused to fund him, Giulio set a plot against him together with Ottobuono Fieschi, Ottobuono Fieschi and other Genoese refugees, also backed by the Strozzi family of Florence and Pope Paul III. The aim was to enter the city and kill Doria, the Spanish ambassador and other members of the Doria party. With the help of the pope and Piero Strozzi, the revolt should spread to the whole Italy, with the objective to expel the Spaniards from the country. The plot was discovered before its beginning and Cybo was arrested in Pontremoli. Despite an attempt to save him from his cousin Cosimo I of Tuscany, he was beheaded in Milan in May 1548. His body was buried in the Cathedral of Massa. At his mother's death in 1553, the states of Massa and Carrara were ultimately inherited by his brother Alberico I Cybo- Malaspina, Prince of Massa.\nDocument[5](Title: Rose of Turaida) Maija( 1601 \u2013 1620), known as Rose of Turaida( sometimes Rose of Sigulda) was a murdered girl whose grave, in the grounds of Turaida Castle in Latvia, is still much visited.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Lorenzo Cybo's mother?": [

The film is an Italian\u2013American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises, and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel \"The Hoods\", it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third film of Leone's \"Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", which includes \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) and \"Duck, You Sucker!\" (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement.

In addition to being known for her film career, she received notoriety for being involved in several scandals throughout her career. Raised in Portland, Oregon, Carmen began acting in Hollywood at age 15, eventually performing with Keystone Studios. She first garnered public attention for her involvement in a statutory rape case involving herself and a 35-year-old automobile dealer in Los Angeles, but the charges against him were ultimately dropped as she could not concretely prove her age. Carmen resumed her career, appearing in several films throughout the 1910s, including a small role in D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), followed by leads in \"American Aristocracy\" (1916) opposite Douglas Fairbanks, and in Frank Lloyd's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1917). She also starred as Cosette in Lloyd's adaptation of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (also 1917). In 1918, she married film director Roland West. Carmen made her final film appearance in West's horror film \"The Bat\" (1926). In December 1935, Carmen garnered significant media coverage following the death of actress Thelma Todd, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the garage of Carmen and West's Pacific Palisades home. Carmen became embroiled in the investigation after she claimed to have seen Todd on Hollywood Boulevard hours after the time police determined Todd had died. A grand jury ultimately ruled Todd's death accidental, with the consensus that she had inadvertently caused her own death by running her car inside the garage to warm herself after West locked her out of the home; Todd and West had been engaged in a romantic affair at the time.

Michael was fourth-in-line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line and, in 1894, after the death of his father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir presumptive. The birth of Nicholas's son Alexei in 1904 moved Michael back to second-in-line, but Alexei was gravely-ill with hemophilia and Michael suspected the boy would die, leaving him as heir. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel to avoid scandal but this did not deter Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple's only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought Natalia to St. Petersburg where she was shunned by society. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying Natalia in the hope that he would be removed from the line of succession. Michael and Natalia left Russia to live in exile abroad in France, Switzerland and England. After the outbreak of World War I, Michael returned to Russia, assuming command of a cavalry regiment. When Nicholas abdicated on , Michael was named as his successor instead of Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He was never confirmed as Emperor and, following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father-in-law of Prince Feodor Alexandrovich Of Russia?": [

Taxi! is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring James Cagney and Loretta Young. The film includes two famous Cagney dialogues, one of which features Cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in Yiddish, and the other when Cagney is speaking to his brother's killer through a locked closet, Come out and take it, you dirty yellow- bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door! The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough- guy- dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film. In a lengthy and memorable sequence, the scene culminates with Raft and his partner winning the dance contest against Cagney and Young, after which Cagney slugs Raft and knocks him down. As in\" The Public Enemy\"( 1931), several scenes in\" Taxi!\" involved the use of live machine gun bullets. After a few of the bullets narrowly missed Cagney's head, he outlawed the practice in his future films. In the film they see a fictitious Warner Bros. movie at the cinema called\" Her Hour of Love\" in which Cagney cracks a joke about the film's leading man's appearance( an unbilled cameo by Warners contract player Donald Cook, who had played Cagney's brother in\" The Public Enemy\") saying,\" his ears are too big\".

He would thus have been the principal rival to Henry's daughter Matilda to inherit the throne after Henry's death. However, he was not considered as a candidate for the English crown. Several historians have taken the view that he was passed over because of mental deficiency; hence his soubriquet \"William the Simple\". Though widely argued, this has never been clearly substantiated. William was at first groomed to inherit the comital thrones of Blois and Chartres, and was designated count shortly before his father's departure on his second crusade in 1102. However he was soon removed from wide-ranging comital duties by his mother, because of his erratic behaviour. He once assaulted and threatened to kill the Bishop of Chartres over a jurisdictional dispute. So, when her second son Theobald came of age, around 1107, Adela elevated him to the position of count of Blois-Chartres, and forced William to retire to his wife's lands in Sully.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy born?": [

She was the child of Rubens and Eliza Burd Patterson Peale, the only daughter among seven children, and was the granddaughter of Charles Willson Peale. She was among the last members of the Peale family to paint professionally, studying with her uncle Rembrandt and with Thomas Sully in Philadelphia, and was enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. She produced mainly portraits and still lifes, many of which featured flowers. Today her work may be seen at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Sheldon Museum of Art, and the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, among other museums. She maintained a greenhouse at the Peale family home. The papers and diaries of Mary Jane Peale are located in the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, PA, and include both original diaries and correspondence as well as photocopies. The contents of the collection is material related to Rubens and Eliza Peale, and the Peale family. Microfilm copies of this collection can be found in the Library of the Smithsonian Institution. She is credited with teaching her father to paint, after his retirement, and there is evidence that some of the works attributed to him( such as\" Wedding Cake, Wine, Almonds, and Raisins\" and\" Rubens Peale in His Studio\") may have instead been collaborative creations between the two. After Rubens died in 1865, Mary Jane finished the paintings he had been working on. In her obituary, the New York Times said,\" For a number of years she made her home in this city, but for several years had resided in Schuylkill County, at her place,\" Riverside,\" the home of her childhood, on whose walls hung many ancient paintings by members of her family and portraits of Revolutionary heroes painted by her grandfather.\"\nDocument[4](Title: Karl Dane) Karl Dane (born Rasmus Karl Therkelsen Gottlieb, 12 October 1886 \u2013 14 April 1934) was a Danish-American comedian and actor known for his work in American films, mainly of the silent film era. He became a star after co-starring in one of the most successful silent films of all time, \"The Big Parade\" (1925), directed by King Vidor and starring John Gilbert. After signing with MGM in 1926, he appeared in supporting roles in several popular silent films before teaming up with George K. Arthur to form the successful comedy duo Dane & Arthur. They appeared in a number of silent, short comedy films and toured the vaudeville circuit. At the peak of his career, Dane earned $1500 a week. As the film industry transitioned from silent to sound films in the late 1920s, Dane's thick Danish accent became problematic. By 1930, Dane was relegated to less prominent roles, often with little to no dialogue. Later that year, MGM terminated his contract. Dane attempted to pursue work in other fields but found no success. Broke and despondent, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in April 1934. Karl Dane's rapid career decline, depression and subsequent death have been cited as an extreme example of the fate that befell many silent film stars who were unable to make the transition from silent to sound films.\nDocument[5](Title: Mrs. Dane's Defence (1933 film)) Mrs. Dane's Defence is a 1933 British drama film directed by A.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Klementyna Hoffmanowa) Klementyna Hoffmanowa, born Klementyna Ta\u0144ska (23 November 1798 \u2013 21 September 1845) was a Polish novelist, translator, teacher and activist. She considered herself primarily a writer, and was the first woman in Poland to support herself from writing and teaching, as well as one of Poland's first writers of children's literature. She made her debut in 1819 with a moralizing treatise \"A Souvenir After a Good Mother\". In 1820s, she edited a popular magazine for children and published several children books, that have won a wide audience over several generations. She published a number of novels, including \"The Letters of El\u017cbieta Rzeczycka to her friend Urszula\" (1824) and \"The Diary of Countess Francoise Krasinska\" (1825), the latter being Hoffmanowa's best known work, translated into several languages, and described as one of the first Polish psychological novels. Hoffmanowa raised the postulate of economic self-empowerment of women. She believed that the first step for women to achieve independence should be getting an education and preparing for paid work. However, she held conservative views on the role of women, and referred to national and Catholic values. In 1826, her candidacy for membership in the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning was submitted, but she was not accepted as a woman. She remained unmarried until the age of thirty, long by the standards of her time for a woman, and only in 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman. Until then she used her maiden name. Though writing was her main and most preferred activity, she also worked as a teacher, at the time called the \"inspector\" and \"visitator\" of female schools, and lecturer in moral science at the Governess' Institute in Warsaw (1826\u20131831). She educated a number of young women, some of whom in later years became writers and teachers themselves. Hoffmanowa was mentioned with respect and appreciation by some of her students. In turn, her pupil Narcyza \u017bmichowska criticized Hoffmanowa's conservatism. During the Poland's November Uprising against the Russian Empire, Hoffmanowa was a co-creator and chairman of the Union of Patriotic Charity of the Varsovians and carried the help to the wounded soldiers. After the fall of the uprising in 1831, she and her husband fled to Paris, where their house became the meeting place of the Polish political refugees. In Paris, Hoffmanowa was active in the Charity Association of Polish Ladies and the Literary Society, and was called \"the Mother of the Great Emigration\u201d. She was friends with Chopin and Mickiewicz. She died of breast cancer at the age of 46 and was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery.\nDocument[2](Title: Gisela Januszewska) Gisela Januszewska (also known by surnames Kuhn, Rosenfeld and Roda; 22 January 1867 \u2013 2 March 1943) was an Austrian physician. Having earned her degree in Switzerland, she briefly worked in Germany before becoming the first female physician in the Bosnian town of Banja Luka.

She is known for her work in developing school libraries in Oslo, and for creating the Norwegian name\" Ole Brumm\" for the character Winnie- the- Pooh when she produced the first Norwegian translation of the book\" Winnie- the- Pooh\" in 1932, six years after it was published in English. Deinboll was born in Hamar. After obtaining her\" examen artium\" in 1916 and graduating from normal school in 1918 in Hamar, she worked at the children's and school department of the Oslo Public Library from 1918 to 1963, heading it from 1921 onward. She also worked at the Brooklyn Public Library in New York City in 1921, and at the public library in Sarpsborg in 1947. In 1927 she married August Deinboll( 1880 \u2013 1975), who was the father of the Norwegian cartoonist Tore Deinboll( 1910 \u2013 1988). Deinboll received the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1963.\nDocument[4](Title: Bronis\u0142awa Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowska) Bronis\u0142awa Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowska (1886 \u2013 August 26, 1953 Paris) was of Russian Jewish origin. Her father Salomon (Simeon) Kliatchkin (1858\u20131916) was the owner of the first credit bureau (credit reference agency) in the Russian Empire. Her mother was Helena Kliatchkin (n\u00e9e Bajenov; 1886\u20131953). She had nine siblings; one died in childhood, three in Joseph Stalin's purges, one survived in Russia and four survived in exile in France. The family's suffering under Stalin are recorded in a film shown on Russian television in 2008, \"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0430The history of a family which was a witness to its epoch\"). She studied medicine in Paris before 1914. At this time she was married to her first husband, , a lawyer. Berenson was the defender in the Tsarist courts of Felix Dzerzhinsky, who was to be the founder of the Cheka, the first Soviet secret police agency. At the outbreak of the First World War she volunteered to work as a nurse at the Hotel Continental in Paris, now the Westin Paris - Vend\u00f4me. She nursed Pierre Laurent (1892-1935), a young French officer, the son of Charles Laurent, a French senior civil servant. Pierre was sent to join the military mission of General Lavergne in Saint Petersburg, then called Petrograd. Lavergne had succeeded General Henri Niessel as head of the French military mission. There Pierre was responsible for obtaining information about the Russian army. Bronis\u0142awa, back in Petrograd, helped him. After Vladimir Lenin arrived in his sealed train their priority was to prevent him leading Russia into an armistice with Germany. They were able to obtain telegrams to Lenin appearing to show that he was supported by German funds. They presented this information to the Provisional government headed by Prince Georgy Lvov on the 24th of June, but no action was taken at that meeting. However, Justice Minister Pereverzev investigated further and was able to obtain a fuller set of 66 telegrams (Lyandres). These proved the existence of an import business from Sweden run by the Bolsheviks, but it was the evidence of contact with known German agents which was damming. The July Days (3 \u2013 7 July) were the Bolshevik\u2019s second attempt at a coup. On the 4th of July Pereverzev shared the information gained from the telegrams with General Peter Polovtsov, commander of the Petrograd garrison, some newspaper editors and other ministers. According to Sean McMeekin, revulsion among the soldiers at the knowledge that Lenin was in contact with the enemy brought them on the side of the provisional government and ended the coup attempt. The next day Pereverzev\u2019s men raided the Kschessinskaya mansion where the Bolsheviks were based. Many Bolsheviks were arrested and Lenin fled to Finland. According to McMeekin, recently opened Russian archives contain evidence, from the investigation triggered by the telegrams, that the import business was a front for laundering money being sent by the German government to the Bolsheviks. We can suppose, then, that Pierre and Bronia\u2019s activities, helped to postpone the Bolshevik revolution from July to the \u201cOctober Revolution\u201d some four months later. A year after the October Revolution, in October 1918, Bronis\u0142awa escaped on a false French passport under the name of \"Jeanne-Liliane Lalande\". While in Petrograd she had met Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski, a Polish officer. At considerable personal risk to herself she was able to persuade the Cheka to release him from Taganka Prison in Moscow to house arrest at her house. They both escaped to Poland, and he became her second husband. They had one daughter, Zuzanna, later Susanna Vernon (11 August 1920 \u2013 3 August 2011). Susanna was the goddaughter of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, the main leader of Poland between the wars, who was a friend of her father. In the summer the family lived in the manor house of Bobowa. They famously had good, if distant, relations with the Hasidic Jews of Bobowa (Bobov) and the Bobov Rebbe Ben Zion Halberstam. The rest of the year they lived in their official residence; a hunting lodge in \u0141azienki Park in the center of Warsaw. When in 1938 General Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski was sent to Rome as Polish ambassador to the government of Benito Mussolini, Bronis\u0142awa accompanied him. When Italy joined the war with the other Axis powers in 1940 they fled together to New York. In 1942 he committed suicide. She and her daughter were looked after for some weeks by Arthur Szyk, the famous cartoonist and anti-Nazi activist. Tatiana Yacovleff du Plessix Liberman was another friend who, with her husband, Alexander Liberman, helped Zuzanna find work at \"Vogue\" magazine and, later, at the United Nations, where she became one of the first simultaneous interpreters. Bronis\u0142awa returned to Europe after the war and died in Paris in August 1953 of the complications of a gall bladder operation. She is buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery under her assumed name; \"Jeanne-Liliane Lalande\" in the Laurent family tomb. As explained in the Russian film mentioned above, after half a century without contact, twenty years after Bronis\u0142awa's death, the Russian and French descendants of Salomon Kliatchkin were re-united.\nDocument[5](Title: Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest) Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest, later van Aardenne- Ehrenfest,( Vienna, October 28, 1905 \u2013 Dordrecht, November 29, 1984) was a Dutch mathematician.

He was born on 24 September 1577 as the son of George I, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Magdalene of Lippe. In 1604 he inherited a part of Hessen-Marburg after the death of Louis IV of Hesse-Marburg who was childless. The other half went to Maurice of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), but since Maurice was a Calvinist, Ludwig claimed a right on the whole of Hesse-Marburg. Lutheran professors of the University of Marburg who refused to convert to Calvinism founded in 1607 the University of Gie\u00dfen which was named \"Ludoviciana\". This led to a conflict during the Thirty Years' War, between Louis V, who stood on the side of the Emperor, and Maurice, who was on the side of the Protestants. Hesse-Darmstadt suffered severely from the ravages from the Swedes during the conflict. The Landgrave died in 1626 and he was succeeded by George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1722, Johann Georg Liebknecht, an astronomer at the University of Gie\u00dfen, named a star, which he thought was a planet, Sidus Ludoviciana after Ludwig V.\n\nQuestion: Who is Louis Viii, Landgrave Of Hesse-Darmstadt's paternal grandmother?": [

His mainstream career lasted only four years, but he is widely regarded as one of the most influential guitarists in history and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\". Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at age 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, but he was discharged the following year. He moved to Clarksville, Tennessee soon after and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey JoePurple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and his third and final studio album \"Electric Ladyland\" reached number one in the US in 1968; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his only number-one album. He was the world's highest-paid performer, and he headlined the Woodstock festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. He died from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at age 27. Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and he was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz tone, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of \"Rolling Stone\" writes: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\" In 1967, readers of \"Melody Maker\" voted Hendrix the Pop Musician of the Year, and \"Rolling Stone\" declared him the Performer of the Year in 1968. \"Disc and Music Echo\" magazine honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969, and \"Guitar Player\" named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year in 1970. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the band's three studio albums among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and ranked Hendrix the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.\nDocument[4](Title: The Suicide Club, or the Adventures of a Titled Person) The Suicide Club, or the Adventures of a Titled Person is a 1981 Soviet three- part television adventure film directed by Yevgeny Tatarsky.

He was also an accomplished poet. Appointed to the Lan Na throne by his father King Bayinnaung of Burma, Nawrahta dutifully contributed to his half-brother King Nanda's debilitating war effort against Siam (1584\u201395). He declared independence in 1597 after having defeated a 1595\u201396 invasion by Lan Xang on his own. From 1599 onward, he was forced to deal with a Lan Xang backed rebellion in Nan, and a Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai and Chiang Saen.

He directed his first full-length title, Florencio Parravicini's comedy vehicle, \"Noches de carnaval\", later that year.

The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.

Blanca married Sancho III of Castile, regent of Castile (subject to his father Alfonso VII) on February 4, 1151 in Carri\u00f3n de los Condes, Palencia, after travelling from Calahorra, Logro\u00f1o, in January. The marriage was arranged to insure closer ties between Le\u00f3n-Castile and Navarre. As was traditional, Blanca confirmed documents with her husband, so her activity may be traced until 1155. On November 11, 1155 she gave birth to the future king Alfonso VIII. There appears to be no record of her activities after December 1155, and she died on August 12, 1156. The cause of her death seems to have been complications of a new pregnancy, a child named Garc\u00eda. In addition, she had other children buried in the church of San Pedro in Soria, although they are not identified. That her death was caused by a pregnancy is recorded in an epitaph engraved on her tomb, however, the engraving did not survive a sixteenth-century reconstruction of the royal tombs in N\u00e1jera. Her sarcophagus lid was preserved, and it represents the queen's deathbed with members of the court, including her husband, mourning her passing. Blanca was buried in the pantheon of the Navarrese kings in the monastery called Santa Mar\u00eda la Real of N\u00e1jera, to which Sancho made donations on her behalf. The sarcophagus of the queen is regarded as a primary example of the ability to express human emotions in visual images in the 12th century.

Delacroix, who was of French origin, met the king in Paris as a young girl, when she was only 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living from prostitution. They soon embarked upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title,\" baronne de Vaughan\"( Baroness Vaughan). Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed- induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited from the king's income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo( \u201c The Queen of the Congo \u201d). She and Leopold married in a religious ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income \u2013 all of which turned her into a multimillionaire. For years, the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case.

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino, but which reduced papal finances. In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter's Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther's 95 Theses. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal Bull of 1520, \"Exsurge Domine\", condemned Martin Luther's condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult. He borrowed and spent money without circumspection. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, \"Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it. \" Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Leo also reorganised the Roman University, and promoted the study of literature, poetry and antiquities. He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy.\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Marguerite De Navarre or Leo Lankinen?": [

She married Henry in 1485 after his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, which marked the end of the Wars of the Roses. Together, Elizabeth and Henry had seven, possibly eight, children. After the death of her father, King Edward IV, Elizabeth's brothers the \"Princes in the Tower\" disappeared, their fate uncertain. Although the 1484 act of Parliament \"Titulus Regius\" declared the marriage of her parents, Edward and Elizabeth Woodville, invalid, she and her sisters were subsequently welcomed back to court by Edward's brother, King Richard III. As a Yorkist princess, the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster, but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry Elizabeth before he arrived in England. This may well have contributed to the hemorrhaging of Yorkist support for Richard. Although Elizabeth seems to have played little part in politics, her marriage appears to have been a successful one. Her eldest son Arthur, Prince of Wales, died at age 15 in 1502, and three other children died young. Her second, and only surviving, son became King Henry VIII of England, while her daughters Mary and Margaret became queen of France and queen of Scotland, respectively; many modern royals, including Elizabeth II, trace their line through Margaret.\nDocument[5](Title: Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond) Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond (Welsh: \"Edmwnd Tudur\", 11 June 1430 \u2013 3 November 1456, also known as Edmund of Hadham), was the father of King Henry VII of England and a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd, North Wales. Born to Owen Tudor and the dowager queen Catherine of Valois, Edmund was half-brother to Henry VI of England. Edmund was raised for several years by Katherine de la Pole, and Henry took an interest in Edmund's upbringing, granting him a title and lands once he came of age. Both Edmund and his brother, Jasper, were made advisers to the King as they were his remaining blood relatives. The brothers were made the senior earls in the royal court and had influential positions in the Parliament of England. Edmund was also granted Baynard's Castle, London and ran a successful estate. He was married to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, after her first marriage was annulled. Prior to the start of the Wars of the Roses, Edmund liaised with Richard of York and supported him when the King fell ill during 1453 and 1454. After war began in 1455, York sent Edmund to uphold the authority of the King in South Wales. While he was there, York was overthrown by the King and in retaliation, Yorkist forces were sent to engage those of Tudor's in South Wales.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \" Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for\" his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/ native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry\" at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film,\" The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's\" Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\"( 1925). \" The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its\" social critique\" and\" because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films,\" Wara Wara\"( 1930) and\" Hacia la Gloria\"( 1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and\" Wara Wara\" remains\" the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent- film era\". He also made short documentary films,\" before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is\" Amerindia\"( 1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico.

Lennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism.

After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist. Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant- garde albums, his first solo LP\" John Lennon/ Plastic Ono Band\", and the international top 10 singles\" Give Peace a ChanceInstant Karma! Imagine\" and\" Happy Xmas( War Is Over)\". Lennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. After moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three- year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration\" Double Fantasy\". He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release. By 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, and in 2008,\" Rolling Stone\" ranked him the fifth- greatest singer of all time.

On the death of his father's cousin Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers, the family took the name \"Fox Pitt-Rivers\" on May 25, 1880. In 1878, Fox-Pitt was granted a patent on a light bulb with a platinum-iridium filament. The patent also describes a system for power distribution using incandescent lamps in parallel. On 12 December 1879, Charles Francis Brush founded the Anglo-American Electric Light Company Ltd in the UK, and in the same year acquired the patent rights to produce the Lane-Fox incandescent lamp. On 24 March 1880, he founded a new company, Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation, which took over the previous one. About 1880, Fox-Pitt is said to have successfully experimented with charred plant fibres as the filament material. That was about the same time as the development of the light bulb with carbon filament by Edison in the United States. By 1883, Fox-Pitt had obtained further patents. Fox-Pitt wrote books on the philosophy of science, education, and social problems. He was temporarily Vice-President of the Moral Education League and organized the International Moral Education Congress.

His older siblings included Wilhelmina (later Margravine of Bayreuth), Frederick II (later King of Prussia), Friedrike Louise (later Margravine of Ansbach) and Louisa Ulrika (later Queen of Sweden). Augustus was favored by his father over Frederick and popular at the Prussian court. When his brother Frederick became king in 1740, Augustus became heir presumptive and moved into the Fredrick's former residence, the Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin. When his older sister Louisa Ulrika married the King of Sweden in 1744, she founded the Ordre de l'Harmonie, of which Augustus was one of the first recipients. Augustus served his brother as a general in the War of the Austrian Succession, and distinguished himself in the Battle of Hohenfriedberg. But in the Seven Years' War, owing to the fatal retreat of Zittau during the Battle of Kolin in 1757, he incurred the wrath of his brother the King, and withdrew from the army. This conflict between the two brothers led to a correspondence, which was published in 1769. Augustus died suddenly in 1758 at Oranienburg, according to some of \"a broken heart\", in reference to his brother Frederick II's harsh treatment of him for his incompetent military leadership in the Battle of Kolin.

In 131 BC he was elected consul along with Lucius Valerius Flaccus, the Flamen Martialis. Mucianus forbade his colleague to fight against Aristonicus and fined him for neglecting his sacred duties. The people remitted the fine but wished Flaccus to submit to his religious superior. Mucianus, nevertheless, went to fight Aristonicus, who had occupied the kingdom of Pergamum, after it had been left to Rome in the will of Attalus III. He was the first Pontifex Maximus to voluntarily leave Italy( whereas Scipio Nasica Serapio had been sent out of Italy by the Senate).

She first garnered public attention for her involvement in a statutory rape case involving herself and a 35-year-old automobile dealer in Los Angeles, but the charges against him were ultimately dropped as she could not concretely prove her age.

Carmen became embroiled in the investigation after she claimed to have seen Todd on Hollywood Boulevard hours after the time police determined Todd had died. A grand jury ultimately ruled Todd's death accidental, with the consensus that she had inadvertently caused her own death by running her car inside the garage to warm herself after West locked her out of the home; Todd and West had been engaged in a romantic affair at the time.

Taxi! is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring James Cagney and Loretta Young. The film includes two famous Cagney dialogues, one of which features Cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in Yiddish, and the other when Cagney is speaking to his brother's killer through a locked closet, Come out and take it, you dirty yellow- bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door! The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough- guy- dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film. In a lengthy and memorable sequence, the scene culminates with Raft and his partner winning the dance contest against Cagney and Young, after which Cagney slugs Raft and knocks him down. As in\" The Public Enemy\"( 1931), several scenes in\" Taxi!\" involved the use of live machine gun bullets. After a few of the bullets narrowly missed Cagney's head, he outlawed the practice in his future films.

He graduated from the Soviet VGIK film school in 1975 after which he started working at the Riga Film Studio. He became a director in 1979. Podnieks' first film \"Cradle\" won an award at the Dok Leipzig festival. In 1981, his film \"The Brothers Kokar\" took the first prize at the Kiev Youth Festival. In the same year, his film \"Constellation of Riflemen\" won honours in the 17th All State Festival in Leningrad and the Latvian Komsomol prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the Soviet Union. Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie \" 'Is It Easy to Be Young?\". The film with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks talked to youngsters later convicted for criminal actions. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled \"Hello, do you hear us?\". It showed civil unrest in Uzbekistan, survivors of the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, striking workers in Yaroslavl and former residents returning to Chernobyl. The first film in the series, \"Red Hot\", was awarded the Prix Italia and the Peabody Award. Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of national identity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. His \"Homeland\" was an account of folk festivals in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the attempted coup by Soviet forces in Riga. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend Andris Slapi\u0146\u0161 was killed and Gvido Zvaigzne, another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries. This was captured on video and shown as an addition to \"Homeland\" and later as an introduction for the revised version of this film.

Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film \"Come Back, Africa\", which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \"Pata Pata\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album \"An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba\". She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several independence celebrations. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song \"Soweto Blues\", written by her former husband Hugh Masekela, was about the Soweto uprising. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with Nina Simone and Dizzy Gillespie, and appeared in the 1992 film \"Sarafina!\". She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy. Makeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several songs critical of apartheid, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President Nelson Mandela said that \"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\"\nDocument[3](Title: Princess Elizabeth of Toro) Princess Elizabeth Christobel Edith Bagaaya Akiiki of Toro (born 1936) is the \"Batebe\" (Princess Royal) of the Kingdom of Toro.

Like the feature- length 3- D films of the 1950s when they were originally released, it was projected by the polarized light method and viewed through gray Polaroid filters in viewers which, according to the film's poster, were\" scientifically designed by master craftsmen!\" Most theaters, however, presented it\" flat\", in 2- D. Although it is widely believed to have been filmed in Stereovision, Bob Furmanek, who oversaw the 2016 restoration, says this is a myth. It was shot full- frame with the original NaturalVision cameras used on\" Bwana Devil\". The center of the image was then extracted to create a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, in the manner of the then- current Superscope process. Unfortunately, it was poorly done, resulting in a large number of badly- framed shots; for example, the scene with the Flamenco dancers has a huge amount of headroom while their feet are cut off.

Born into a family of landed gentry, she attended finishing school in Krak\u00f3w and then studied art in Warsaw and in Vienna and Paris. Her work was recognized in the 1900 Paris Exposition and her\" Studium dziewczyny\"( Girls' Studio) was purchased by the National Museum in Krak\u00f3w. After 1889, the majority of her paintings were of her companion Maria Konopnicka. Dul\u0119bianka was active in the women's movement pressing for women to be admitted to the Krak\u00f3w Academy of Fine Arts and for the establishment of a gymnasium in Lviv for girls to gain access to higher education. She published articles and gave lectures on women's issues. Active in the fight for women's suffrage, she ran as a candidate in the 1908 election for the Parliament of Galicia, but was rejected because she was a woman. Undiscouraged, she continued to strive for social equality, Polish independence, and cooperation between Poles and Ukrainians. Dul\u0119bianka founded the Women's Electoral Committee to press for women's inclusion in the Lviv City Council, the Union of Women's Rights, the Men's League for the Defense of Women's Rights and the Women's Civic Work Committee. As the leader of the Civic Work Committee, she established kitchens for the poor, children's nurseries, and a club to care for street children and orphans.

Her journals, both fiction and domestic manuals, reached wide audiences from the 1820s through the 1850s. At times she shocked her audience as she tried to take on issues of both male dominance and white supremacy in some of her stories.

Sylvia Plath made reference to her grandmother by making \"Esther Greenwood\" the name of the heroine in her semi-autobiographical novel \"The Bell Jar\". The relationship between Plath and her daughter was a rather problematic and ambiguous one, for on the one hand they were exceptionally close to each other, and on the other hand Sylvia Plath often claimed that she hated her mother.

She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Her achievements included the development of the theory of \"radioactivity\" (a term she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals. While a French citizen, Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element she discovered \"polonium\", after her native country. Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Lydia Knott or Maria Dul\u0119bianka?": [

Often billed as \"America's Number One Song Stylist\", his other nicknames include \"Mr. RhythmOld Leather Lungs\", and \"Mr. Steel Tonsils\". His hits included \"That's My DesireThat Lucky Old SunMule TrainJezebelHigh NoonI BelieveHey Joe!The Kid's Last FightCool WaterRawhide\", and \"Lord, You Gave Me a Mountain\".

Corral\", and \"Blazing Saddles\", although his recordings were not charted as a country & western. Laine sang an eclectic variety of song styles and genres, stretching from big band crooning to pop, western-themed songs, gospel, rock, folk, jazz, and blues. He did not sing the soundtrack song for \"High Noon\", which was sung by Tex Ritter, but his own version (with somewhat altered lyrics, omitting the name of the antagonist, Frank Miller) was the one that became a bigger hit, nor did he sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with\u2014\"Champion the Wonder Horse\" (sung by Mike Stewart)\u2014but released his own, subsequently more popular, version.

It reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and remained there for two weeks, becoming the album's second number-one single, and Jackson's eighth number one entry on the chart. It also charted on the Hot R&B Singles, Hot Dance Club Play and Rhythmic chart at number one. \" Bad\" is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Duke Charles (later King Charles IX) took him in, believing he would be better off growing up at his court. In 1590, Gustav was expelled from King John's court because of excessive behavior in the taverns of Stockholm, which led to his mother's intervening on his behalf with a plea to the queen, Gunilla Bielke.

He was music director to Frederick William II of Prussia. He said, \"Heredity can tend to run out of ideas.\" Ernst Bach received training in music from his uncle, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and from another uncle in England, Johann Christian Bach. He was in London when Johann Christian Bach died there on New Year's Day, 1782. Ernst Bach remained in England until 1784 before returning via Holland to Germany. He held a few positions, namely those of \"Kapellmeister\" of Minden in 1786, and from 1788 to 1811 as \"Kapellmeister\" in Berlin with the blessing of King Friedrich Wilhelm II. Ernst Bach retired from his position after prince Heinrich, the brother of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III granted him a pension. Ernst Bach married twice. He had two daughters by his first wife, who died young, and a son by his second wife. When WFE's only son died in infancy, the event served to extinguish the long line of musical Bachs. At the unveiling of the Bach Monument in Leipzig on 23 April 1843, Ernst Bach met Robert Schumann. Schumann later described Ernst Bach as \"a very agile old gentleman of 84 years with snow-white hair and expressive features.\" One of Ernst Bach's most remarkable compositions was \"Dreyblatt,\" a concerto for piano involving six hands. He wrote it in such a way in that it was to be performed with one large male in the middle with a petite female on either side of him.

Fegelein joined a cavalry regiment of the Reichswehr in 1925 and transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933. He became a leader of an SS equestrian group, and was in charge of preparation for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. He tried out for the Olympic equestrian team himself but was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. In September 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, Fegelein commanded the SS \"Totenkopf Reiterstandarte\" (Death's-Head Horse Regiment). They were garrisoned in Warsaw until December. In May and June 1940, he participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (later renamed the \"Waffen-SS\"). For his service in these campaigns he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940. Units under his command on the Eastern Front in 1941 were responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 civilians during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation in the Byelorussian SSR. As commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" in 1943, he was involved in operations against partisans as well as defensive operations against the Red Army, for which he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze. After being seriously wounded in September 1943, Fegelein was reassigned by Heinrich Himmler to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS.

He was on duty at Hitler's \"F\u00fchrerbunker\" in Berlin in the closing months of the war, and was shot for desertion on 28 April 1945, two days before Hitler's suicide.

In 1922 he was elected the second President of the Republic of Poland following the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz. He was ousted by the May Coup d'\u00c9tat of 1926. While a student at the University of Warsaw, Wojciechowski worked for the Polish Socialist movement, which at the time was a major force in the Polish independence effort. He was arrested by czarist police in 1891, and again in 1892. Upon his release he moved to Zurich, then to Paris and finally to London. In England he helped publish the Polish Socialist periodical \"Przed\u015bwit\" (\u201cThe Dawn\u201d). Active in the socialist movement, he often travelled undercover to Russian Poland, and became friends with J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. He also studied the cooperative movement, and on returning to Poland legally in 1906 he spent time working to develop Polish cooperatives. During World War I he considered Imperial Germany to be Poland\u2019s main enemy.

During his presidency, Wojciechowski and his erstwhile friend military chief of staff Pi\u0142sudski disagreed on the political direction of the nation: Wojciechowski supported continued parliamentary government, while Pi\u0142sudski favoured a more authoritarian approach. In May 1926, due to the worsening economic issues of the country, Pi\u0142sudski staged the successful May Coup, after which Wojciechowski resigned from his post.\nDocument[4](Title: Antoni M\u0105czak) Antoni M\u0105czak (30 March 1928 in Lw\u00f3w \u2013 6 March 2003 in Warsaw) was a Polish historian specializing in the economic, political and social history of Poland and history of Europe.\nDocument[5](Title: T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa) T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa, born as Teodor Wy\u017cewski( 12 September 1862 \u2013 15 April 1917), was a writer, critic, and translator of Polish descent, born in Ka\u0142usik in the Russian sector of Poland near Kamieniec Podolski( \u041a\u0430\u043c'\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c- \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439, Ukraine), who emigrated to France in 1869. He was a leading exponent of Polish origin of the Symbolist movement in France. With \u00c9douard Dujardin he created\" La Revue wagn\u00e9rienne\" in 1885. In 1901, he founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mozart with Adolphe Boschot and Georges de Saint- Foix. He frequently contributed articles on European literature and music to the\" Revue des deux mondes\" and\" Le Temps\", among many other periodicals. His translation of Jacobus de Voragine's\" Golden Legend\" into modern French made it available to a wide audience once more. Wyzewa made his name with brilliant analyses of poems by St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. In\" La Revue wagn\u00e9rienne\" he put forward the idea of Wagnerian Art which heralded symbolism. He is also famous for his for his idea of the\" work of art of the future\", which, according to him, should have been a novel describing only the inner life of its author during a period no longer than a day. The idea, transferred by example of the novel\" Les lauriers sont coup\u00e9s\" by Wyzewa's friend \u00c9douard Dujardin, was fully realized by James Joyce in\" Ulysses\". Wyzewa was critical of Dujardin's novel though.

Henry first threatened to give Lower Lorraine to the second son Gothelo( not known for his courage or competency and who was perhaps mentally deficient). Godfrey rebelled and was imprisoned. Henry appointed Frederick of Luxembourg to succeed in Lower Lorraine. The date of Gothelo II's death has been disputed. The homonymy between father and son and the imprecision of the documents( including the fact that not all mention him) have made his role in the duchy of Lower Lorraine debatable.\nDocument[2](Title: Satyavati Devi (born 1905)) Satyavati Devi (28 February 1905 \u2013 26 October 2010) was an Indian freedom fighter and Gandhian.

A powerful magnate in south-western England , he was the first post-Conquest earl of Cornwall. Brian was born in about 1042, a son of Odo, Count of Penthi\u00e8vre. Brian joined in the Norman Conquest of England, along with his brothers Alan the Black (Alain le Noir), and Alan the Red.\nGodwine and Edmund, sons of Harold Godwinson, escaped after the Battle of Hastings to Leinster, where they were guests of Diarmait. In 1068 and 1069 Diarmait lent them the fleet of Dublin for attempted invasions of England. At midsummer in 1069 Brian and Alan led a force that defeated a raid by a fleet of 64 ships on the mouth of the River Taw in Devon. Later in the same year Brian and William fitz Osbern were sent to relieve sieges at Shrewsbury and Exeter by English forces rebelling against Norman lordship. They were too late to save the former but a sally by the defenders of Exeter drove the English into the path of Brian and William who \"punished their audacity with great slaughter\". After defeating Harold's sons, Brian's forces went north to counter the rebellion by Eadric the Wild, while William the Conqueror's army travelled west; the two armies joined and won the Battle of Stafford. Brian received grants of land in Suffolk and Cornwall, although the first mention of him as Earl of Cornwall was not made until 1140, by his nephew Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond who had been given the same title by King Stephen and may have been trying to improve the legitimacy of his new rank. Brian's name is often associated with the construction of Launceston Castle. Brian may have left England soon after the battles of 1069, or perhaps following the rebellion of Ralph de Ga\u00ebl in 1075. In any case, his estates became part of the grants made by King William to Robert of Mortain. Brian may have lived the rest of his life as a semi-invalid in and near Brittany, staying with his wife.

His court was in Ioannina, and the territory he governed incorporated most of Epirus and the western parts of Thessaly and Greek Macedonia. Ali had three sons: Muhtar Pasha, who served in the 1809 war against the Russians, Veli Pasha, who became Pasha of the Morea Eyalet and Salih Pasha, governor of Vlore. Ali first appears in historical accounts as the leader of a band of brigands who became involved in many confrontations with Ottoman state officials in Albania and Epirus. He joined the administrative-military apparatus of the Ottoman Empire, holding various posts until 1788 when he was appointed pasha, ruler of the sanjak of Ioannina. His diplomatic and administrative skills, his interest in modernist ideas and concepts, his popular piety, his religious neutrality, his suppression of banditry, his vengefulness and harshness in imposing law and order, and his looting practices towards persons and communities in order to increase his proceeds caused both the admiration and the criticism of his contemporaries, as well as an ongoing controversy among historians regarding his personality. Finally falling afoul of the Ottoman central government, Ali Pasha was declared a rebel in 1820 and was killed in 1822 at the age of 81 or 82.

In the mid 1980s Ansara was involved in the Australian anti-nuclear movement and wanted to make a film about Australia's relationship with the US. She originally intended to make a documentary but then it evolved into a dramatic feature about a married relationship that acted as a paradigm for the US-Australia relationship. Ansara: It was a bit of a crude analysis, but it took so long to make (under the 10BA system) that by the time we finished the film - it was 1987 - for various reasons, the anti-nuclear movement was on the way out, so the film missed its time. And with films, timing is everything. If we had done it in a year, which we couldn't, it probably would have done very, very well. As it was, it did return 40 percent to the investors, but that was because it was very low-budget.

Blanca married Sancho III of Castile, regent of Castile (subject to his father Alfonso VII) on February 4, 1151 in Carri\u00f3n de los Condes, Palencia, after travelling from Calahorra, Logro\u00f1o, in January. The marriage was arranged to insure closer ties between Le\u00f3n-Castile and Navarre. As was traditional, Blanca confirmed documents with her husband, so her activity may be traced until 1155. On November 11, 1155 she gave birth to the future king Alfonso VIII. There appears to be no record of her activities after December 1155, and she died on August 12, 1156. The cause of her death seems to have been complications of a new pregnancy, a child named Garc\u00eda. In addition, she had other children buried in the church of San Pedro in Soria, although they are not identified. That her death was caused by a pregnancy is recorded in an epitaph engraved on her tomb, however, the engraving did not survive a sixteenth-century reconstruction of the royal tombs in N\u00e1jera. Her sarcophagus lid was preserved, and it represents the queen's deathbed with members of the court, including her husband, mourning her passing. Blanca was buried in the pantheon of the Navarrese kings in the monastery called Santa Mar\u00eda la Real of N\u00e1jera, to which Sancho made donations on her behalf.

A patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, the queen became involved in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her dower estates. In 1177 she entered the county of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses which had belonged to the crown there. After her husband died at Perpignan in 1196, Sancha was relegated to the background of political affairs by her son Peter II. She retired from court, withdrawing to the Hospitaller convent for noble ladies, the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena, at Sigena, which she had founded. There she assumed the cross of the Order of St John of Jerusalem which she wore until the end of her life.

In addition to being known for her film career, she received notoriety for being involved in several scandals throughout her career. Raised in Portland, Oregon, Carmen began acting in Hollywood at age 15, eventually performing with Keystone Studios. She first garnered public attention for her involvement in a statutory rape case involving herself and a 35-year-old automobile dealer in Los Angeles, but the charges against him were ultimately dropped as she could not concretely prove her age. Carmen resumed her career, appearing in several films throughout the 1910s, including a small role in D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), followed by leads in \"American Aristocracy\" (1916) opposite Douglas Fairbanks, and in Frank Lloyd's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1917). She also starred as Cosette in Lloyd's adaptation of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (also 1917). In 1918, she married film director Roland West. Carmen made her final film appearance in West's horror film \"The Bat\" (1926). In December 1935, Carmen garnered significant media coverage following the death of actress Thelma Todd, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the garage of Carmen and West's Pacific Palisades home. Carmen became embroiled in the investigation after she claimed to have seen Todd on Hollywood Boulevard hours after the time police determined Todd had died. A grand jury ultimately ruled Todd's death accidental, with the consensus that she had inadvertently caused her own death by running her car inside the garage to warm herself after West locked her out of the home; Todd and West had been engaged in a romantic affair at the time. Following Todd's death, Carmen and West divorced, and she lived the remainder of her life outside the public eye before dying in an El Cajon nursing home in 1984, aged 86.\nDocument[4](Title: Dorelia McNeill) Dorothy (Dorelia) McNeill (19 December 1881 \u2013 23 July 1969) was best known as a model for the Welsh artists Gwen John and Augustus John, was the common-law wife of the latter, and has been credited for inspiring \"his first unequivocally personal work\". In her time she was regarded by some as an exemplar of bohemian fashion. Dorothy McNeill was born in Camberwell, the daughter of a clerk and the fourth of seven children. While attending the Westminster School of Art in 1903 she met Gwen John, who in turn introduced her to her brother Augustus. That year Gwen and McNeill traveled together on foot through France, following the Garonne River. During a stay in Toulouse Gwen John painted several oils of McNeill, including \"Dorelia in a Black Dress\", before the two proceeded to Paris, where they briefly shared quarters in 1904. McNeill left for Bruges with a Belgian artist, and was pursued by Augustus, with whom she returned to England. She lived in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Augustus John and his wife Ida Nettleship, sometimes as part of a Gypsy caravan that would grow to include John's children by both women. The arrangement lasted until Nettleship's death in 1907, when McNeill became the principal female figure in the John household. Later she had an affair, at Augustus' encouragement, with the painter Henry Lamb. McNeill is often described as quiet and enigmatic. In Gwen John's work she appears detached and simply dressed; in Augustus John's art she at times served more exotic purposes, wearing scarves and long dresses, but was also the subject of domestic scenes, including those which show her with Augustus' first wife and their children. It is said that she \"made a significant contribution to the 'bohemian utopianism' of the artist's most intensely creative period, c. 1903-1914. \" Eventually she had two sons and two daughters with Augustus. She lived with him until his death in 1961.

Working exclusively in short films, he has produced almost forty works since 1937, nine of which have been grouped together as the\" Magick Lantern Cycle\". His films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing\" elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle\". Anger himself has been described as\" one of America's first openly gay filmmakers, and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised, self- implicating manner\", and his\" role in rendering gay culture visible within American cinema, commercial or otherwise, is impossible to overestimate\", with several being released prior to the legalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults in the United States. He has also focused upon occult themes in many of his films, being fascinated by the English gnostic mage and poet Aleister Crowley, and is an adherent of Thelema, the religion Crowley founded. Born to a middle- class family in Santa Monica, California, Anger would later claim to have been a child actor who appeared in the film\" A Midsummer Night's Dream\"( 1935); the accuracy of this claim has come under dispute. He began making short films when he was ten years old, although his first film to gain any recognition, the homoerotic\" Fireworks\"( 1947), would only be produced a decade later. The controversial nature of the work led to him being put on trial on obscenity charges, but he was acquitted. A friendship and working relationship began subsequently with pioneering sexologist Alfred Kinsey. Moving to Europe, Anger produced a number of other shorts inspired by the artistic avant- garde scene on the continent, such as\" Rabbit's Moon\"( released 1970) and\" Eaux d' Artifice\"( 1953). Returning to the United States in 1953, he set about working on several new projects, including the films\" Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\"( 1954),\" Scorpio Rising\"( 1964),\" Kustom Kar Kommandos\"( 1965), and the gossip book\" Hollywood Babylon\"( 1965). The latter would become infamous for its many dubious and sensationalist claims, many of which were later disproven, though some do remain as urban legends. Getting to know several notable countercultural figures of the time, including Tennessee Williams, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Marianne Faithfull and Anton LaVey, Anger involved them in his subsequent Thelemite- themed works,\" Invocation of My Demon Brother\"( 1969) and\" Lucifer Rising\"( 1972). Following his failure to produce a sequel to\" Lucifer Rising\", which he attempted through the mid-1980s, Anger retired from filmmaking, instead focusing on\" Hollywood Babylon II\"( 1984). At the dawn of the 21st century he once more returned to filmmaking, producing shorts for various film festivals and events. Anger has described filmmakers such as Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re, Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and Maya Deren as influences, and has been cited as an important influence on later film directors like Martin Scorsese, David Lynch and John Waters. He has also been described as having\" a profound impact on the work of many other filmmakers and artists, as well as on music video as an emergent art form using dream sequence, dance, fantasy, and narrative\".\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, Marie-Eug\u00e8ne De L'Enfant-J\u00e9sus or Kenneth Johnson (Filmmaker)?": [

In 1336, Diederik's uncle Louis IV, Count of Loon and Chiny, died without having had children, and a succession crises emerged. An agreement of 1190 stipulated that if the House of Loon were extinguished, the county would then be integrated with the Principality of Li\u00e8ge. The reaction of the Chapter of Saint- Lambert was immediate. The Prince- Bishop of Li\u00e8ge Adolph of La Marck moved to incorporate the County of Loon into the principality, while Diederik maneuvered to assume the title of count. However, since Diederik had married Adolph \u2019s sister and the bishop was fond of their son, family relations won out. Until his death in 1344, the prelate used all of his influence to ensure that the county remained in possession of his brother- in- law. But the death of the bishop did not terminate possession the Counties of Loon and Chiny by the Heinsbergs, because Adolph \u2019s nephew Engelbert III succeeded him as Prince- Bishop of Li\u00e8ge. Engelbert removed the threat of excommunication pronounced against Diederik and allowed him to remain at the head of the counties until his death. In 1336, Diederik married Kunigunde of the Mark,( d. 1343), daughter of Engelbert I, Count of the Mark, and Kunigonde of Blieskastel, sister of Adolph of the Marck and Eberhard II, Count of the Mark( also his uncle through marriage to Matilda \u2019s sister Marie). Diederik and Kunigunde had one son: Upon his death in 1361, Diederik \u2019s nephew and heir, Godfrey of Heinsberg, Lord of Daelenbroeck, claimed the counties of Loon and Chiny, while the Prince- Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge claimed it as fief of the church.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Lucy Beall Candler Owens Heinz Leide's father?": [

In all, Lombardo is credited on more than twenty-five feature films. Noted mainly for his work as a film and television editor, he also worked as a cameraman, director, and producer. In his obituary, Stephen Prince wrote, \"Lou Lombardo's seminal contribution to the history of editing is his work on \"The Wild Bunch\" (1969), directed by Sam Peckinpah. The complex montages of violence that Lombardo created for that film influenced generations of filmmakers and established the modern cinematic textbook for editing violent gun battles. \" Several critics have remarked on the \"strange, elastic quality\" of time in the film, and have discerned the film's influence in the work of directors John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow, and the Wachowskis, among others. While Lombardo's collaboration with Peckinpah lasted just a few years, his career was intertwined with that of director Robert Altman for more than thirty years. Lombardo edited Altman's 1971 film \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\" (1971), which had \"a radical approach to the use of dialogue and indeed other sound, both in and beyond the frame. \" Towards the end of his career Lombardo edited \"Moonstruck\" (1987) and two other films directed by Norman Jewison.

A Hakka, he has acted in many films directed by Lau Kar- leung, including\" Mad Monkey Kung Fu\" and Legendary Weapons of China. In 1985 he portrayed legendary kung fu warrior Fong Sai -Yuk in the Lau directed action- comedy,\" Disciples of the 36th Chamber\" and also took a lead role in Fake Ghost Catchers, directed by Lau Kar Wing. Fake Ghost Catchers is marketed by Celestial Pictures as being made two years before Ghostbusters( inferring that the idea for Ghostbusters may have come from the movie). Hou is also known for portraying the\" disfigured swordsman\" and doubling complicated action scenes in 1993's\" Iron Monkey\". He was also the action director for the movie Shaolin Avengers( 1994). In 1982 he was nominated for Best Action Choreography for the movie Legendary Weapons of China( for which he was action director) at the Hong Kong Film Awards alongside Lau Kar Leung and Ching Chu who also provided choreography for the film. Born Hao Yiu Chung, he was trained in Beijing opera by Fan Kuk- Fa as a child and acted in films. He moved to the United States in the 1960s with classmates where he learned acrobatics from different instructors under the watchful tutelage of Fan Kuk- Fa. He later returned to China, and at age 17 became a martial arts stunt performer, which led to his starring role in\" Mad Monkey Kung Fu\" in 1979. He then became a contracted actor with Shaw Brothers Studio and studied Hung Gar, a specialised Kung Fu under Lau Kar Leung. A very young man at the time, he was always cast by director Lau Kar Leung as the rebellious teen. In the cult classic My Young Auntie Hou played the energetic rebellious teenage son of Lau Kar Leung. In Disciples of the 36th Chamber he also played the rebellious son. Because of an ability to perform difficult stunts and acrobats with ease, Hsiao Hou was often cast in roles that required an expert stunt performer and martial artist. While his career did not reach the popularity of frequent co-stars Gordon Liu or Kara Hui, he is considered a Shaw Brothers legend by legions of fans and is highly regarded for martial arts, comedic talents, and acrobatic talent. Lau Kar Leung was once quoted as calling Hou the most\" talented action actor( or star)\" in his class. Hsiao Hou's last known interview was in 2004 taken by Video Asia. Though he was not featured on the cover in western versions of the popular Shaw Brother releases, Hsiao Hou took the starring roles in Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Legendary Weapons of China, Disciples of the 36th Chamber, Fake Ghost Catchers and My Young Auntie. He later acted in small supporting roles in films by Sammo Hung. He has also been a martial arts and action director/ choreographer.\n\nQuestion: Who is younger, Lo Hsiao-Ting or Basil Hoffman?": [

Filmed in 3- D and DeLuxe Color and presented in CinemaScope, it is notable as the only U.S. feature film made in 3- D between\" Revenge of the Creature\", which was released in the spring of 1955 and marked the end of the 1950s 3- D movie fad in the U.S., and\" The Bubble\", which premiered in late 1966 and introduced the economical\" over- and- under\" single- strip format used by most of the 3- D films of the 1970s and 1980s. Like the feature- length 3- D films of the 1950s when they were originally released, it was projected by the polarized light method and viewed through gray Polaroid filters in viewers which, according to the film's poster, were\" scientifically designed by master craftsmen!\" Most theaters, however, presented it\" flat\", in 2- D. Although it is widely believed to have been filmed in Stereovision, Bob Furmanek, who oversaw the 2016 restoration, says this is a myth. It was shot full- frame with the original NaturalVision cameras used on\" Bwana Devil\". The center of the image was then extracted to create a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, in the manner of the then- current Superscope process. Unfortunately, it was poorly done, resulting in a large number of badly- framed shots; for example, the scene with the Flamenco dancers has a huge amount of headroom while their feet are cut off. Both\" September Storm\" and 3- D in general were roundly dismissed by influential critic Bosley Crowther in his\" New York Times\" review.\nDocument[5](Title: The Storm Rider) The Storm Rider is a 1957 American Western film directed by Edward Bernds, written by Edward Bernds and Don Martin, and starring Scott Brady, Mala Powers, Bill Williams, John Goddard, William Fawcett and Roy Engel.

De los R\u00edos was born in Buenos Aires into a musical family; his father was a musician and his mother a well known folk singer; he studied composition and arranging at the National Conservatory of Music under Alberto Ginastera and Teodoro Fuchs. He was inspired by an eclectic range of music and formed a musical group called\" The Waldos\" which crossed folk music with electronic sounds. De los R\u00edos turned to work in cinema and film sound tracks where his compositions were heard in the 1967 film\" Savage Pampas\", for which he received a prestigious award from the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences. He relocated to the USA in 1958 and then to Spain in 1962. He is best remembered for his ability to transform European classical music into pop music. His 1971 arrangement of Mozart's\" Symphony No. 40\", recorded with the Manuel de Falla orchestra, reached the top spot in the Dutch charts and scored a top 10 hit in several other European countries. In 1970, prior to this success, Waldo de los R\u00edos had already climbed the charts around Europe and America with Ludwig van Beethoven's\" Ode To Joy\", which he arranged and conducted for Miguel R\u00edos. His record\" Mozart in the Seventies\" rearranged famous Mozart pieces in a contemporary style, with a large percussion section. Several tracks from it were used as theme tunes to BBC programmes of that era, including the theme to the BBC's coverage of the\" Horse of the Year Show\"( his reworking of Mozart's\" A Musical Joke\"). His re-working of\" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\", used for many years as the theme to the Radio 4 quiz show\" Brain of Britain\", was the subject of frequent complaints from classical music fans( with whom the show was popular) and presenter Robert Robinson described it on air as\" Mozart plus sacrilege\". He also issued an album\" Symphonies for the Seventies\" which included Mozart's Symphony no. 40 and other major composers including Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's\" New World\". He arranged and conducted the Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1971,\" En un mundo nuevo\" for Karina. The song landed a respectable second position and hit the charts in several European countries. He was married to actress turned journalist/ author Isabel Pisano( born in Montevideo, Uruguay, 1944).

Later, Fubini became Assistant Secretary of Defense (1963) and a major voice for the policy of technological supremacy during the Cold War. He also served as the chairman of the U.S. Communications Security board. Dr. Fubini was the son of Mathematician Guido Fubini. The Defense Science Board presents the Eugene G. Fubini Award on an annual basis for distinguished service. The award was established in 1996 by then Secretary of Defense, William Perry.

Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied differential geometry under Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. His 1900 doctoral thesis was about Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces. After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he moved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in Turin and then the University of Turin, where he would stay for a few decades. During this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical analysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex analysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the outbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical circuits and acoustics. In 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini's Fascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf Hitler's Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New York City four years later.

Unable to secure the returns of any of the series' initial cast members, plans were made by developers to reconsider\" Tokyo Drift\" and make it a distinct entry in the franchise, which was achieved by focusing on a car subgenre, incorporating a location outside the United States, and establishing new characters. Subsequently, the chronological timeline of the franchise shifted, with all future installments( until 2015's\" Furious 7\") being set between\" 2 Fast 2 Furious\"( 2003) and\" Tokyo Drift\". The film also marks the first to begin the franchise's longtime association with director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, with Lin going onto direct the following three sequels( and is attached to direct two additional future films), while Morgan wrote the next five installments.

Although it is difficult to distinguish the two artists' contributions, Giovanni is associated with the St Jerome( 1444), which carries the signature' Johannes'.

Based on the 2001 novel\" Death in Paradise\" by Robert B. Parker, the film is about a small town police chief and struggling alcoholic who investigates the murder of a teenage girl whose body is found floating in a lake. The case brings the former LAPD homicide detective into the affluent world of a bestselling writer who exploits troubled teens, and the violent world of a Boston mobster. Filmed on location in Nova Scotia, the story is set in the fictitious town of Paradise, Massachusetts. \" Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise\" is the third in a series of nine television films based on Parker's Jesse Stone novels.

He invented his own cinematic style, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism( the only sanctioned art style in the USSR). This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films. Although he started professional film- making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as\" garbage\". After directing\" Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\"( renamed\" Wild Horses of Fire\" for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local( in Kiev and Yerevan) and federal( Goskino), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of rape, homosexuality and bribery. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release( he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a\" persona non grata\" in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor Dodo Abashidze and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted.

He invented his own cinematic style, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism (the only sanctioned art style in the USSR). This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films. Although he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as \"garbage\". After directing \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" (renamed \"Wild Horses of Fire\" for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in Kiev and Yerevan) and federal (Goskino), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of rape, homosexuality and bribery. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a \"persona non grata\" in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing.

Lewis achieved national recognition when she won the third series of \"The X Factor\" in 2006, winning a \u00a31 million recording contract with Simon Cowell's record label, Syco Music. Her winner's single, a cover of Kelly Clarkson's \"A Moment Like This\", peaked at number one for four weeks on the UK Singles Chart and broke a world record for reaching 50,000 digital downloads within 30 minutes. In February 2007, Lewis signed a five-album contract in the United States with Clive Davis's record label, J Records. Lewis's success continued with the release of her debut album, \"Spirit\", in 2007; it was certified 10\u00d7 platinum in the United Kingdom and became the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s. It is one of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In the US, Lewis became the first UK solo artist to debut at number one with a debut album, with \"Spirit\". The lead single, \"Bleeding Love\", spent seven weeks at number one in the UK where it became the best-selling single of 2007. She achieved international recognition with the album in 2008 when it topped charts around the world. \" Spirit\" has sold more than eight million copies worldwide, and \"Bleeding Love\" peaked at number one in over 30 countries, including the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the best-selling single of 2008. As a result, she was proclaimed Top New Artist by \"Billboard\" in 2008. Under the guidance of Cowell and Davis, Lewis released her second UK number-one album \"Echo\" and recorded the theme song for the film \"Avatar\" in 2009. She embarked on her first UK arena tour, The Labyrinth, in 2010. In 2011, Lewis released the non-album single \"Collide\", a collaboration with Swedish DJ Avicii, and her first extended play, .

With this chart entry, Lewis became the first British female solo artist to reach the top five with eight singles, surpassing Olivia Newton-John's record of seven.

He has been described as \"rock & roll's first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century.\" A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music , Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis. \" Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"Great Balls of FireBreathless\" and \"High School Confidential\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old cousin. He had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\" is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the \"Billboard Country and Western Chart\". His No. 1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for YouThere Must Be More to Love Than ThisWould You Take Another Chance on Me\", and \"Me and Bobby McGee\". Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper's \"Chantilly Lace\" and Mack Vickery's \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album \"Last Man Standing\" is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by \"Mean Old Man\" in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career. Lewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie \"Great Balls of Fire\", starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" listed his box set  number 242 on their list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records' Million Dollar Quartet and the \"Class of '55\" album, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley. Music critic Robert Christgau has said of Lewis: \"His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Outta My Head (Leona Lewis Song)?": [

Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s. Redding was born in Dawson, Georgia, and at the age of 2, moved to Macon, Georgia. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first single, \"These Arms of Mine\", in 1962. Stax released Redding's debut album, \"Pain in My Heart\", two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South. He later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.

The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and R&B charts. The album \"The Dock of the Bay\" was the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the Atco division of Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog.

He studied medicine at the University of Halle under physiologist Johann Christian Reil( 1759 \u2013 1813). At Halle, Achim von Arnim( 1781\u20131831) and Friedrich von Raumer( 1781 \u20131873) were among his friends. Following graduation returned to Bielefeld as a general practitioner, later serving as director of a hospital for the poor. From 1819 until his death in 1851, he worked as a professor at the University of Bonn. Nasse was a member of the somatic school of psychiatry that was popular during the first half of the 19th century in Germany. He believed that diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders depended on investigation of the somatic activity of a patient, formulating his belief system on the basis that physical disease produced a disturbance in the relationship between the psyche and the soma. He was interested in the works of Johann Friedrich Herbart( 1776 \u2013 1841), and skeptical of natural philosophers. Nasse is credited for introducing the practical experience of\" bedside diagnosis\" into the university lecture hall. Nasse died on his birthday, aged 73 in Marburg.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: The General Died at Dawn) The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors. John Howard Reid called it one of the fifty finest films Hollywood ever made.\nDocument[2](Title: Light in the High Plains) Light in the High Plains  is a 1953 Venezuelan film directed by V\u00edctor Urruch\u00faa.

The film was the only film the company would produce, and was based on a short story,\" Whapi, the Walrus\" by James Oliver Curwood. Curwood's story was adapted to the screen by Nell herself. She changed the protagonist of the film from a great dane to the female lead, Dolores. Shipman also shaped her character into a heroine, who saves her husband.

After he accidentally kills a store clerk, the trio embarks on a journey full of sex, violence, and people from Amy's past. Billed as \"A Heterosexual Movie by Gregg ArakiThe Doom Generation\" is the second film in the director's trilogy known as the \"Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy\", the first being \"Totally Fucked Up\" (1993) and the last one \"Nowhere\" (1997). The characters of Amy Blue and Jordan White are based on the Mark Beyer comic strip \"Amy and Jordan\". \"The Doom Generation\" was Araki's major film debut. It was shot mostly at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of $800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of urban sprawl to give the film an apocalyptic feel. The reasonable budget allowed Araki to hire professional crew, making it the first of his films not shot by himself. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 1995, before appearing at various other film festivals. It received mixed reviews from critics. During the press screening, many of the critics walked out. However, at the San Francisco International Film Festival (SFIFF), the film received critical acclaim, most proclaiming it as Araki's breakthrough film. Distributed by Trimark Pictures, it was released in the United States on October 27, 1995.

The film's sets were designed by the art directors Fritz Maurischat and Karl Weber. It was produced by a subsidiary of Tobis Film. Location shooting took place around Potsdam, including at the Garrison Church. Interiors were shot at the Grunewald and Johannisthal Studios. It premiered at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo. Part of the tradition of Prussian films of the Weimar and Nazi eras, the film ostensibly deals with the intense conflict between Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I and his son and heir, Crown Prince Friedrich \u2013 the future King Friedrich II\" The Great\". This is a well- known incident of 18th century German history, which had drawn much public attention in the time itself, and been artistically treated before. However, in its specific presentation of this historical theme, the film was clearly seen to be a work of Nazi propaganda aimed at extolling the\" F\u00fchrerprinzip\", i.e. blind obedience to the Leader( the King in the film's plot, Hitler in the reality for which the film was a parable); complaints of\" encirclement\" and the need for\" Lebensraum\" also feature. For that reason, the film was banned by the Allied military government following the Nazi defeat in 1945. However, after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany the FSK(\" Voluntary Self Regulation of the Movie Industry\") subjected it to a test on 4 August 1958 and ruled that, unlike other films made under the Nazis, the propaganda element in it was not so blatant as to justify its inclusion in the list of\" Forbidden Films\".\nDocument[3](Title: The Doom Generation) The Doom Generation is a 1995 black comedy thriller film written and directed by Gregg Araki.

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini.

A second war started between the two emperors in 324; after Licinius' defeat, Constantia interceded with Constantine for her husband's life. Constantine spared Licinius' life, and obliged him to live in Thessalonica as a private citizen, but the following year (325), he ordered that Licinius be killed. A second blow for Constantia was the death, also by order of Constantine, of her son Valerius. In the following years, Constantia lived at her brother's court, receiving honors (her title was \"nobilissima femina\"). Constantia was her brother's favourite sister and proof of such favour is that he minted coins with her image and with the title \"Constantia Soror Constantini AVG,\" or, \"Constantia, Sister of Constantine AugustusAVG\" is an abbreviation of \"Augustus,\" the center consonant being a \"manuscript U,\" not a \"V\").

He has been described as \"rock & roll's first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century.\" A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music , Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis. \" Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"Great Balls of FireBreathless\" and \"High School Confidential\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old cousin. He had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\" is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the \"Billboard Country and Western Chart\". His No. 1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for YouThere Must Be More to Love Than ThisWould You Take Another Chance on Me\", and \"Me and Bobby McGee\". Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper's \"Chantilly Lace\" and Mack Vickery's \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album \"Last Man Standing\" is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by \"Mean Old Man\" in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career. Lewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie \"Great Balls of Fire\", starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" listed his box set  number 242 on their list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records' Million Dollar Quartet and the \"Class of '55\" album, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley. Music critic Robert Christgau has said of Lewis: \"His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.\"\nDocument[3](Title: The Musician Killer) The Musician Killer is a 1976 French drama film directed by Beno\u00eet Jacquot and starring Anna Karina.\nDocument[4](Title: Killer (Kiss song)) \"Killer\" is a song by the American hard rock band Kiss.

He was an early friend of Polish- French composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. In his youth Woyciechowski was a fellow student of Chopin at the Warsaw Lyceum, and boarded with the Chopin family. He went on to study law at Warsaw University. Chopin dedicated to him his Op. 2\" Variations on\" L\u00e0 ci darem la mano. In 1830 Chopin visited Woyciechowski at his estate in Poturzyn, which he had inherited from his mother. Woyciechowski acted as a confidant during Chopin's passion for the singer Konstancja G\u0142adkowska. Chopin's passionate correspondence with Tytus at this period has given rise to conjecture that their friendship may have been homoerotic, at least on the part of the composer. Woyciechowski accompanied Chopin in his 1830 journey to Austria but, on learning of the November 1830 Uprising, returned to Warsaw to take part in the fighting. He became a second lieutenant and was awarded the Gold Cross for Valour. Whilst the two never met thereafter, they continued to correspond. Woychiechowski married Copuntess Aloysia Poletylo by whom he had four children- their second son being named Fryderyk after Chopin. Woyciechowski dedicated himself to agriculture, pioneered the introduction of crop rotation in Poland, and in 1847 founded one of the first sugar factories in the country. In 1861- 62 he was an active member of the White Party, which took part in the failed January 1863 Uprising. The Woyciechowski collection of Chopin memorabilia was destroyed by fire in 1914, and the family manor house at Poturzyn was destroyed during the Second World War.

In 1919 he joined the Polish Army and served with distinction during the Polish-Bolshevist War. Following demobilisation he started studies at the Warsaw Conservatory. He studied piano under tutelage of Henryk Melcer-Szczawi\u0144ski and theory of music in the class of Piotr Rytel. In 1926 he also graduated from the law faculty of the University of Warsaw. In late 1920s Dani\u0142owski spent two years working for the Polish embassy in Paris, where he fell in love with jazz and tango, two styles of music gaining increasing popularity in Europe at that time. Upon his return to Poland he started composing for the \"Qui Pro Quo\" cabaret. Numerous songs written for the star of the cabaret, Hanka Ordon\u00f3wna, gained him much fame in Warsaw and then in the entire country. Also in 1928 he founded a \"Ch\u00f3r DanaDan's Choir\"), modelled after \"The Revelers\". In 1929 he also formed an \"Argentinian Choir V. Dana\" which helped popularise tango in Poland, to the extent that already by the start of the 1930s it started to be considered a part of Warsaw's folklore. His music gained him much fame in 1930s Poland and he became one of the most popular composers of the time. His songs were sung by many of the most notable vocalists of the epoch, including Adam Aston, Mieczys\u0142aw Fogg, Zofia Tern\u00e9 and Mira Zimi\u0144ska-Sygiety\u0144ska, to name but a few. In 1930 he also wrote the score for the first Polish sound film, the \"Moralno\u015b\u0107 Pani Dulskiej\".

Following the outbreak of World War II Dani\u0142owski moved to Italy and then in 1940 to the United States. There he re-activated his Dana Choir under a new name (\"Dana Ensemble\") and adopted a new pseudonym - Walter Dana. He worked as a speaker for numerous Polish-language radio stations and signed contracts with Harmonia and RCA Victor record companies. In the 1940s he also founded his own label, Dana Records. In hid capacity of record company executive, promoter, and publisher, he was largely responsible for the \"big-band\" sound of polka music that became pre-eminent in the America.

During an intensive casting process, Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors, and finally cast actor Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones. Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to Magnum, P.I.

One of CBS's concerns was that shooting for Magnum P.I. conflicted with shooting for Raiders, both of which were to begin about the same time.

He was born in Carona, Ticino, and apprenticed under his father Guiniforte Solari, himself an architect and sculptor. In 1476, he was hired to continue the construction of the Duomo di Milano. Later on, he was in charge of several construction projects in Milan. In 1484 he sculpted a tomb in the Cathedral of Alessandria. In 1487, he was invited to Russia by Ivan III to construct the walls and towers of the Moscow Kremlin. Within the next two years, Solari built most of the walls (excluding the western wall built by his successor Aleviz) and towers of the Kremlin, including the Borovitskaya, Konstantino-Eleninskaya, Spasskaya, Nikolskaya, and Corner Arsenalnaya towers. Engineering methods, technique and architectural forms, used by Solari, were reminiscent of the fortifications of Northern Italy. On top of the Spasskie Gates there was inscribed the following inscription: IOANNES VASILII DEI GRATIA MAGNUS DUX VOLODIMERIAE, MOSCOVIAE, NOVOGARDIAE, TFERIAE, PLESCOVIAE, VETICIAE, ONGARIAE, PERMIAE, BUOLGARIAE ET ALIAS TOTIUSQ(UE) RAXIE D(OMI)NUS, A(N)NO 30 IMPERII SUI HAS TURRES CO(N)DERE F(ECIT) ET STATUIT PETRUS ANTONIUS SOLARIUS MEDIOLANENSIS A(N)NO N(ATIVIT) A(TIS) D(OM)INI 1491 K(ALENDIS) M(ARTIIS) I(USSIT) P(ONERE). Together with Marco Ruffo, Solari also built the Palace of Facets in the Kremlin. He died in Moscow in May 1493.\nDocument[2](Title: Eudokia Palaiologina) Eudokia Palaiologina or  (c. 1265 \u2013 18 September 1302) was the third daughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and his wife, Theodora, a grandniece of Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea. In 1282 Eudokia married in Constantinople John II Megaskomnenos, Emperor of Trebizond with whom she had two sons, Alexios and Michael. In 1298, after her husband's death and the ascension of her son Alexios II, she returned to her brother's court at Constantinople taking her younger son Michael with her. Andronikos II Palaiologos received his sister, planning to use her to seal a diplomatic settlement with Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin, King of Serbia: the hand of Eudokia in return for a negotiated peace. King Stefan was agreeable to this proposal, for one of his three wives had recently died. \" But nothing that Andronikos could do would influence his sister to entertain the prospect of life with a lecherous barbarian in the wilds of Serbia,\" writes Donald M. Nicol. King Stefan was forced to settle for Andronikos' daughter Simonida by his second wife, Irene of Montferrat. Meanwhile, Alexios II decided for himself to marry Djiadjak Jaqeli, a Georgian princess. His uncle Andronikos II, who had been appointed his guardian by his father, wanted this marriage annulled; he had planned for Alexios to marry the daughter of the high court official Nikephoros Choumnos. Eudokia used the pretext of inducing her son to dissolve the marriage to obtain her brother's permission to return to Trebizond in 1301; upon arriving, she instead advised her son to keep his Georgian wife. Eudokia died in the following year, and William Miller speculates she was buried in the church of Saint Gregory of Nyssa. Anthony Bryer has proposed that a Eudokia, who became a nun by the monastic name Euphemia, mentioned in a painted inscription recorded by Fallmerayer from the Panagia Theoskepastos Monastery, may have been Eudokia Palaologina. This Eudokia has not been satisfactorily proven to be a member of the house of the Great Komnenoi, and Bryer offers a number of objections to any identification. He notes that there is \"a strong independent local nineteenth-century tradition\" that Eudokia founded the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa before her death. Lastly, Bryer notes that \"it would not be surprising if she would have wished to put not only distance but a nun's veil between herself and her brother's ruthless and alarming marital plans (which included Mongol and Turkish alliances for other female members of his family) before she died in 1302.\"\nDocument[3](Title: Thomas Palaiologos) Thomas Palaiologos or Palaeologus (1409 \u2013 12 May 1465) was Despot in Morea from 1428 until the Ottoman conquest in 1460, though he continued to claim the title until his death in 1465. Thomas was the younger brother of the final Byzantine emperors John VIII and Constantine XI and also laid claim to the position of emperor following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, during which Constantine died. From 1453 to 1460, Thomas warred against his brother Demetrios over control of the Morea and over who was the rightful holder of the imperial title. This dispute came to an end when the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, who had conquered Constantinople seven years prior, invaded the Morea. Thomas fled with his family to Italy and lived in exile in Rome from 1461. In Rome, Pope Pius II recognised him as the rightful \"Emperor of Constantinople\". Thomas died in 1465 and despite his attempts and hopes, he had failed to garner enough support to kick-start a crusade that could have helped him claim Constantinople and restore the Byzantine Empire. His claims to the position of emperor and Despot of the Morea were maintained after his death by his oldest son Andreas.\nDocument[4](Title: Sempronia (sister of the Gracchi)) Sempronia (170 BC \u2013 after 101 BC), was a Roman noblewoman living in the Middle and Late Roman Republic, who was most famous as the sister of the ill-fated Tiberius Gracchus (died 133 BC) and Gaius Gracchus (died 121 BC), and the wife of a Roman general Scipio Aemilianus.\nDocument[5](Title: Carlo Blasis) Carlo Blasis (4 November 1797 \u2013 15 January 1878) was an Italian dancer, choreographer and dance theoretician born in Naples. He is well known for his very rigorous dance classes, sometimes lasting four hours long. Blasis insisted that his students learn theories and definitions of dance steps. He trained all of Enrico Cecchetti's teachers and it is thought that Blasis's influence in his training is what led Cecchetti to create the Cecchetti method of ballet. He published an analysis of the ballet techniques in 1820, in a work named \"Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, th\u00e9orique, et pratique de l'art de la danseElementary, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Art of the Dance\"). He is most known for the pose \"Attitude\" derived from the famous statue Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. Enrico Cecchetti expanded his method of instruction and theories. Even during his own time, Blasis was not best known for his many choreographies (none of which survive today), but for his writings on dance theory. He pioneered the reconciliation of balletic notions like lightness and grace with the geometry and physics of the body in motion. In \"The Code of Terpsichore\", published in 1828, Blasis cataloged a clearly defined \u201calphabet\u201d of dance poses. This may be the first attempt at a comprehensive systemization of dance. Blasis radicalized dance theory by relying heavily upon mathematical geometry and physics. He introduced the idea of a \u201cmovement axis\u201d - a vertical line through the pose, perpendicular to the floor, that delineates the center of balance of the body. Blasis also contributed to dance pedagogy. He suggested that instructors first describe the bodily figures outlined in his index of poses, then have students memorize them before attempting to physically embody them. \u201cThe most diligent [student] might take copies of those figure on small slates, and carry them with them to study at home, in the same manner as a child, when he begins to spell, studies his horn-book.\" Through the poses codified in his alphabet, Blasis felt that dancers could achieve the qualities of movement so desired in ballet like ease of motion and elegance. In his \"Notes Upon Dancing, Historical and Practical\", Blasis praises certain ballets for their richness of emotion. When speaking of \u201cThe Neapolitan Tarantella,\u201d for example, he raves about how \u201clove and pleasure are conspicuous throughout every movement,\u201d and \u201cevery gesture and motion are full of seductive grace.\u201d Thus, Blasis ultimately wished for dancers to layer emotional expression on top of the codified, regimented poses demanded by the choreography and outlined in \"The Code of Terpsichore\". Through these practices, Blasis aimed to direct \u201cthe newborn Romantic ballet along classical lines. \" In this way, Blasis was ahead of his time. He took particular interest in some movements considered to be too aggressively virtuosic for the Romantic era of the early 1800s. For example, he initiated the codification of the pirouette, breaking it down into a preparation, turn, and finish. It wasn\u2019t until the era of Marius Petipa in the late 1800s, just following the age of romanticism, that physically intense steps like the pirouette became widespread in ballet choreography, yet Blasis was analyzing them decades before. From 1838 to 1853, Blasis and his wife, Annuniciata Ramaccini, were the Artistic Directors of what is now the La Scala Theatre Ballet School. Prima ballerinas Fanny Cerrito, Carolina Rosati, Sofia Fuoco, Amalia Ferraris and Carlotta Brianza were among their students. Blasis referred to seven of his dancers, who he was particularly proud of, as his \"Pleiades\": Marietta Baderna, Augusta Dominichettis, Amalia Ferraris, Sofia Fuoco, Flora Fabbri, Carolina Granzini and Pasquale Borri. Blasis died in Cernobbio.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Philippe Solari or Stephen Jurika?": [

The first is Viraj Anand, the son of a billionaire named Satyamurthy, who gives his money to creditors after his father's death. A creditor still owed money is Paida Sambasiva Rao (the second of the three), whose daughter Sameera falls in love with Anand. Sambasiva Rao informs Anand that he has to produce documentation of land sold by Satyamurthy to a landlord, Devaraj Naidu (the third of the three) to marry Sameera. The rest of the film focuses on the consequences faced by Anand and Sambasiva Rao's change in viewpoint toward Satyamurthy. In addition to directing the film, Srinivas wrote its screenplay. Initially planned as a multilingual film shot in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu, the producers filmed in Telugu and dubbed it into Malayalam with the same title. Devi Sri Prasad composed the score and Prasad Murella was its cinematographer. Production began on 10 April 2014 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 September 2014 in Hyderabad, lasting until mid-March 2015. Except for three songs filmed in Europe, the rest of the film was shot in and around Hyderabad.

She is a philosophy professor. The meeting between the two women was recounted in the book\" Tout compte fait\", which Beauvoir dedicated to her. Le Bon was one of a number of young women that de Beauvoir and Jean- Paul Sartre cared and provided for. The two met in 1960, when Le Bon was 17 and de Beauvoir was 57. The relationship between them was, in Le Bon's words,\" carnal but not sexual\". De Beauvoir legally adopted Le Bon in 1980, making her the sole executor of her will.

She was the sister of Charlemagne and Carloman. Early in life she was betrothed to Leo, the son of Byzantine Emperor Constantine V (the future Emperor Leo IV) but the contract was broken. There is also a brief mention of Gisela being betrothed to Adalgis, son of the Lombard king Desiderius in 770, but this also fell through, and it is likely that by this point she had been allowed to choose a life of religion for herself. The specific year of her death is unknown, but she died between 810-11 AD in Chelles, Seine-et-Marne, Ile-de-France, France, in the convent she had served for most of her life, aged between 53 and 54. Gisela is often said to be the only sister to Charlemagne and Carloman, but this was not the case. Pepin the Short in fact had seven legitimate children; Gisela had three older brothers, Rothaid III, born 740, Charlemagne, born 742, and Carloman, born 751. She had two older sisters, Adelheid, born 740, and Bertbelle, born 745. She also had a single younger brother, Charles, who was born 759. Most of her older siblings died before their father, although the years are unknown. Her little brother died in infancy, aged 2. She was one of three surviving children. Charlemagne's biographer Einhard states that Gisela had been dedicated to religion since her childhood. She became a nun at Chelles Abbey, where she was eventually made abbess.[1] As the abbess at Chelles Abbey, Gisela oversaw one of the most prolific nuns' scriptoria active in the 8th and 9th centuries.[2] While little is known about her education, there is suggestion she was well learned, for her correspondence with Alcuin was written and received in Latin. According to Einhard she had good relations with her brother Charlemagne, who \"treated her with the same respect which he showed his mother.\" Alcuin was a close friend. Where he wrote personal poem's for each of the king's [Charlemagne's] children, he also wrote one for Gisela, in which \"Alcuin hailed her as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love, assuring her of her prayers of the brethren at Tours.\" Other correspondence which hints at a friendly relationship is a letter written to Gisela between 793 and 796, where he thanked her warmly for the gift of a hat. In September 798, he writes to her from his monastery at St. Loup de Troyes, where he laments that an acute fever has stopped him from travelling to see her. In this same letter, he thanks her for the gift of a cross, apparently made at her monastery, and he bade her farewell as a most beloved sister. Along with this, he dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to her and her niece, Rotrudis. Considering the active scriptoria in Gisela's abbey, it can be argued that she held an involved role in the Carolingian renaissance. Other work she was involved in was the rebuilding of the church of St. Mary at Chelles, as well as building up the library, according to a letter from Alcuin. In it, he encourages her leadership in the project and states his intention to send a pupil and friend, Fredegisus, to assist her. Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard also named a daughter Gisela after the abbess. Gisela the Younger lived from about 781 to after at least 808, but little else is known of her life.\n\nQuestion: Who is Sobe (Sister Of Saint Anne)'s grandchild?": [

The song peaked at# 4 on the U.S.\" Billboard Hot 100\" and# 2 on the R&B chart. \" Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 82 song for 1972. The song laments the death of Fat Freddie, a character in the film who is run over by a car. Like most of the music from the\" Super Fly\" album,\" Freddie's Dead\" appears in the film only in an instrumental arrangement, without any lyrics. The song's music is featured prominently in the film's opening sequence and also recurs at several other points. Because of this usage the song was subtitled\" Theme from Superfly\" on its single release( but not on the album). It is not to be confused with\" Superfly\", a different song and the second single released from the\" Super Fly\" album. The arrangement is driven by a strong bass line, wah wah guitars, and a melancholy string orchestration. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Rhythm& Blues Song but lost to\" Papa Was a Rollin' StoneFreddie's Dead\" was ruled ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Song because its lyrics are not sung in the film\" Super Fly\".\n\nQuestion: Where did the composer of film Nighthawks (1981 Film) die?": [

(\u5927\u5b66\u306f\u51fa\u305f\u3051\u308c\u3069) is a 1929 Japanese silent film directed by Yasujir\u014d Ozu. The film is now lost, except for an excerpt of approximately 10 minutes. Ozu's friend and coworker Hiroshi Shimizu, who co-wrote the script, was originally slated to direct the film. Shimizu's wife Kinuyo Tanaka starred in the film. The plot involved a young man (Minoru Takada) who turns down a receptionist job after graduating college because he feels it isn't good enough for him, but needs to fool his mother (Utako Suzuki) and fiancee (Tanaka) into thinking he has a job. After he marries the fiancee he has to admit to her that he is unemployed so she takes a job in a bar. After an argument with her he apologizes for being irresponsible. He goes back to the company he turned down to accept the receptionist job, but they give him a salaried position instead. A poster from Harold Lloyd's silent comedy \"Speedy\" is used as a prop in the film. One visual gag in the film occurs when the man is apologizing to his wife and suddenly slaps her head, but it is then revealed that he was killing a mosquito. According to Donald Richie, Ozu's 1930 film \" I Flunked, But...\" was based in part on this film. To David Bordwell \"I Was Flunked, But...\" presents the opposite situation to this film, in that the protagonist does not graduate and so does not have to face unemployment. Both films reflect a theme that runs through several of Ozu's films of the period, that of youth unemployment in Japan at the time. Akira Iwasaki described Ozu's films in the period starting with this film and extending to \" I Was Born, But... \" as having \"more directly depicted the psychological depression of the 'dark period' than any other films. \" A \"Kinema Jumpo\" critic complained that the film's playfulness was \"jarring\" and that the happy ending detracted from the social message. Bordwell commented on the symmetry in the construction of the film, including how it begins and ends with scenes at the company office with opposite results, and how at first the man pretends to a job when he does not but later his fiancee pretends not to have one when she does.\nDocument[3](Title: College (1927 film)) College is a 1927 comedy- drama silent film directed by James W.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: \u00c6thelred of Mercia) \u00c6thelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, \u00c6thelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. \u00c6thelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; \u00c6thelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. \u00c6thelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 \u00c6thelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. \u00c6thelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was \u00c6thelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that \u00c6thelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.\nDocument[2](Title: \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians) \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians( or Ealdorman \u00c6thelred of Mercia; died 911) became ruler of English Mercia shortly after the death of its last king, Ceolwulf II in 879. His rule was confined to the western half, as eastern Mercia was then part of the Viking- ruled Danelaw. \u00c6thelred's ancestry is unknown. He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881, and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. The alliance was cemented by the marriage of \u00c6thelred to Alfred's daughter \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. In 886 Alfred took possession of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; as it had traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to \u00c6thelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year \u00c6thelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, \u00c6thelred's health may have declined, and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d may have become the effective ruler of Mercia. After \u00c6thelred's death, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918. The couple's only child, a daughter called \u00c6lfwynn, then ruled briefly until deposed by her uncle, King Edward.\nDocument[3](Title: \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d) \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, Lady of the Mercians (870 \u2013 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule \u2013 East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings \u2013 but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d to \u00c6thelred. \u00c6thelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. \u00c6thelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. \u00c6thelred died in 911 and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as \"one of the most unique events in early medieval history\". Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as \"her greatest triumph\". In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was succeeded by her daughter \u00c6lfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried \u00c6lfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d but they agree that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as \"a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul\". According to Pauline Stafford, \"like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages\". In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.\nDocument[4](Title: \u00c6thelswith) \u00c6thelswith (c. 838\u2013888) was the only known daughter of King \u00c6thelwulf of Wessex. She became Queen \u00c6thelswith when she married King Burgred of Mercia in 853. The couple had no issue. Her marriage probably signalled the subordination of Burgred to his father-in-law and the Saxon kingdom at a time when both Wessex and Mercia were suffering Danish (Viking) raids. Burgred also had ongoing problems with the Kingdom of Powys on his western border and in 853 \u00c6thelwulf subjugated the Welsh state on Burgred's behalf. Repeated Danish incursions over the years gradually weakened Mercia militarily and in 868 Burgred was forced to call upon \u00c6thelswith's brother King \u00c6thelred of Wessex to assist him in confronting an entrenched Danish army at Nottingham. This was the last time the Saxons came to the aid of the Mercians and is also notable as the occasion on which Alfred the Great, another brother of \u00c6thelswith's, married his Mercian wife Ealhswith. Burgred's reign lasted till 874 when the Vikings drove him from the kingdom and he fled to Rome with \u00c6thelswith. He died shortly after. \u00c6thelswith lived on in Italy, to be buried at Pavia in 888.\nDocument[5](Title: \u00c6lfwynn) \u00c6lfwynn was the ruler of Mercia for a few months in 918, following her mother's death on 12 June 918.

She was known for her lifelike ceramic pieces and sculptures which are included in the collections of museums worldwide. Her trademark pieces, which were fashioned from stoneware or porcelain, often used the artist technique of trompe -l'\u0153il( meaning\" deceive the eye\" or\" fooling the eye\" in French) to create the realism of art. Much of Hyman's work featured everyday objects, such as paper, books, or food, realistically crafted from ceramic. She was also the founder of the Tennessee Association of Craft Artists( TACA). Hyman was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1917. She received her bachelor's degree in art education in 1938 from the New York State Teachers College at Buffalo( now Buffalo State College). Hyman later obtained a master's degree in art education from Peabody College for Teachers, now known as Peabody College of Vanderbilt University, in 1963 in Nashville, Tennessee. Professionally, Hyman worked as a public school art teacher, as well as a faculty member of Peabody College. In 1957, after working as a public school teacher for approximately fifteen years, Hyman received some ceramic equipment, which launched her artistic career as a ceramist. Examples of her work are included in the collections of museums and art collections worldwide including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, the Saga Prefectural Museum in Saga, Japan, the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville, and the Renwick Gallery in Washington D.C.

The album was supported by a cross-Canada tour, and gave the band further radio airplay for the singles \"Shine On\" and \"Sex Gorilla\". (The latter title was a band in-joke. The song had actually been written as \"Sarsparilla\", but the fans kept misunderstanding the lyrics, so the band relented and retitled the song.) \"Sex Gorilla\" also led to a fan tradition of throwing bananas at the stage during their shows. The band subsequently left Capitol Records, and released their third and final album \"Wildseed\" in 1995 on the independent label Iron Music.

In 1370 he succeeded his (maternal) grandfather as the Duke or Prince of L\u00fcneburg. William II of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg named his grandson Albert as his heir in L\u00fcneburg because neither he or his brother had male heirs. In fact William II had previously asked Emperor Charles IV for the eventual enfeoffment of the state to his grandson, but backed away again in the years that followed, because he feared the influence of Albert's uncles, Wenceslas I and Rudolf II. A further reason may be found in the terms of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg investiture agreement of 1235 as well as the succession treaties agreed by William's father Otto the Strict with Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg's Wolfenb\u00fcttel line of the House of Welf, according to which the principality had to be passed to any male heir within the entire Welf house if there were one. After the death of William II and the succession of the Wolfenb\u00fcttel Magnus II, the L\u00fcneburg War of Succession broke out between Saxe-Wittenberg and Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Albert was backed by his uncle the Prince-Elector Wenceslas of Saxony (Saxe-Wittenberg). On 25 July 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle near Leveste on the Deister (part of modern-day Gehrden). After this an arrangement was agreed between Prince-Elector Wenceslas and Albert, on the one hand and the widow of Magnus II and her sons on the other. It was agreed that the land would belong, undivided, to the two Ascanians from Saxe-Wittenberg and, after their deaths, would be transferred to the sons of the fallen duke, Magnus II. And that it should continue to alternate after the deaths of the Welfs, i.e. the succession would pass to the Ascanians again. In order that this plan could also be reinforced by family ties, in 1374 Albert of Saxe-L\u00fcneburg married the widow of Magnus II, Catharina and chose Celle as his home, which he made a residence in 1378. The two still underage sons of Magnus also married into the House of Ascania in 1386.

She then began a full-time career in films and the 1998 action drama \"Ghulam\" was her first commercial success.

The differences in pronunciation are not simply regional, however, but serve more specifically to identify class differences. At the time, typical American pronunciations were considered less \"refined\" by the upper-class, and there was a specific emphasis on the \"broadera\" sound. This class distinction with respect to pronunciation has been retained in caricatures, especially in the theater, where the longer \"a\" pronunciation is most strongly associated with the word \"darling.\" The song was ranked No. 34 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs.\nDocument[2](Title: Let's Get Away from It All) \" Let's Get Away from It All\" is a popular song with music by Matt Dennis and lyrics by Tom Adair, published in 1941.

This program was codenamed,\" In Houston 2\"( which was thought to be a successor to\" Paris By Night 36: In Houston\", before the title was announced). Before the main subject title was announced, the program was then codenamed to\" In Houston 2: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 3\"( the third Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series). The\" three\" was scrapped off the title and the subject was simply,\" Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\". Vietnamese composer, Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, is one of the Vietnamese community's most famous composers today; composing famous songs before and even after the Vietnam War, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Since the early years of\" Paris By Night\", Th\u00fay Nga has been making single- composer videos dedicated to just a single composer. Starting in Paris By Night 64: \u00d0\u00eam V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Th\u00ednh Ph\u00f2ng however, Thuy Nga introduced the three- composer format.

However, composer Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is an exception. After being beloved by many, and his songs are in a timeless label, Th\u00fay Nga thought that he should deserve the entire program just dedicated to him and his songs, in a program that was meant for three composers. \" Paris By Night 88\" is Th\u00fay Nga's third live- performance show, after\" Paris By Night 86\" and\" Paris By Night 87\", which was the PBN Talent Show. This is a trend that Th\u00fay Nga may be beginning to adapt, after years of having singers lip- sync on stage, a practice that is common and accepted in the Vietnamese music community. \" Paris By Night 88\" used famous songs that was originally performed in\" Paris By Night 28\" and\" Paris By Night 22\", which were part of the Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series. This is also director Alan Carter's first direction of\" Paris By Night\", in place of its regular director, Michael Watt after many years.

Saint Joseph's Academy began life in 1860 as an extension of the work of the Brothers in Saint Joseph's College, Clapham. Bishop Grant asked them to start a new school in Saint George's parish, Kennington. The Brothers who taught in the Academy initially belonged to the Clapham Community and travelled each day to Kennington. ( The Bishop agreed to provide the money for their fares on the omnibus.) Then, in January 1865, they were set up as a separate Community under the leadership of Brother Acheul as the first Director. The Academy operated in Kennington for 56 years. In 1916 it moved to Camberwell for a few years and finally it moved to Lee Terrace in 1919 to become Saint Joseph's Academy, Blackheath. In 1977 Saint Joseph's Academy made the transition from grammar school to comprehensive school. Unfortunately, it was one of those schools that did not cope well with the change. There followed a period of gradual decline from the former glory days throughout the 1980s. Also during the 1980s, Saint Austin's Boys School, Charlton, merged with Saint Joseph's Academy and for some time the Saint Austin's site was used for the lower school. Eventually, the site in Charlton was repurposed as the site for Christ the King Sixth Form College before moving to its current site on Belmont Hill. Starting in the early 1990s, the school went through a particularly troubled period with a series of OFSTED inspections that placed it in a category of either \u2018 special measures \u2019 or \u2018 serious weaknesses \u2019 for eleven years. In 2002, at the initiative of the headteacher, Peter Stickings, and the chairman of governors, Brother Ben Foy, it was suggested that the only remedy for the terminal decline of St Joseph's would be for it to become part of the Academies programme, which was then being vigorously promoted by the government as a way of rescuing schools in serious difficulties, especially in London. The proposal involved the closure not only of Saint Joseph's Academy but also that of the neighbouring Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School and their joint re-emergence as a 3 -16 all- through co-educational Academy. High- level discussions on the feasibility of the proposal took place involving the De La Salle Trustees, the Diocese of Southwark, the DfES and Lewisham Authority. All parties agreed that it was an idea worth pursuing. The co-sponsors of the Academy would be the Diocese and the De La Salle Trustees, the latter providing most of the land for the site of the new Academy. This Academy emerged as St Matthew Academy as of September 2007.\n\nQuestion: Are Liverpool Boys High School and St Stephen'S School, Perth located in the same country?": [

Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the \"Koker\" trilogy (1987\u20131994), \"Close-Up\" (1990) , \"The Wind Will Carry Us\" (1999), and \"Taste of Cherry\" (1997), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works, \"Certified Copy\" (2010) and \"Like Someone in Love\" (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films \"Where Is the Friend\u2019s Home?Close-Up\", and \"The Wind Will Carry Us\" were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics' poll by BBC Culture. \"Close-Up\" was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial \"Sight & Sound\" poll conducted in 2012.

She is remembered as the benefactor of a foundation for worthy art students. Born in Budapest, Josephine was the younger sister of four brothers: Elemer, Feri, T\u00f3dor, and Miklos. She and her mother joined Theodore when he became director of the aerodynamics laboratory in Aachen, Germany. They lived in nearby Vaals, the Netherlands. Our home in Vaals was similar to my father\u2019s home in Buda. It had a huge high-ceilinged salon, a library, and numerous guest rooms. It was big, comfortable and altogether amiable. We eventually hired a Hungarian cook who became our most prized possession. My mother and my sister easily took over the organization of my social life, leaving me free for intellectual pursuits. \u2026 On weekends we threw open our home to students, assistants and visitors. My mother and my sister had made it a rule always to be prepared for unexpected guests, with coffee, cake, and slivovitz. In a short time, our home became a \"gem\u00fctlich\" meeting ground for a thousand ideas expressed, I must admit, at a high noise level in French, Italian, Hungarian, Dutch, English, and of course German. ... These sorties in internationalism were so successful that my sister suggested one day that we ought to do something to maintain regular contact with scientists in other countries ... because of the influence of our father who taught us to have a world view. With the help of Tullio Levi-Civita of the University of Rome they organized for 1922 the \"world\u2019s first international conference in mechanics\" in Innsbruck, Austria. Theodore recalled, \"My sister and I paid the secretarial expenses out of our own pockets.\" When Theodore was recruited to direct the aerodynamics laboratory at Caltech, the whole family moved:\nWhen Enrico Fermi was visiting Pasadena, he asked Theodore whether it would be possible to visit a movie studio. \" Since my friends and those of my sister included a number of Hollywood personalities, notably the Hungarian actors Paul Lukas and Bela Lugosi, I had no difficulty arranging a luncheon for Fermi at the studios.\" In 1951 Theodore and Pip\u00f6 travelled to the dedication of the Arnold Engineering Center at Tullahoma, Tennessee. After the dedication, on way to New York, she had a heart attack. She died in Pasadena on July 2, 1951. It was then that Theodore realized who he had lost: Theodore was a founding partner of Aerojet corporation which grew rapidly. Unable to fund the growing operations, the founders were pressured to sell their stock in the company:\n\nQuestion: Are both Alex Bregman and Francesca Sterlacci from the same country?": [

He was one of the founders of the musical genre later defined as Western swing. Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self- teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down,\" Blues in the Bottle\" was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old- time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album,\" Times Ai n\u2019t Like They Used to Be, Volume 1\" along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was\" Wake Up, Jacob\" which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith,\" Anthology of American Folk Music\", in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song,\" Oklahoma Rag\" was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled\" Memories of Prince Albert Hunt\" was released and was centered on the musician's life.\nDocument[3](Title: William Albert, 1st Prince of Montenuovo) William Albert, 1st Prince of Montenuovo (8 August 18197 April 1895) was an Italian prince and Field Marshal Lieutenant of the Austrian Empire.\nDocument[4](Title: Albert, Prince Consort) Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emmanuel; 26 August 1819 \u2013 14 December 1861) was the husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Born in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to a family connected to many of Europe's ruling monarchs, at the age of 20 Albert married his cousin, Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of prince consort, which did not afford him power or responsibilities. He gradually developed a reputation for supporting public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success. Victoria came to depend more and more on Albert's support and guidance. He aided the development of Britain's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliament\u2014although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston's tenure as Foreign Secretary. Albert died following a long illness at the relatively young age of 42. Victoria was so devastated at the loss of her husband that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. On her death in 1901, their eldest son succeeded as Edward VII, the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, named after the ducal house to which Albert belonged.\nDocument[5](Title: Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn) Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn( Arthur William Patrick Albert; 1 May 185016 January 1942), was the seventh child and third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

In 1910 he was appointed Grand Prior of the Order of St John and held this position until 1939. Arthur was educated by private tutors before entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich at the age of 16. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the British Army, where he served for some 40 years, seeing service in various parts of the British Empire. During this time he was also created a royal duke, becoming the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, as well as the Earl of Sussex. In 1911, he was appointed as Governor General of Canada, replacing the Earl Grey as viceroy. He occupied this post until he was succeeded by the Duke of Devonshire in 1916. He acted as the King's, and thus the Canadian Commander- in- Chief's, representative through the first years of the First World War. After the end of his viceregal tenure, Arthur returned to the United Kingdom and there, as well as in India, performed various royal duties, while also again taking up military duties. Though he retired from public life in 1928, he continued to make his presence known in the army well into the Second World War, before his death in 1942.

The son of a mid-level nobleman in Franconia, Count Henry of Speyer and Adelaide of Metz, he inherited the titles of count of Speyer and of Worms as an infant when his father died. Conrad extended his power beyond his inherited lands, receiving the favor of the princes of the Kingdom of Germany. When the Saxon-based Ottonian dynasty of emperors died off with the childless Emperor Henry II, Conrad was elected to succeed him as King in 1024 at the age of 34. Conrad continued the policies and achievements of the Ottonian Henry II regarding the Catholic Church and the affairs of Italy. Conrad continued to build the Church as a center for imperial power, preferring to appoint church bishops over secular lords to important posts across the Empire. Like Henry II before him, Conrad also continued a policy of benign neglect over Italy, especially for the city of Rome. His reign marked a high point of the medieval imperial rule and a relatively peaceful period for the Empire. Following the death of the childless King Rudolph III of Burgundy in 1032, Conrad claimed dominion over the Kingdom of Arles and conquered and incorporated it into the Empire.

Initially he was only the leader of those Normans in the service of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno, but after 1047 he was a territorial prince owing fealty directly to the Emperor. Drogo was born in Normandy, a son of Tancred of Hauteville and his first wife, Muriella. Around 1035, he arrived with his elder brother William in southern Italy. With his brother, he took part in the campaign of the Byzantine catepan George Maniaches in Sicily (1038) and then in the campaign of Guaimar IV against the Byzantines in Apulia (1041). In 1042, Drogo was one of the twelve Norman leaders who met at Melfi to elect his brother William their first count under Guaimar's suzerainty. In the ensuing twelve-part division of the conquered territory in northern Apulia, Drogo received Venosa. In 1044\u201345, Drogo fought on behalf of his brother in Apulia. In 1045, he seized Bovino from the Byzantines. After William's death in 1046, Drogo and Peter of Trani were vied to succeed him. Having the support of Guaimar, Drogo was elected by his fellow Normans. In 1047, Drogo married Altrude of Salerno, a Lombard princess. He reached an agreement with the Abbey of Montecassino, which intervened on his behalf to convince Guaimar to release the Norman count of Aversa, Rainulf II, whom he had imprisoned. On 3 February 1047, while the Emperor Henry III was visiting southern Italy, he received Drogo's homage and invested him with all the territory which he already controlled. After this Drogo began using the title \"Duke and Master of all Italy and Count of all the Normans of Apulia and Calabria\". Although legally, as a direct vassal of the emperor, he was on the same plane as Guaimar, according to the opinion of the historian Ferdinand Chalandon, he remained a feudal dependent of the prince of Salerno. When Drogo's younger half-brother, Robert Guiscard, arrived in Italy before 1050, he was ordered to leave the service of Guaimar's rival, Prince Pandulf IV of Capua, presumably on account of Drogo's obligations to the former. Other newly arrived Normans also gave him trouble: Richard Drengot attacked him and was captured. Only the intervention of Guaimar could secure Richard's release late in 1047 or early in 1048. In 1051, Drogo met with Pope Leo IX, when the latter visited southern Italy at the emperor's command to re-establish the \"freedom of the churchlibertas ecclesiae\"). Leo forced a promise from Drogo that he would stop the Normans from pillaging. In August, as he was returning from this meeting with the pope, Drogo was assassinated at Monteilaro, near Bovino, the victim of a Byzantine conspiracy organised by the Catepan Argyrus, who was planning the reconquest of Apulia. Drogo was buried in the church of the Santissima Trinit\u00e0 in Venosa. Drogo was succeeded by his younger brother Humphrey after a brief interregnum. A certain Richard, who joined the First Crusade, has been identified as Drogo's son.\nDocument[4](Title: Bolko II of Opole) Bolko II of Opole( before 1300 \u2013 21 June 1356), was a Duke of Opole from 1313( with his brother as co-ruler until 1323).
