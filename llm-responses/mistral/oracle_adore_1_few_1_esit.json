He is best known for films such as \"Eraserhead\" (1977), \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades, and for his successful 1990\u201391 television series \"Twin Peaks\", which led to him being labeled \"the first popular Surrealist\" by noted film critic Pauline Kael. A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won France's C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. He has been described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the most important director of this era\", while AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\". Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. He moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film \"Eraserhead\" (1977). After \"Eraserhead\" became a success on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic \"Dune\" (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir mystery film \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation. Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery entitled \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u20131991). He also created a cinematic prequel,  (1992), a road film \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) and a family film \"The Straight Story\" (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: \"Lost Highway\" (1997), \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), and \"Inland Empire\" (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated \"DumbLand\" (2002) and the surreal sitcom \"Rabbits\" (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited for a third season of \"Twin Peaks\", airing in on Showtime in 2017. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his role as Gordon Cole. Lynch's other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing three studio albums\u2014\"BlueBOB\" (2001), \"Crazy Clown Time\" (2011) and \"The Big Dream\" ( 2013)\u2014as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books\u2014\"Images\" (1994), \"Catching the Big Fish\" (2006), and \"Room to Dream\" (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the Dior promotional film \"Lady Blue Shanghai\" (2006). An avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM), Lynch founded the David Lynch Foundation in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees. In 2019, he received an Academy Honorary Award; his first Oscar win.\nDocument[3](Title: Ronnie Rocket) Ronnie Rocket is an unfinished film project written by David Lynch, who also intended to direct it.

He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95 BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half- brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts.

Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne.

She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Born a British princess, Victoria spent her early life in England and lived in Malta for three years, where her father was serving in the Royal Navy. In 1889 the family moved to Coburg, where Victoria's father became the reigning duke in 1893. In her teens Victoria fell in love with her maternal first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, but the disapprobation of marriage between first cousins of his faith, Orthodox Christianity, discouraged their romance. Bowing to family pressure, Victoria married her paternal first cousin, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1894, following the wishes of their grandmother, Queen Victoria. Their marriage was a failure. Victoria scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901. The couple's only child, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever in 1903. Victoria married Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1905. They wed without the formal approval of Britain's King Edward VII, required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, and in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honours, also initially banishing the couple from Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas recognized her as Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna. After the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917, they escaped to Finland (then part of the Russian Empire) where she gave birth to her only son. In exile they lived for some years among her relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac. In 1926, Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile and Victoria supported her husband's claims. Victoria died after suffering a stroke while visiting her daughter Maria in Amorbach.\nDocument[2](Title: Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia) Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia (2 February 1907 \u2013 25 October 1951) was the eldest daughter of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia and Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna. She was born in Coburg when her parents were in exile because their marriage had not been approved by Tsar Nicholas II. She was generally called \"Marie,\" the French version of her name, or by the Russian nickname \"Masha.\" The family returned to Russia prior to World War I, but was forced to flee following the Russian Revolution of 1917.\nDocument[3](Title: Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia) Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, (\"Kirill Vladimirovich Romanov\"; \u2013 12 October 1938) was a son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, a grandson of Emperor Alexander II and a first cousin of Nicholas II, Russia\u2019s last Tsar. Grand Duke Kirill followed a career in the Russian navy serving during twenty years in the Naval Guards. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War, barely surviving the sinking of the battleship at Port Arthur in April 1904. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They wed in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II prohibition. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honors, also initially banishing the couple from Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas II recognized their marriage. During World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards swearing allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government. During the rule of the provisional governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac. With the murder of his cousins Tsar Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today.

He was an educated man known for his lively wit and honesty, and he was an important figure in the poetry of the 1680s and 1690s. He was born in Oxfordshire, attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657. When all persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was \"not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability\" (Ellis 255). Instead, Sheppard became a courtier. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset). He would remain one of Dorset's closest friends throughout his life. While satirists and gossips (such as Anthony \u00e1 Wood) said that Sheppard spent his time as \"a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion,\" others suggested that he was a fundamentally honest man who was always interested in a good joke. He became one of Charles II's dining companions, and when Nell Gwynn gave birth to a male child, he was made the steward of Gwynn's household. This prompted a satirist to accuse him of being the best paid pimp in the land. There is little truth to this charge, however, as Sheppard was not paid by the crown for his services, except for two grants of \u00a3200. Dorset and Sheppard went to Paris together. Additionally, Dorset would travel out to meet Sheppard when the latter went out to the country. Whether he and Dorset got in trouble in Paris for some scandalous behaviour, as Wood suggests, or not, it is true that Sheppard lived a very active life. He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Fleetwood Sheppard or George William Whitaker?": [

Clouzot also directed documentary films, including\" The Mystery of Picasso\", which was declared a national treasure by the government of France. Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French- language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German- owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film\" Le Corbeau\" drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including\" Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\". After the release of his comedy film\" Miquette et sa m\u00e8re\", Clouzot married V\u00e9ra Gibson- Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for\" The Wages of Fear\" and\" Les Diaboliques\". Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of\" La V\u00e9rit\u00e9\", Clouzot's wife V\u00e9ra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave.

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\nDocument[2](Title: Jeanne de Salzmann) Jeanne de Salzmann born Jeanne- Marie Allemand often addressed as Madame de Salzmann( January 26, 1889, Reims \u2013 May 24, 1990, Paris) was the daughter of the famous Swiss architect Jules Louis Allemand and of Marie Louise Matignon. She was a French- Swiss dance teacher and a close pupil of the spiritual teacher G. I. Gurdjieff, recognized as his deputy by many of Gurdjieff's other pupils.

Madame de Salzmann began her career at the Conservatory of Geneva, studying piano. Later a student of \u00c9mile Jaques- Dalcroze in Germany from 1912, she taught dance and rhythmic movements. She met her husband Alexandre de Salzmann in Hellerau at Dalcroze's Institute. They married on September 6 in Geneva. With him she had a daughter, Nathalie de Salzmann( 1919- 2007). The First World War caused the closure of Dalcroze's Institute and Jeanne and her husband Alexandre moved to Tiflis, Georgia where she continued to teach. In 1919, Thomas de Hartmann introduced the de Salzmanns to George Gurdjieff, a relationship that would last until Gurdjieff's death in 1949. She worked with Gurdjieff for nearly 30 years. She led the Gurdjieff Institute of Paris and continued Gurdjieff's teachings, emphasizing work with the movements, until she died, 101 years old, in 1990. Jeanne de Salzmann played a major role in realizing the 1977 movie\" Meetings with Remarkable Men\" by Peter Brook. She was buried at Cimeti\u00e8re de Plainpalais in Geneva.

He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. He was assassinated in 1610 by Fran\u00e7ois Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII. The son of Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me and Jeanne d'Albret, the Queen of Navarre, Henry was baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother. He inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on his mother's death. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. He later led Protestant forces against the royal army. He and his predecessor Henry III of France were direct descendants of Saint-King Louis IX. Henry III belonged to the House of Valois, descended from Philip III of France, elder son of Saint Louis; Henry IV belonged to the House of Bourbon, descended from Robert, Count of Clermont, younger son of Saint Louis. As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was \"first prince of the blood\". Upon the death of his brother-in-law and distant cousin Henry III in 1589, Henry was called to the French succession by the Salic law. He initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which denied that he could wear France's crown as a Protestant. To obtain mastery over his kingdom, after four years of stalemate, he found it prudent to abjure the Calvinist faith. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a \"politique\"), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the era. Notably, he promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion. Considered a usurper by some Catholics and a traitor by some Protestants, Henry became target of at least 12 assassination attempts. An unpopular king among his contemporaries, Henry gained more status after his death. He was admired for his repeated victories over his enemies and his conversion to Catholicism. The \"Good King Henryle bon roi Henri\") was remembered for his geniality and his great concern about the welfare of his subjects. An active ruler, he worked to regularise state finance, promote agriculture, eliminate corruption and encourage education. During his reign, the French colonization of the Americas truly began with the foundation of the colony of Acadia and its capital Port-Royal. He was celebrated in the popular song \"Vive le roi Henri\" (which later became an anthem for the French monarchy during the reigns of his successors) and in Voltaire's \"Henriade\".\nDocument[2](Title: Gaston, Count of Eu) Prince Gaston of Orleans, Count of Eu (28 April 1842 \u2013 28 August 1922), the first son of Louis, Duke of Nemours, and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was a French prince and military commander who fought in the Spanish-Moroccan War and the Paraguayan War.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Alfred Hitchcock) Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock,( 13 August 1899 \u2013 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as\" the Master of Suspense\", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"( 1955 \u2013 1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film\" The Pleasure Garden\"( 1925). His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film,\" Blackmail\", was the first British. Two of his 1930s thrillers,\" The 39 Steps\"( 1935) and\" The Lady Vanishes\"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including\" Rebecca\"( 1940),\" Foreign Correspondent\"( 1940),\" Suspicion\"( 1941),\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943), and\" Notorious\"( 1946). \" Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for\" Lifeboat\"( 1944) and\" Spellbound\"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The\" Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film\" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\" After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with\" Strangers on a Train\"( 1951) and\" Dial M For Murder\"( 1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:\" Rear Window\"( 1954),\" Vertigo\"( 1958),\" North by Northwest\"( 1959), and\" Psycho\"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012,\" Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles's\" Citizen Kane\"( 1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite,\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.\nDocument[2](Title: Marius (1931 film)) Marius is a 1931 French drama film directed by Alexander Korda.

The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television, before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. Originally intended to be shown in dual- strip polarized 3- D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2- D due to the loss of interest in the 3- D process( the projection of which was difficult and error- prone) by the time of its release.

Born in Hungary, where he began his career, he worked briefly in the Austrian and German film industries during the era of silent films, before being based in Hollywood from 1926 to 1930 for the first of his two brief periods there( the other was during World War II). The change led to a divorce from his first wife, the Hungarian film actress Mar\u00eda Corda, who was unable to make the transition from silent films to\" talkies\" because of her strong Hungarian accent. From 1930, Korda was active in the British film industry, and soon became one of its leading figures. He was the founder of London Films and, post-war, the owner of British Lion Films, a film distribution company. Korda produced many outstanding classics of the British film industry, including\" The Private Life of Henry VIIIRembrandtThings To Come The Thief of Baghdad\" and\" The Third Man\".

Before his reign, Philip occupied an exalted place in the royal family of France as a grandson of King Louis XIV. His father, Louis, Grand Dauphin, had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain when it became vacant in 1700. However, since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip's older brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne, the Grand Dauphin's maternal uncle (Philip's granduncle) King Charles II of Spain named Philip as his heir in his will. It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe, such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it. Indeed, Philip's accession in Spain provoked the 13-year War of the Spanish Succession, which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns while confirming his accession to the throne of Spain. Philip was the first member of the French House of Bourbon to rule as King of Spain.

Formed in 1997, the group originally featured vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, lead guitarist Ben Weinman, rhythm guitarist Derek Brantley, bassist Adam Doll and drummer Chris Pennie, although Brantley left after only two shows. The remaining four members recorded the band's self-titled debut EP in 1997, before John Fulton replaced Brantley for the subsequent tour and 1998's \"Under the Running Board\". Shortly after the second EP's release, Fulton left the band due to \"creative differences\", and in early 1999 Doll was forced to cease involvement due to a spinal injury suffered in a road traffic accident. As a result, Weinman performed all guitars and bass on the band's full-length debut album \"Calculating Infinity\", released in 1999. Following the release of \"Calculating Infinity\", Brian Benoit replaced Fulton and Jeff Wood took Doll's place; Wood left the band in 2000 due to the ongoing effects of a gunshot wound to the head sustained in 1992, and was replaced by Liam Wilson. In April 2001, it was announced that Minakakis had decided to leave The Dillinger Escape Plan to pursue \"non-music related endeavors\", with the band briefly placed on hiatus. The vocalist was replaced later in the year by Greg Puciato, who was chosen from \"over one hundred\" singers who auditioned by submitting a recording of \"43% Burnt\" to the band.

In 2004, the band released its first album with Puciato on vocals, \"Miss Machine\". Later in the year, Benoit suffered nerve damage in his left hand which affected his ability to play guitar; after attempting to continue, he was forced to leave the band in April 2005 and was replaced by James Love. During a tour in 2006, tensions arose between Weinman and Pennie, with the guitarist briefly leaving the band citing \"undisclosed personal reasons\". Pennie eventually left the band in 2007 to join Coheed and Cambria, with Gil Sharone replacing him for the band's third album \"Ire Works\".

He was one of the first patroons, but the only one to become successful. He founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York's Capital District. His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s. Eventually, that came to an end during the Anti-Rent War. Van Rensselaer was the son of Hendrick Kiliaensz van Rensselaer, a soldier from Nijkerk in the \"States army of the duke of Upper Saxony\", and Maria Pafraet, descendant of a well-known printers' dynasty. To keep from risking his life in the army like his father, he apprenticed under his uncle, a successful Amsterdam jeweler. He too became a successful jeweler and was one of the first subscribers to the Dutch West India Company upon its conception. The concept of patroonships may have been Kiliaen van Rensselaer's; he\nwas likely the leading proponent of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions, the document that established the patroon system. His patroonship became the most successful to exist, making full use of his business tactics and advantages, such as his connection to the Director of New Netherland, his confidantes at the West India Company, and his extended family members who were eager to emigrate to a better place to farm. Van Rensselaer married twice and had at least eleven children. When he died sometime after 1642, two succeeded him as patroons of Rensselaerswyck. Van Rensselaer had a marked effect on the history of the United States. The American Van Rensselaers all descend from Kiliaen's son Jeremias and the subsequent Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States, producing multiple State Legislators, Congressmen, and two Lieutenant Governors in New York.\n\nQuestion: Which country Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father is from?": [

He was a son of the Frankish statesman Pepin of Herstal and Pepin's mistress, a noblewoman named Alpaida. Charles successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics. Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul. According to a near-contemporary source, the \"Liber Historiae Francorum\", Charles was \"a warrior who was uncommonly  effective in battle\". Much attention has been paid to his success in defeating an Arab invasion in Aquitaine at the Battle of Tours. Alongside his military endeavours, Charles has been traditionally credited with a seminal role in the development of the Frankish system of feudalism. At the end of his reign, Charles divided Francia between his sons, Carloman and Pepin. The latter became the first king of the Carolingian dynasty.

It is known for the Big Ben sequence near the end, inspired by the film\" My Learned Friend\"( 1943), starring Will Hay, although this is its most fundamental deviation from Buchan's original story, which reaches its culmination in a coastal location in Kent.

The lake covers a total of 199 acres( 80 hectare) and reaches a maximum depth of 15 feet( 4.6 m). The littoral zone is 129 acres( 52 hectare). Due to its shallow depth and subsequent abundant plant and algae growth, water clarity extends 6 feet( 1.8 m). The lake hosts small populations of northern pike and walleye and large communities of panfish. Access to Lake Windigo is by a short portage from Cass Lake on the north side of the island.

The village of Ozaawindib, Schoolcraft's guide to Lake Itasca, was located on the island. The Ojibwe people flourished in the area up until the arrival of American and European settlers. In the early 1900s, parts of the island were sold to private entities, while the majority of the island entered the protection of the federal government as a national forest. It remains this way to this day. The lake derives its name from the Wendigo or Windigo of Ojibwe mythology. A cryptoid was a malevolent, cannibalistic spirit that could possess people and inspire cannibalism, particularly during times of famine. Wendigo ceremonies were often performed during times of famine to remind the people to be wary of the Wendigo spirits.\nDocument[2](Title: Little Sachigo Lake) Little Sachigo Lake is a lake in Unorganized Kenora District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.

The heroes of the film are the shoemaker Maruf and the daughter of the Caliph, Esmag\u00fcl, who despite falling in love with a young man, nevertheless forces him to fight for his own happiness.\nDocument[2](Title: Takhir Sabirov) Takhir Sabirov( December 21, 1929 \u2013 May 30, 2002) is a Tajik film director, actor, screenwriter, art director, and one of the most notable figures of the Tajik cinema. He is known as the\" founding father\" of the\" One Thousand and One Nights\" dynasty of the film industry due to his creation of the' Scheherazade' trilogy. He is also known by his formal name Takhir Mukhtorovich Sabirov. His mother\" Mastona Sobir Zoda\" was the daughter of Duke\" Sobir- kaloni Tura-zoda\" of Samarkand( now part of the Samarqand Province, Uzbekistan), from the Duchy of Greater Khorasan, known as\" Tura- zoda\", who were eminent members of Central Asia's Aristocracy. Takhir was the youngest of five children. He was married twice and has two sons and three daughters. He completed the Performing Arts discipline at the Tashkent State Art Institute of Theatrical Arts in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In 1951, he then continued further by obtaining his Directorial discipline under faculty of Yuri Zavadsky at The Russian Academy of Theatre Arts( GITIS) in Moscow, Russia. His first film,\" Roh\"( 1955) ( Russian title:\" \u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\") produced by Mosfilm initiated him into the film industry, but the role of\" Yodgor\" in\" Dokhunda\"( 1956) sparked his career and was followed by several successful roles. His directorial debut was in\" Vaqti zangirii pisar rasid\"( Russian title:\" Sinu para jinitsa\", 1959), which was the first comedy musical motion picture in the Cinema of Tajikistan. With his films he introduced the Tajik film industry onto international scenebasis with his nomination in International film festivals. His film\" Margi Sudkhur\"( Russian title:\" Smert' Rostovshika\", 1966) was nominated at the International Film Festival of Asia and Africa in 1968. His trilogy of\" New Tales of ScheherazadeAnother Night of Scheherazade\" and\" The Last Night of Scheherazade\" that were based on the Arabic folktale\" One Thousand and One Nights\" had made a great impact in the Cinema of Tajikistan by opening it to European audiences and borders. The Scheherazade trilogies were among one of the first Tajik film productions that achieved distribution beyond Russian( former USSR) borders, placing Tajik film on the map of International Film Festivals. Not only has he directed and co-written the Scheherazade trilogies, but also starred as King Shahryar( Sultan); which coincidentally is more true to his own lineage of royalty. He became a cultural icon gaining more acknowledgement and respect. Regardless of the obstacles he had faced in his lifetime, he never stopped filming. He is known in the Tajik film industry as one of the major film directors of his time. He broadened his entertainment field as he established entrepreneurial joint venture\" Movarounnahr Joint Venture\" as an Art Director. Although he was involved in many fields of the film industry, he always had time to instruct and inspire students and apprentices. In 1999, he was part of the judging committee in the 21st( XXI) Moscow International Film Festival. He became the first Tajik film director to be honored with the position of a film judge. In 2002, he was an honorary guest at the 55th( LV) Cannes Film Festival. Even in his seventy years of age he was involved in film production.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Thietmar, Margrave of Meissen) Thietmar (II) (\u2013 3 August 979) was Margrave of Meissen from about 976 until his death.\nDocument[2](Title: Gero II, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark) Gero II (c. 975 \u2013 1 September 1015 at Krosno Odrza\u0144skie) was the eldest son of Thietmar, Margrave of Meissen, and Schwanehilde (Suanhild), daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony. He was therefore probably a grandson of Hidda and Christian of Thuringia and named for his great uncle Gero the Great. He succeeded his probable uncle, Hodo, as Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark including Mark Lausitz (Lusatia) in 993 upon the death of margrave of Lusatia Hodo or Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark. Gero was created Count of Hassegau in 992, just a year before becoming margrave. He died in his territory in battle with a Polish army of Boleslaw I in Gau Diadesi and was buried in his family's monastery of Nienburg. He was survived by his wife Adelaide (Athelheidhe) and one son, Thietmar, who succeeded him.\nDocument[3](Title: Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark) Odo( or Hodo) I( also\" Huodo\" or\" Huoto\")( c. 930 \u2013 13 March 993) was margrave in the Saxon Eastern March of the Holy Roman Empire from 965 until his death. Odo was, if the onomastics are correct, a son( or maybe a nephew) of Christian( d. 950), a Saxon count in the Nordth\u00fcringgau and Schwabengau of Eastphalia. Count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, had married Hidda( d. 970), a sister of Gero, margrave of the vast\" marca Geronis\" in the lands settled by Polabian Slavs. From 945 he also ruled over the adjacent gau of Serimunt beyond the Saale river. In 965, Margrave Gero died and his great\" marca Geronis\" was divided into five smaller marches. Count Thietmar, a known son of Hidda, and Odo inherited large parts of his march: Odo received the so- called\" marca Orientalis\" or Eastern March, stretching from the Gau Serimunt in the west up to the remotest outposts on the B\u00f3br river in the east, while Thietmar appeared as margrave of southern Meissen after 970. Both are buried at Nienburg Abbey, a foundation of Thietmar and his brother Archbishop Gero of Cologne, which too provides evidence of their probable relationship. As a young man, Margrave Odo had shared the tutorship of Otto's son( later Otto II) with the boy's step- uncle William, Archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop William taught literature and culture; Margrave Odo taught war and legal customs. Odo spent the first years of his rule subduing the Slavic tribes settling in the eastern parts of the Saxon Ostmark. He held comital rights in the gau of Nizizi, comprising the lands between the Mulde, Elbe and Black Elster rivers, and appeared with the title\" marchio\"( margrave) only in 974, though he had held further marcher territories( officially as a county) since 965. In that same year( 974), Odo was made Count in the Saxon Nordth\u00fcringgau, still rivalling with Margrave Thietmar. Odo is chiefly known for his quarrels with the Polish duke Mieszko I. The West Slavic Polans had established a state east of the Saxon marches and, aiming to advance into the Pomeranian lands north of the Warta river, had reached an agreement with late Margrave Gero and Emperor Otto I: Mieszko's ducal title was confirmed and the Polans paid a recurring tribute to the emperor, which was collected by Margrave Odo. The medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, apparently quite gladly, relates that Odo's reputation with Mieszko was such that the duke of Poland\" would not have dared while wearing his fur coat to enter a house where he knew the margrave to be, or to remain seated when the margrave stood up.\" When in 972 the Polans again marched for the Baltic trade centre of Wolin, they entered into open conflict with Odo. The margrave, intending to compel Mieszko to pay tribute for the Pomeranian territory between the Oder and Warta rivers, invaded that region. Aged Emperor Otto, engaged in the marriage of his son Otto II with Princess Theophanu at far- off Rome, ordered them to cease until he himself could arbitrate their dispute. However, Odo attacked Mieszko's forces and was defeated on 24 June at the Battle of Cedynia. The belligerents reconciled at the Imperial Diet in Quedlinburg one year later. In 983, Odo took part in the attempts to suppress the Great Slav Rising of the Polabian Lutici tribes, but was not able to prevent the loss of the Saxon Northern March. He also failed to succeed Thietmar in the Margraviate of Meissen in 979. Odo left a son, Siegfried( d. 1030), who became a monk at Nienburg, but left the monastery on his father's death to claim his inheritance. He did however not prevail against Thietmar's son Gero II, who became Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark in 993. Siegfried again appeared as a count from 1015, when he claimed the Saxon Ostmark from Gero's son Thietmar IV and allied with Duke Mieszko II of Poland in the German- Polish War. Thietmar IV prevailed with the support by Emperor Henry II, but lost the eastern parts of his march to Mieszko II in the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.\n\nQuestion: What is the date of death of Gero Ii, Margrave Of The Saxon Ostmark's father?": [

The film stars Dilip Kumar, Vyjayanthimala and Nasir Khan in the lead roles. Set in a rural part of the Awadh region of Northern India, the film tells the story of two impoverished brothers, Ganga and Jamna (Dilip Kumar and Nasir Khan), and their poignancy and sibling rivalry on opposing sides of the law, one a dacoit criminal and the other a police officer. The film was also notable for its Technicolor production, use of the Awadhi dialect, and its rustic setting, and it is a defining example of the dacoit film genre. After six months of delay, the film was finally released in January 1961. Upon release the film was well received by the critics and the audience. It was one of the biggest hits of the 1960s and one of the most successful Indian films in terms of box office collection, domestically in India and overseas in the Soviet Union. Its controversial theme also earned the film a cult status. The film received critical acclaim and was regarded as one of the best films of all time. Critics praised its story, screenplay, direction, cinematography and the music along with the performances of the lead actors Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanthimala. Upon release it was nominated in seven categories at the 9th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film and Best Director for Kumar and Bose, respectively, while winning three, Best Actress for Vyjayanthimala, Best Cinematography for V.

In addition, the film also won Certificate of Merit at the 9th National Film Awards. It also won prizes at international film festivals, including the Boston International Film Festival and the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The film was a trendsetter in Indian cinema. Dilip Kumar's performance as Ganga is considered one of the finest acting performances in the history of Indian cinema, and inspired future generations of Indian actors, most notably Amitabh Bachchan. The film's plot also inspired screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, who wrote scripts exploring similar themes in later Bachchan-starring hits such as \"Deewaar\" (1975), \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" (1977) and \"Trishul\" (1978). \" Ganga Jamna\" also had South Indian remakes, including the Tamil film \"Iru Thuruvam\" (1971) and the Malayalam film \"Lava\" (1980).\nDocument[3](Title: Ulti Ganga) Ulti Ganga is a Bollywood film.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: David Lloyd George) David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, (17 January 1863 \u2013 26 March 1945) was a British statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1916 and 1922. He was the final Liberal to hold the post. Lloyd George was born in Manchester to Welsh parents. His father\u2014a schoolmaster\u2014died in 1864 and he was raised in Wales by his mother and her shoemaker brother, whose Liberal politics and Baptist faith strongly influenced Lloyd George; the same uncle helped the boy embark on a career as a solicitor after leaving school. Lloyd George became active in local politics, gaining a reputation as an orator and a proponent of a Welsh blend of radical Liberalism which championed nonconformism and the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales, equality for labourers and tenant farmers, and reform of landownership. In 1890, he narrowly won a by-election to become the Member of Parliament for Caernarvon Boroughs, in which seat he remained for fifty-five years. Lloyd George served in Henry Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet from 1905. After H. H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908, Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer. To fund extensive welfare reforms, he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the \"People's Budget\" (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected. The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. His budget was then enacted alongside the National Insurance Act 1911 which helped to establish the modern welfare state. In 1913, he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal but he remained in office and struggled to impose Irish Home Rule until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation. As wartime Chancellor, Lloyd George strengthened the country's finances and forged agreements with trade unions to maintain production. In 1915, Asquith formed a Liberal-led wartime coalition with the Conservatives and Labour. Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and rapidly expanded production. In 1916, he was appointed Secretary of State for War but was frustrated by his limited power and clashes with the military establishment over strategy. Amid stalemate on the Western Front, confidence in Asquith's leadership waned. He was forced to resign in December 1916; Lloyd George succeeded him as Prime Minister, supported by the Conservatives and some Liberals. He centralised authority through a smaller war cabinet, a new Cabinet Office and his \"Garden Suburb\" of advisers. To combat food shortages he implemented the convoy system, established rationing, and stimulated farming. After supporting the disastrous French Nivelle Offensive in 1917, he had to reluctantly approve Field Marshal Haig's plans for the Battle of Passchendaele which resulted in huge casualities with little strategic benefit. Against the views of his commanders, he was finally able to see the Allies brought under one command in March 1918. The war effort turned to their favour that August and was won in November. In the aftermath, he and the Conservatives maintained their coalition with popular support following the December 1918 \"Coupon\" election. His government had extended the franchise to all men and some women earlier in the year. Lloyd George was a major player in Paris Peace Conference of 1919 but the situation in Ireland worsened that year, erupting into the Irish War of Independence which lasted until Lloyd George negotiated independence for the Irish Free State in 1921. At home he initiated reforms to education and housing but trade union militancy entered record levels, the economy became depressed in 1920 and unemployment rose; spending cuts followed (1921\u201322) and he was embroiled in a scandal over the sale of honours and the Chanak Crisis in 1922. Bonar Law won backbench support for the Conservatives to contend the next election alone. Lloyd George resigned; with his party split between his and Asquith's supporters, his faction won less than 60 seats in the 1922 election. The next year the pair reunited to oppose Stanley Baldwin's tariff proposal which he put to the country. The Liberals made gains in 1923 but remained third after the Conservatives and Labour, propping up a Labour minority government; they never regained their status as second party and, when the Labour government fell, went down to just over 40 seats in 1924 under Asquith. Lloyd George led the Liberals from 1926 to 1931, putting forward innovative proposals for public works; this failed to convert into seats in 1929 and from 1931 he was a marginalised and mistrusted figure heading a small rump of breakaway Liberals opposed to the National Government. He declined an offer to serve in Winston Churchill's War Cabinet in 1940 and was raised to the peerage in 1945, shortly before his death. Lloyd George has often been ranked highly among modern British prime ministers, but his legacy remains complicated and controversial. Scholars have praised his welfare reforms and his efforts to mobilise and lead Britain to victory during the First World War, but he has also been criticised for adopting a \"presidential\" style of leadership, for distrusting his own commanders during the war, and for his strategic failures and involvement in various scandals. His legacies over Ireland and the Treaty of Versailles are also controversial. In the post-war period, he arguably alienated many of the workers he had earlier championed, helping to swell Labour's popular support at the Liberals' expense (not helped by his conflicts with Asquithian Liberals after 1916).\nDocument[2](Title: Lloyd George Knew My Father) Lloyd George Knew My Father\"( or My Father Knew Lloyd George) may refer to:\nDocument[3](Title: Gwilym Lloyd George) Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby, (4 December 1894 \u2013 14 February 1967) was a British politician and cabinet minister.

He was the son of William Douglas, 2nd Earl of Angus and Margaret Hay of Yester. Angus succeeded at the age of eleven years and was soon involved in strife with his Black Douglas cousins. He was forfeited of his estates by James II in 1445, under the influence of his near cousin William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas. The Earl of Douglas was trying to consolidate the power which he had gained through the murder of his cousins at the \"Black Dinner\" at Edinburgh Castle, sanctioned by the king and his own father James the Gross, 7th Earl of Douglas. It has been suggested that the feud between the Black and Red Lines of the House of Douglas was encouraged by Bishop Kennedy of St. Andrews as a method of curtailing the power of unruly magnates, and ensuring continued Stewart reign. Kennedy was a first cousin through Angus' grandmother, Princess Mary of Scotland, a daughter of King Robert III. During his forfeiture, Angus was surprised at the reluctance of his tenantry to pay their Feus, he made a point of collecting them punctually in person. Angus died in 1446. He was betrothed briefly to Princess Joan, third daughter of King James I , she was twelve years old when he died and was with her sister the Dauphine of France. She later married James Douglas, 1st Earl of Morton, the head of the Douglases of Dalkeith.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Boris Nemtsov) Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov (9 October 195927 February 2015) was a Russian physicist and liberal politician. Nemtsov was one of the most important figures in the introduction of capitalism into the Russian post-Soviet economy. He had a successful political career in the 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin. From 2000 until his death, he was an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin. Nemtsov was assassinated on 27 February 2015, beside his Ukrainian partner Anna Duritskaya, on a bridge near the Kremlin in Moscow, with four shots fired from the back. In the weeks before his death, Nemtsov expressed fear that Putin would have him killed. In late June 2017, five Chechen men were found guilty by a jury in a Moscow court for agreeing to kill Nemtsov in exchange for 15 million rubles (US$253,000); neither the identity nor whereabouts of the person who hired them is known. Nemtsov criticized Putin's government as an increasingly authoritarian, undemocratic regime, highlighting widespread embezzlement and profiteering ahead of the Sochi Olympics, and Russian political interference and military involvement in Ukraine. After 2008, Nemtsov published in-depth reports detailing the corruption under Putin, which he connected directly with the President. As part of the same political struggle, Nemtsov was an active organizer of and participant in Dissenters' Marches, Strategy-31 civil actions and rallies \"For Fair Elections\". At the time of the assassination, Nemtsov was in Moscow helping to organize a rally against the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the Russian financial crisis. At the same time, Nemtsov was working on a report demonstrating that Russian troops were fighting alongside pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin had been denying, and was unpopular externally but also in Russia. Nemtsov was the first governor of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (1991\u201397). Later he worked in the government of Russia as Minister of Fuel and Energy (1997), Vice Premier of Russia and Security Council member from 1997 to 1998. In 1998, he founded the Young Russia movement. In 1998, he co-founded the coalition group Right Cause and in 1999, he co-formed Union of Right Forces, an electoral bloc and subsequently a political party. Nemtsov was also a member of the Congress of People's Deputies (1990), Federation Council (1993\u201397) and State Duma (1999\u20132003). He also served as Vice Speaker of the State Duma and the leader of parliamentary group Union of Right Forces. After a 2008 split in the Union of Right Forces, he co-founded Solidarnost. In 2010, he co-formed the coalition \"For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption\", which was refused registration as a party. Beginning in 2012, Nemtsov was co-chair of the Republican Party of Russia \u2013 People's Freedom Party (RPR-PARNAS), a registered political party. At the time of his death, Nemtsov was one of the leaders of the Solidarnost (\"Solidarity\") opposition movement, an elected member of the regional parliament of Yaroslavl Oblast, and co-chair of the RPR-PARNAS, which is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, a Pan-European political party. After Nemtsov's murder, Serge Schmemann of \"The New York Times\" paid tribute to him in an article headlined \"A Reformer Who Never Backed Down.\" Schmemann wrote: \"Tall, handsome, witty and irreverent, Mr. Nemtsov was one of the brilliant young men who burst onto the Russian stage at that exciting moment when Communist rule collapsed and a new era seemed imminent. \" Julia Ioffe of \"The New York Times\" described Nemtsov after his death as \"a powerful, vigorous critic of Vladimir Putin\", who was \"a deeply intelligent, witty, kind and ubiquitous man\" who \"seemed to genuinely be everyone's friend\".\nDocument[2](Title: Zhanna Nemtsova) Zhanna Borisovna Nemtsova( born 26 March 1984) is a Russian journalist and social activist.

He was one of the first patroons, but the only one to become successful. He founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York's Capital District. His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s. Eventually, that came to an end during the Anti-Rent War. Van Rensselaer was the son of Hendrick Kiliaensz van Rensselaer, a soldier from Nijkerk in the\" States army of the duke of Upper Saxony\", and Maria Pafraet, descendant of a well- known printers' dynasty. To keep from risking his life in the army like his father, he apprenticed under his uncle, a successful Amsterdam jeweler. He too became a successful jeweler and was one of the first subscribers to the Dutch West India Company upon its conception. The concept of patroonships may have been Kiliaen van Rensselaer's; he was likely the leading proponent of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions, the document that established the patroon system. His patroonship became the most successful to exist, making full use of his business tactics and advantages, such as his connection to the Director of New Netherland, his confidantes at the West India Company, and his extended family members who were eager to emigrate to a better place to farm. Van Rensselaer married twice and had at least eleven children. When he died sometime after 1642, two succeeded him as patroons of Rensselaerswyck. Van Rensselaer had a marked effect on the history of the United States. The American Van Rensselaers all descend from Kiliaen's son Jeremias and the subsequent Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States, producing multiple State Legislators, Congressmen, and two Lieutenant Governors in New York.\nDocument[3](Title: Noerr) Noerr( named\" N\u00f6rr Stiefenhofer Lutz\" before 2010) is a pan- European full- service law firm headquartered in Munich, Germany.

Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common.

Hazmi and a longtime friend, Khalid al- Mihdhar, left their homes in Saudi Arabia in 1995 to fight for Muslims in the Bosnian War. Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999. Already long time affiliates of al- Qaeda with extensive fighting experience, Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States. Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999. Hazmi trained in an al- Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999. He traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al- Qaeda Summit. Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles, California, from Bangkok, Thailand, on January 15, 2000, with Khalid al- Mihdhar. The two settled in San Diego, staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000. While in San Diego, they attended its mosque, led by Anwar al- Awlaki. The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego. Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar's poor English skills, they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious. Mihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000, and they both traveled to Phoenix, Arizona. They later moved to Falls Church, Virginia, in April 2001, where the rest of the hijackers began to join them. Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001. The CIA reportedly received Hazmi's name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future. Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain. A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but they were not located until after the attacks. On September 10, 2001, Hazmi, along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. The next morning, Hazmi and four other terrorists, boarded American Airlines Flight 77 at Dulles Airport and hijacked the plane so that Hani Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Hazmi was initially dismissed as a\" muscle hijacker\" following the attacks, but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed. His younger brother, Salem al- Hazmi, was another of the hijackers aboard the same flight.\nDocument[2](Title: Zhu Chen) Zhu Chen (born March 16, 1976) is a Qatari chess Grandmaster.

He was also Duke of Milan, and from 1555, lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. The son of Holy Roman Emperor and King of the Spanish kingdoms Charles V and Isabella of Portugal, Philip was called \"Felipe el PrudentePhilip the Prudent\") in the Spanish kingdoms; his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake the Philippines. During his reign, the Spanish kingdoms reached the height of its influence and power. This is sometimes called the \"Spanish Golden Age\". Philip led a highly debt-leveraged regime, seeing state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596. This policy was partly the cause of the declaration of independence that created the Dutch Republic in 1581. On 31 December 1584 Philip signed the Treaty of Joinville, with Henry I, Duke of Guise signing on behalf of the Catholic League; consequently Philip supplied a considerable annual grant to the League over the following decade to maintain the civil war in France, with the hope of destroying the French Calvinists. A devout Catholic, Philip saw himself as the defender of Catholic Europe against the Ottoman Empire and the Protestant Reformation. He sent a large armada to invade Protestant England in 1588, with the strategic aim of overthrowing Elizabeth I of England and re-establishing Catholicism there. He hoped to stop both English interference in the Spanish Netherlands and the harm caused to Spanish interests by English and Dutch privateering. Philip was described by the Venetian ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as \"slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, somewhat prominent lip, and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive\". The Ambassador went on to say \"He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious.\" Besides Mary I, Philip was married three other times and widowed four times.\nDocument[3](Title: Philip of Sicily) Philip (born 1255/56, died 1277), of the Capetian House of Anjou, was the second son of King Charles I of Sicily and Countess Beatrice of Provence.

Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\nDocument[2](Title: Holm J\u00f8lsen) Holm Pedersen J\u00f8lsen (6 December 1833 \u2013 1 August 1906) was a Norwegian industrial pioneer and plant owner.

The film dramatizes the creation of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima. The film originated in October 1945 as a project of actress Donna Reed and her high school science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, who was a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Bob Considine wrote the treatment, which was sent to MGM script writers. The title was supplied by President Harry S. Truman. At the time there was a legal requirement that permission be obtained to depict living well- known public figures. Many refused, but others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer, co-operated. Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, was hired as a consultant for$ 10,000. Although the filmmakers put considerable effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, the film is known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the\" Enola Gay\" on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and it is said that leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid.

Originally a Danish prince, he was born in Copenhagen, and seemed destined for a career in the Royal Danish Navy. He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. His nomination was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1867, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law, and King George V, Tsar Nicholas II, King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway were his nephews. George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully in 1864, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897).

He was the son of Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, and his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton, and the brother of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond and 4th Duke of Lennox, and of the Royalist commander Lord Bernard Stewart. Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated \"Love is stronger than I am\" which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War.\nGeorge Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montju\u00efc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650.\nDocument[2](Title: Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond) Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox KG( 7 March 1639 December 1672) was the only son of George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny and Katherine Howard, daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk.

By inheritance he was Lord Great Chamberlain of England, and in June 1520, at the age of twenty, he attended King Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.

He died at the age of twenty- six.\nDocument[2](Title: Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford) Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (12 April 155024 June 1604) was an English peer and courtier of the Elizabethan era. Oxford was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom, a court favourite for a time, a sought-after patron of the arts, and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and court playwright, but his volatile temperament precluded him from attaining any courtly or governmental responsibility and contributed to the dissipation of his estate. Since the 1920s he has been among the most popular alternative candidates proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare's works. De Vere was the only son of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and Margery Golding. After the death of his father in 1562, he became a ward of Queen Elizabeth and was sent to live in the household of her principal advisor, Sir William Cecil. He married Cecil's daughter, Anne, with whom he had five children. De Vere was estranged from her for five years after he refused to acknowledge her first child as his. De Vere was a champion jouster and travelled widely throughout Italy and France. He was among the first to compose love poetry at the Elizabethan court, and he was praised as a playwright, though none of the plays known as his survive. A stream of dedications praised de Vere for his generous patronage of literary, religious, musical, and medical works, and he patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as musicians, tumblers, acrobats and performing animals. He fell out of favour with the Queen in the early 1580s and was exiled from court after impregnating one of her maids of honour, Anne Vavasour, which instigated violent street brawls between de Vere's retainers and her uncles. De Vere was reconciled to the Queen in 1583, but all opportunities for advancement had been lost. In 1586, the Queen granted de Vere a \u00a31,000 annuity to relieve his financial distress caused by his extravagance and selling off his income-producing lands for ready money. After his wife's death, he married Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen's maids of honour, with whom he had an heir, Henry de Vere.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Francis II of France) Francis II (19 January 1544 \u2013 5 December 1560) was King of France from 1559 to 1560. He was also King consort of Scotland as a result of his marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots, from 1558 until his death in 1560. He ascended the throne of France at the age of fifteen after the accidental death of his father, Henry II, in 1559. His short reign was dominated by the first stirrings of the French Wars of Religion. Although the royal age of majority had been set at fourteen, his mother, Catherine de' Medici, entrusted the reins of government to his wife's uncles from the House of Guise, staunch supporters of the Catholic cause. They were unable to help Catholics in Scotland against the progressing Scottish Reformation, however, and the Auld Alliance was dissolved. Francis was succeeded by two of his brothers in turn, both of whom were also unable to reduce tensions between Protestants and Catholics.\nDocument[2](Title: Charlotte of France) Charlotte of France (23 October 1516 \u2013 18 September 1524) was the second child and second daughter of King Francis I and his wife Claude.\nDocument[3](Title: Catherine de' Medici) Catherine de' Medici (13 April 1519 \u2013 5 January 1589), was an Italian noblewoman who was queen consort of France from 1547 until 1559, by marriage to King Henry II, and Queen mother of kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III from 1559 to 1589. The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France. She was born in Florence to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle Pope Clement VII. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as regent for her son Charles IX, King of France. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months). Catherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France. Some historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters. In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the Valois monarchy on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power. According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe.\n\nQuestion: Where was the mother of Francis Ii Of France born?": [

Widely considered as one of the most influential directors of all time, Lean was mostly famous for his large-scale epics such as \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965) and \"A Passage to India\" (1984). He also directed adaptations of Charles Dickens novels \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), and the romantic drama \"Brief Encounter\" (1945). Originally a film editor in the early 1930s, Lean made his directorial debut with 1942's \"In Which We Serve\", which was the first of four collaborations with No\u00ebl Coward. Beginning with \"Summertime\" in 1955, Lean began to make internationally co-produced films financed by the big Hollywood studios; in 1970, however, the critical failure of his film \"Ryan's Daughter\" led him to take a fourteen-year break from filmmaking, during which he planned a number of film projects which never came to fruition. In 1984 he had a career revival with \"A Passage to India\", adapted from E. M. Forster's novel; it was an instant hit with critics but proved to be the last film Lean would direct. Lean's affinity for pictorialism and inventive editing techniques has led him to be lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott. Lean was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute \"Sight & SoundDirectors' Top Directors\" poll in 2002. Nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director, which he won twice for \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\", he has seven films in the British Film Institute's Top 100 British Films (with three of them being in the top five) and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990.\nDocument[3](Title: Madeleine (1950 film)) Madeleine is a 1950 film directed by David Lean, based on a true story about Madeleine Smith, a young Glasgow woman from a wealthy family who was tried in 1857 for the murder of her lover, Emile L'Angelier. The trial was much publicised in the newspapers of the day and labelled \"the trial of the century\". Lean's adaptation of the story starred his wife, Ann Todd, with Ivan Desny as her French lover. Norman Wooland played the respectable suitor and Leslie Banks the authoritarian father, both of whom are unaware of Madeleine's secret life. Lean made the film primarily as a \"wedding present\" to Todd, who had previously played the role onstage.

Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.\nDocument[2](Title: Eiludd Powys) Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.\nDocument[3](Title: Cynan Garwyn) Cynan Garwyn was king of Powys in the north-east and east of Wales, who flourished in the second half of the 6th century.

Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming dynasty. He was originally enfeoffed as the Prince of Yan  in May 1370, with the capital of his princedom at Beiping (modern Beijing). Amid the continuing struggle against the Mongols of the Northern Yuan dynasty, Zhu Di consolidated his own power and eliminated rivals such as the general Lan Yu. He initially accepted his father's appointment of his eldest brother Zhu Biao and then his nephew Zhu Yunwen as crown prince, but when Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne as the Jianwen Emperor and began executing and demoting his powerful uncles, Zhu Di found pretext for rising in rebellion against his nephew. Assisted in large part by eunuchs mistreated by the Hongwu and Jianwen Emperors, who both favored the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, Zhu Di survived the initial attacks on his princedom and drove south to launch the Jingnan Campaign against the Jianwen Emperor in Nanjing. In 1402, he successfully overthrew his nephew and occupied the imperial capital, Nanjing, after which he was proclaimed Emperor and adopted the era name Yongle, which means \"perpetual happiness\". Eager to establish his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion. This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police. One favorite was Zheng He, who employed his authority to launch major voyages of exploration into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day Beijing) as the new imperial capital. He repaired and reopened the Grand Canal and, between 1406 and 1420, directed the construction of the Forbidden City. He was also responsible for the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the Taiping rebels in 1856. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the imperial examination system in place of his father's use of personal recommendation and appointment.

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain. Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which he conquered in about 260 BCE. In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations. He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha. Beyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE \"Ashokavadana\"Narrative of Ashoka, a part of the \"Divyavadana\"), and in the Sri Lankan text \"Mahavamsa\"Great Chronicle). The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. His Sanskrit name  means \"painless, without sorrow\" (the \"a\" privativum and \"\u015bokapain, distress\"). In his edicts, he is referred to as ' (Pali ' or \"the Beloved of the Gods\"), and ' (Pali ' or \"He who regards everyone with affection\"). His fondness for his name's connection to the \"Saraca asoca\" tree, or \"Ashoka tree\", is also referenced in the \"Ashokavadana\". In \"The Outline of History\" (1920), H.G. Wells wrote, \"Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.\"\nDocument[2](Title: Tivala) Tivala (born 3rd-century BC), also referred to as Tivara, was a son of Maurya Emperor Ashoka from his second queen, Karuvaki.

He was the favourite child of his father and probably the crown prince , being his mother the only wife of Ashoka living in the palace advising him on his matters. Tivala is the only son of Ashoka whose existence is attested by historical evidence and who was a possible successor to his father. However, it seems that Tivala may have predeceased Ashoka and thus could not succeed him as Emperor.

It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his \"alter ego\", Andrzej Leszczyc. At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by studio. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schloendorff's German film \"Die F\u00e4lschung (Circle of Deceit)\", and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of \"Solidarnosc\", Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work \"Kosmogonia\" by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps.

She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of \"Tovarich\" (1963). After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in \"Fire Over England\" (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of No\u00ebl Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films. At the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband, Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life, she suffered from bipolar disorder, as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Suzanne Farrington's mother?": [

He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films( YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as\" Veer- Zaara\"( 2004),\" Fanaa\"( 2006),\" Band Baaja Baaraat\"( 2010),\" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\"( 2012), the\" Dhoom series\"( 2004, 2006& 2013),\" Sultan\"( 2016), the\" Tiger series\"( 2012& 2017) and\" War\"( 2019).

Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios( co- founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore( FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like\" Daawat- e- Ishq\"( 2014),\" Meri Pyaari Bindu\"( 2016),\" Sui- Dhaaga\"( 2018) and\" Jayeshbhai Jordaar\"( 2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films. He has remained extremely media -shy and a passive individual, battling constant reports of an alleged dysthymic disorder throughout his three- decade career, resulting in very few public photos of him being in existence.\nDocument[4](Title: American Sniper) American Sniper is a 2014 American biographical war drama film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Jason Hall.

He wrote three novels, two of which were published as \"Speed\" (1970) and \"Kentucky Ham\" (1973). His third novel, \"Prakriti Junction,\" begun in 1977, was never completed, although extracts from it were included in his third and final published work \"Cursed From Birth\". Burroughs Jr. underwent a liver transplant in 1976 after developing cirrhosis. He died in 1981, at the age of 33, from alcoholism and liver failure.

Burroughs) William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914 \u2013 August 2, 1997) was an American writer and visual artist. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'. He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture. Much of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict, as he lived throughout Mexico City, London, Paris and the Tangier International Zone near Morocco, as well as from his travels in the South American Amazon. His work also features frequent mystical, occult or otherwise magical themes \u2013 a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life. Burroughs killed his second wife, Joan Vollmer, in 1951 in Mexico City. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a \"William Tell\" stunt. He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer. After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter \"in absentia\", and received a two-year suspended sentence. Burroughs found success with his confessional first novel, \"Junkie\" (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel \"Naked Lunch\" (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. sodomy laws. With Brion Gysin, he also popularized the literary cut-up technique in works such as The Nova Trilogy (1961\u20131964). In 1983, Burroughs was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1984 he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the \"greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift\", a reputation he owes to his \"lifelong subversion\" of the moral, political, and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous sardonicism. J. G. Ballard considered Burroughs to be \"the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War\", while Norman Mailer declared him \"the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius\". Burroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator Brion Gysin. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide. Burroughs had one child, William S. Burroughs Jr. (1947\u20131981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer. William Burroughs died at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, after suffering a heart attack in 1997.\n\nQuestion: Where did William S.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Ian Hunter (singer)) Ian Hunter Patterson (born 3 June 1939), known as Ian Hunter, is an English singer-songwriter and musician who is best known as the lead singer of the English rock band Mott the Hoople, from its inception in 1969 to its dissolution in 1974, and at the time of its 2009 and 2013 reunions. Hunter was a musician and songwriter before joining Mott the Hoople, and continued in this vein after he left the band. He embarked on a solo career despite ill health and disillusionment with commercial success, and often worked in collaboration with Mick Ronson, David Bowie's sideman and arranger from the \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" period. Mott the Hoople achieved a certain level of commercial success, and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter charted with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. His best-known solo songs are \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\", later covered by Great White, and \"England Rocks\" , which was modified to \"Cleveland Rocks\" and then later covered by The Presidents of the United States of America, and became one of the theme songs used for the American TV series \"The Drew Carey Show\".\nDocument[2](Title: Hunter (Bj\u00f6rk song)) \"Hunter\" is a song recorded by Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk for her third studio album \"Homogenic\" (1997). The lyrics explore the pressure Bj\u00f6rk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of \"Homogenic\"; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Bj\u00f6rk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most music critics were enticed by \"Hunter\", which they declared one of the highlights of the \"Homogenic\" album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video for \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Bj\u00f6rk as she transforms into a \"techno-bear\" while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics.

The son of the popular Roman general Germanicus and Augustus's granddaughter Agrippina the Elder, Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Germanicus's uncle and adoptive father, Tiberius, succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in 14 AD. Although he was born Gaius Caesar, after Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" ( meaning \"little [soldier's] boot\", the diminutive form of \"caliga\") from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of Capri, where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier. Following the death of Tiberius, Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37. There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province. In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius, the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of his nephew Nero in 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line.\nDocument[2](Title: Lollia Paulina) Lollia Paulina, also known as Lollia Paullina (15-49) was a Roman Empress for six months in 38 as the third wife and consort of the Roman emperor Caligula.

According to most ancient authors, Arruns and his brother were the sons of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king, and Tanaquil. However, in some sources they are described as grandsons; their father may have been a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius, who according to an Etruscan tradition was defeated and killed by the heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, together with a certain\" Macstarna\". Apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin word\" magister\", Macstarna has been identified with Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome. According to legend, Servius had come to the palace as a child, following the capture of Corniculum by Tarquinius Priscus. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, discovered his potential for greatness by various omens. When the elder Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil gave out that he was merely wounded, and installed Servius as regent, preferring him to her own sons. The Etruscan tradition may preserve an account of a revolt by Tarquin's sons against Servius' magistracy. Servius married a daughter of the elder Tarquin, and in turn he gave his own daughters to Arruns and Lucius Tarquinius. Arruns Tarquinius was mild and unassuming, while his brother was ambitious. Arruns' wife, known to history as Tullia Minor, as she was the younger daughter, was similarly ambitious, while her elder sister was not. Tullia sought to place her husband on the throne, which would require her father's death. But as Arruns lacked the ambition to overthrow his father- in- law, Tullia contrived his murder, and that of her own sister, that she might marry Lucius. Once these deeds were accomplished, she and Lucius plotted her father's destruction. With a sudden and bloody palace coup, the pair deposed and murdered the king, and Lucius seized the throne. Lucius' second son was named after his murdered brother; but it was the overweening pride and arrogance of Lucius' sons that brought about the downfall of the Roman monarchy. The younger Arruns fell in battle against the consul Lucius Junius Brutus in 509 BC.\n\nQuestion: Who was born earlier, Ra\u00fal Osorio or James B. Harris?": [

On 1 October 1674, he was created Earl of Northumberland, Baron of Pontefract (Yorkshire) and Viscount Falmouth (Cornwall). On 6 April 1683, he was created Duke of Northumberland. The first Duke of Northumberland was born at Merton College, Oxford. In 1682, he was employed on secret service in Venice. Upon his return to England in 1684, he was elected (10 January) and installed (8 April) Knight of the Garter. That summer, he served as a volunteer on the side of the French at the Siege of Luxembourg. In 1687, Northumberland commanded the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards. A year later, he was appointed a lord of His Majesty's bedchamber. In 1701, he was appointed Constable of Windsor Castle, in 1710 Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, and in 1712, he became Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire as well. In 1703, he succeeded the Earl of Oxford as Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse. Seven years later, on 10 January 1710, he became Lieutenant-General. On 7 April 1713, he was sworn into the Privy Council and as Chief Butler of England. In March 1686, Northumberland married Catherine Wheatley, the daughter of a poulterer, Robert Wheatley of Bracknell in Berkshire. Catherine was the widow of Thomas Lucy of Charlecote Park, a captain in the Royal Horse Guards. Soon after the marriage, Northumberland and his brother, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, allegedly attempted to privately convey her abroad to an English convent in Ghent, Belgium. After the death of Catherine in 1714, Northumberland remarried to Mary Dutton, the sister of Captain Mark Dutton. The Duke lived at Frogmore House at Windsor in Berkshire, but died suddenly aged 50 at Epsom on 28 June 1716. He had no legitimate offspring. Mary died at Frogmore House in 1738.\nDocument[2](Title: Charles II of England) Charles II (29 May 1630 \u2013 6 February 1685) was king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death. Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. After Charles I's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a \"de facto\" republic led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed. Charles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England, known as the \"Merry Monarch\", in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.\nDocument[3](Title: George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland) Lieutenant-General George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, KG, PC (28 December 1665 \u2013 28 June 1716) was the third and youngest illegitimate son of King Charles II of England; his mother was Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine (also known as Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland).

Virtually nothing is known about his rule in Chiny. In 1024, Reginbert, the Bishop of Verdun, appointed Louis as Count of Verdun when Count Herman of Ename, son of Godfrey the Prisoner, retired to a monastery. Herman's nephew, Godfrey the Bearded, coveted the position, and Gothelo (Herman\u2019s brother and Godfrey\u2019s father) invaded the city and murdered Louis. Louis married Adelaide (d. after 1025), of unknown parentage.

Although he probably did not use the title, Otto is regarded as the first Count of Chiny. Historically, an Otto of Vermandois is mentioned in a charter of 958 alongside his father, the Count of Vermandois. His name and that of his brother Ludolfe show a Germanic ancestry of the kings of the family of Saxony, which is indeed the case, as his mother is Gerberge of Lorraine, niece of Emperor Otto I (her mother being daughter to Henry the Fowler). He was reported as a quarrelsome lord who threatened Hainaut and Cambr\u00e9sis (the region around Cambrai). In 971, an Otto erected a fortress in Warcq, in the Ardennes, and attacked his neighbors, including Adalbero, Archbishop of Reims. He is mentioned as having imperial ancestry. This and a number of other facts prompted the historian L\u00e9on Vanderkindere to hypothesize that these two Ottos were in fact a single historical figure. His wife\u2019s name is unknown. It is possible that she was from Ardennes, a relative of Wigeric of Lotharingia and Cunigunda of France, granddaughter of Louis the Stammerer.

Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\u201383 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.\nDocument[2](Title: Joan of Kent) Joan, Countess of Kent( 29 September 1326/ 7 \u2013 7 August 1385), known to history as The Fair Maid of Kent, was the mother of King Richard II of England, whom she bore to her third husband Edward the Black Prince, son and heir apparent of King Edward III. Although the French chronicler Jean Froissart called her\" the most beautiful woman in all the realm of England, and the most loving\", the appellation\" Fair Maid of Kent\" does not appear to be contemporary. Joan inherited the titles 4th Countess of Kent and 5th Baroness Wake of Liddell after the death of her brother, John, 3rd Earl of Kent, in 1352.\nDocument[3](Title: Henry III of England) Henry III (1 October 1207 \u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death; however, he was not canonised.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mother of Edward I Of England?": [

In an effort to increase the Romanian work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. With the fall of Communism, many children from the orphanages moved into the streets while others were runaways from impoverished families. Today there are 20,000 children living in the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited. \" Children Underground\" follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children. Some of them landed in state- funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta' Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname' Macarena' derives from the song\" Macarena\", her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled. The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac. The filmmakers follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constan\u021ba. A similar scene films Ana and Marian as they visit their home, which is also outside Bucharest.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Anna-Liisa or Children Underground?": [

As Huey points out, \"Rape\" equally is an extended metaphor for Pharoahe's technical mastery of hip-hop. Personification and extended metaphor are techniques widely employed by hip-hop lyricists.

After studying law, he was admitted to the Suffolk Bar in Boston. He married Eliza Burret Wright of Cincinnati, and he moved there in the 1850s. In Ohio, Lord developed a reputation as a rehabilitator of railroad lines. In the 1850s, he served as president of the Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad. He succeeded William F.

But his views on slavery changed dramatically; he came to see it as \"not a moral evil\", but \"an ordinance of...God\", which \"providentially found a settlement in this country\". These views and his opposition to the Civil War, which he blamed on abolitionists,brought a storm of controversy, earning him the enmity of several members of the Dartmouth Board of Trustees, including Amos Tuck (1835), a founding member of the Republican Party and close friend of Abraham Lincoln. Matters came to a head in 1863 when the Trustees were deadlocked on awarding an honorary degree to President Lincoln, and Lord broke the tie by voting against it. The Trustees issued a statement: \"Neither the trustees nor the Faculty coincide with the president of the College in the views which he has published, touching slavery and the war; and it has been our hope that the College would not be judged a partisan institution by reason of such publications.\" Lord tendered his resignation.

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking.

His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent auteurs of the New Queer Cinema movement. Van Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with \"Mala Noche\" (1985). His second feature \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and New York Film Critics Circle and the award for Best Director from the National Society of Film Critics. His following film, \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), was similarly praised, as was the black comedy \"To Die For\" (1995), the drama \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997), and the biographical film \"Milk\" (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and both films received Best Picture nominations.

Van Sant also received the festival's Best Director Award that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers\u2014the other being Joel Coen\u2014to win both accolades at the festival in the same year. Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as \"Finding Forrester\" (2000) and \"Paranoid Park\" (2007), some of his efforts, such as the art house production \"Last Days\" (2005) and the environmental drama \"Promised Land\" (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his adaptation of Tom Robbins's \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" (1994), his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and \"The Sea of Trees\" (2015), were critical and commercial failures.

They originally played hardcore punk in the vein of bands such as Black Flag and The Circle Jerks. In 1998 they added second guitarist Lars Swenson and began cultivating a dirtier' 70s glam- rock sound, as heard on their eMpTy Records releases. The records sold fairly well and gained them the attention of larger labels such as DreamWorks and Sub Pop, the latter of whom signed the band to a recording contract in 1999. Over the course of their career they did extensive roadwork, touring North America and Europe with bands such as Sparta, Mudhoney, Run Run Run, Division of Laura Lee, and, often, the Murder City Devils. Waude and Swenson left the band in 2001 for other projects, and the Catheters continued as a 4- piece with longtime roadie Leo Gebhardt joining as bassist. In 2002, with the help of a popular music video, they scored an indie hit with the song\" Nothing\", from their album\" Static Delusions and Stone- Still Days\"( Sub Pop, 2002). After releasing more singles and touring heavily in 2002 and 2003, the band released the acclaimed album\" Howling ... It Grows and Grows !!!\" ( Sub Pop, 2004), which infused their earlier sound with elements of classic rock. The Catheters played their final show on October 15, 2004 at Seattle's Sunset Tavern, joined by friends the Vells and blackbelt( who played some old- school Catheters covers), ending the show with a mass sing- along to their song'\" Fake ID\" which degenerated into instrument destruction and a minor brawl. The band dissolved amicably, with Brian Standeford and Davey Borozowski forming the group Tall Birds( later joined by Leo Gebhardt), while Derek Mason went on to play keyboards in the Girls and bass in Sunday Night Blackout. After Tall Birds disbanded, Standeford started Idle Times, while Borozowski went on to form the band Black Whales. Borozowski also tours with the popular indy rock band Modest Mouse as their percussionist/ second drummer, alongside Jeremiah Green. Idle times has released two seven- inches, and Black Whales have an EP on Mt Fuji Records and a self- released full- length album. Mason's band the Girls are on Dirtnap Records.

Howard in the 1930s. Produced by Jetlag Productions and Sunbow Productions, the series debuted on September 13, 1992, ran for 65 episodes and concluded on November 22, 1993. The series was developed by Christy Marx who served as the sole story editor. The series was produced in association with Graz Entertainment for the first 13-episode season; AB Productions and Jean Chalopin's Cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et D\u00e9veloppement for the remaining episodes. The series also spawned a small toyline in 1992 created by Hasbro.

Howard) Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 \u2013 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding, eventually taking up amateur boxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death. Although a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was \"Weird Tales\", where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly-read author, with his best works still reprinted. Howard's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis his entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car and shot himself in the head.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the creator of Conan The Adventurer (1992 Tv Series)?": [

The original 1933 hit was performed by Freddy Martin, and the 1952 remake (inspired by the movie of the same name) was by the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, whose version made the Cashbox Top 50. Composer Alec Wilder writes, \"There are no two ways about it: this is a perfect theater song. If that sounds too reverent, then I'll reduce the praise to 'perfectly wonderful,' or else say that if it's not perfect, show me why it isn't.\" Freddy Martin and Henry King had the earliest hits of this song, at the very end of 1933.

Basie's 1955 recording is the most famous, and that particular performance was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. On this recording, trumpeter Thad Jones played his famous \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" solo, trombonist Benny Powell performed his much noted bridge, and Basie directs the band to play the short chorus \"one more time\" and then \"one more once.\" According to the niece of Matteo Boccino, \"April in Paris\" was composed on a 1931 Mathushek baby grand piano located in Boccino's 54th Street rehearsal hall as \"Walk a Little Faster\" prepared for its Broadway debut. During rehearsal, Duke concluded another song was needed and it was composed on the spot. Boccino's rehearsal studio was among dozens of buildings demolished in 1964 to make space for the still standing New York Hilton Hotel. The 1931 Mathushek baby grand is now owned by Michael Adams of Montville, New Jersey and many pianists have even recently played \"April in Paris\" on the very piano on which it was composed.

Born Hongli, the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 11 October 1735 to 8 February 1796. On 8 February, he abdicated in favour of his son, the Jiaqing Emperor\u2014a filial act in order not to reign longer than his grandfather, the illustrious Kangxi Emperor. Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power as the Retired Emperor until his death in 1799; he thus was one of the longest-reigning \"de facto\" rulers in the history of the world, and dying at the age of 87, one of the longest-lived. As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a large population and economy. As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms. This turned around in his late years: the Qing empire began to decline with corruption and wastefulness in his court and a stagnating civil society. A British valet who accompanied his diplomat master to the Qing court in 1793 described the emperor: The Emperor is about five feet ten inches in height, and of a slender but elegant form; his complexion is comparatively fair, though his eyes are dark; his nose is rather aquiline, and the whole of his countenance presents a perfect regularity of feature, which, by no means, announce the great age he is said to have attained; his person is attracting, and his deportment accompanied by an affability, which, without lessening the dignity of the prince, evinces the amiable character of the man. His dress consisted of a loose robe of yellow silk, a cap of black velvet with a red ball on the top, and adorned with a peacock's feather, which is the peculiar distinction of mandarins of the first class.

His musical style is often considered a blend of Southern rock, blues, and country. He is the son of country music singer Hank Williams, the half-brother of Jett Williams, and the father of Hank Williams III, Holly Williams, Hilary Williams, Sam Williams and Katie Williams. Williams began his career following in his famed father's, Hank Williams, footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a 1964 episode of ABC's \"The Jimmy Dean Show\", in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ABC's \"Shindig!\". Williams' style evolved slowly as he struggled to find his own voice and place within country music. This was interrupted by a near-fatal fall off the side of Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975. After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues. Williams enjoyed much success in the 1980s, from which he earned considerable recognition and popularity both inside and outside country music. As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums. From 1989 through October 2011, and since 2017, his song \" All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,\" refashioned as \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night,\" was used to open broadcasts of \"Monday Night Football\".\nDocument[2](Title: Anthemius) Anthemius (\u2013 11 July 472) was Western Roman Emperor from 467 to 472. Perhaps the last capable Western Roman Emperor, Anthemius attempted to solve the two primary military challenges facing the remains of the Western Roman Empire: the resurgent Visigoths, under Euric, whose domain straddled the Pyrenees; and the unvanquished Vandals, under Geiseric, in undisputed control of North Africa. Anthemius was killed by Ricimer, his own general of Gothic descent, who contested power with him.\nDocument[3](Title: Anthemiolus) Anthemiolus (died c. 471 AD) was the son of the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius (467\u2013472) and Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern Roman emperor Marcian. His name means \"little Anthemius\" and is a diminutive of his and his father's name Anthemius, in order to distinguish them both. His life is known only from the \"Chronica Gallica of 511\". He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals \u2014 Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus \u2014 in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives. The \"Chronica\", in entry 649, states: Antimolus a patre Anthemio imperatore cum Thorisario, Everdingo et Hermiano com. stabuli Arelate directus est, quibus rex Euricus trans Rhodanum occurrit occisisque ducibus omnia vastavit Antimolus was sent by his father, Emperor Anthemius, to Arles, with Thorisarius, Everdingus and Hermanius, \"comes\" [or \"comitesstabuli\": King Euric met them on the far side of the Rhone and, having killed the \"duces\", laid everything waste. According to the \"Chronica\", this event falls between the succession of Euric (467) and the war between Anthemius and Ricimer (471\u2013472). It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near D\u00e9ols. It is not impossible that Anthemiolus' army was sent to reinforce Riothamus and that Euric defeated both forces in turn, probably in either 470 or 471.\n\nQuestion: Which country Anthemiolus's father is from?": [

Rising artists Valens, Richardson and Dion and the Belmonts had joined the tour as well. The long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of flu and even frostbite. After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by such conditions, Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Richardson, who had the flu, swapped places with Jennings, taking his seat on the plane, while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss.\nDocument[3](Title: Waylon Jennings) Waylon Arnold Jennings (June 15, 1937 \u2013 February 13, 2002) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. Jennings began playing guitar at age eight and began performing at age twelve on KVOW radio, after which he formed his first band, The Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and bounced around as a performer and DJ on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI, KLLL, in Coolidge, Arizona, and Phoenix. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings's first recording session, and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the ill-fated flight in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, J. P. \" The Big Bopper\" Richardson and Ritchie Valens. Jennings formed a rockabilly club band, The Waylors, which became the house band at \"JD's\", a club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and A&M Records, but did not achieve success until moving to RCA Victor, taking on Neil Reshen as a manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts for him. After finally wresting creative control from RCA Victor, his career turning point became the critically acclaimed albums \"Lonesome, On'ry and Mean\" and \"Honky Tonk Heroes\", followed by hit LPs \"Dreaming My Dreams\" and \"Are You Ready for the Country\". During the 1970s, Jennings was instrumental in the inception of outlaw country and with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter recorded country music's first platinum album, \"Wanted! The Outlaws\". It was followed by \"Ol' Waylon\" and the hit song \"Luckenbach, Texas\". Jennings was featured in the 1978 album \"White Mansions\", performed by various artists documenting the lives of people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Jennings also appeared in films and television series, including Sesame Street, and a stint as the balladeer for \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", composing and singing the show's theme song and providing narration for the show. By the early 1980s, Jennings struggled with a cocaine addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album \"Will the Wolf Survive\". He toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. In 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

The magazine was originally known as \"Harp Magazine\" for over 10 years, also based in Silver Spring, and was considered one of the best music magazines of the decade in the early 2000s. After \"Harp\" folded in March 2008 (at the behest of its parent company, which also owned JazzTimes, it declared bankruptcy), \"Blurt\" was founded by \"Harp\" owner Scott Crawford. Some of the main writers and editors for \"Harp\" also started \"Blurt\" with Crawford, including managing editor Fred Mills (of Asheville, NC, and also a contributing editor to \"StereophileMagnet\" and other music industry publications and alternative weeklies), senior editor Randy Harward (also an editor for the Salt Lake City weekly paper), and senior editor Andy Tennille (a journalist and photographer, currently the photographer for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers). \"Blurt\"s tag line is \"Real Music, Real Artists, Real OpinionsBlurt\" is a highly respected outlet within the music industry and has often been cited by critics and fans as the \"Mojo\" magazine of the United States. It initially launched as an all-digital, downloadable online magazine, publishing five issues in that format before moving to print for the next nine issues while also posting each issue online, frequently with expanded content, at BlurtOnline.com. In early 2010, Crawford sold the \"Blurt\" assets to Stephen Judge of Second Motion Entertainment and the company moved to the label's home of Carrboro, NC. Second Motion Entertainment also owns the record label Second Motion Records which works with such artists as Australia's The Church, Bettie Serveert, Swervedriver, Parson Red Heads and Tommy Keene. \"Blurt\" magazine announced in February 2012 that it would be relocating its offices (along with Second Motion) to Raleigh, NC, where Judge had purchased long-tenured independent record store Schoolkids Records. Editor Mills also relocated to Raleigh, assisting Judge in both running the store and publishing the magazine. As of April 2017, Schoolkids also operates locations in Durham, NC, and Carrboro, NC, and the Second Motion Records name has been changed to Schoolkids Records. The magazine, label and stores are increasingly integrated, operationally. \"Blurt\" is updated daily with new music interviews, essays and features; music news, record release announcements (vinyl is a specialty), and tour dates; exclusive videos, audio streams and bootleg MP3s; record, DVD, book and concert reviews; and blog entries by Judge, Mills, John B. Moore, Michael Toland, and Bill Kopp. Tim Hinely, founder of \"Dagger\", a punk and indie zine first published in 1987 and still in print, and recognized by \"Pitchfork\" as \"one of the best,\" is also a contributor.

At that point the magazine decided to revert to publishing online in the face of declining advertising revenue. While operating as a print publication, covers were devoted to artists such as: Sonic Youth, The Avett Brothers, PJ Harvey, Of Montreal, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Spiritualized Grizzly Bear and Wilco.

He was the son of Christian III, Count of Oldenburg and Hedwig von Oldenburg in Wildeshausen. John married twice. His first marriage was to Elisabeth, the daughter of John, Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg and Liutgard von Holstein-Itzehoe. His second marriage was to Countess Hedwig of Diepholz. John had five children:\nJohn II of Oldenburg is also the patriline ancestor of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and thus of Charles, Prince of Wales and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.\nDocument[2](Title: Jacob, Margrave of Baden-Baden) Jacob I of Baden (15 March 1407, Hachberg \u2013 13 October 1453, M\u00fchlburg), was Margrave of Baden-Baden from 1431 to 1453. He was the elder son of Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden and his second wife Anna of Oettingen. Jacob I was a man of deep religious beliefs, well known as a founder of churches. He founded the monastery at Fremersberg and was a major benefactor of the Stiftskirche at Baden-Baden. According to his father's precepts, only two of his sons were to be considered heirs of the margravate. Therefore, only Charles and Bernard received a secular education; the other children had a strict religious upbringing. George, after taking a religious profession in his youth, returned briefly to the world, but in 1454 reverted to\nholy orders and later became Bishop of Metz. Jacob I was the opposite of his father; Enea Silvio de Piccolomini (Pope Pius II) characterized him as \"famous among the Germans for his justice and intelligence\". In his early years he was ruler of the family possessions in Hohenberg, until at the age of 24 he succeeded to the government of Baden. He was described as a pugnacious knight and a frugal father of the state and was popular among the princes as a mediator. Both Emperor Sigismund and Emperor Frederick III, under whom he served, thought highly of him. When as the result of a miscarriage his sister Agnes fled in the middle of a conflict about inheritance, the Margrave lost his claim to the Duchy of Schleswig. He was so angry that he confined Agnes for the rest of her life in Eberstein Castle in Ebersteinburg. (The incident is remembered as the \"Double Disaster of Gottorf\"). When in 1427 the Treaty of Sponheim came into force, he gained possessions on the Moselle. In 1442 he bought for 30,000 guilders from the descendants of Walter von Geroldseck half the lordship of Lahr and Mahlberg.\nDocument[3](Title: John II of Baden) John II of Baden (1434 at Hohenbaden Castle in Baden-Baden \u2013 9 February 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein) was a titular Margrave of Baden and was Archbishop and Elector of Trier as \"John II of Baden\" from 1456 until his death in 1503. John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as \"John II of Baden\". His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II's reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law. In 1477, he officiated in the wedding of Maximilian of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co-adjutor with the right to succeed  and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier.

On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Meritaten) Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten or Meryetaten (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth dynasty. Her name means \"She who is beloved of Aten\"; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name, Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.\nDocument[2](Title: Akhenaten) Akhenaten (also spelled Echnaton, Akhenaton, Ikhnaton, and Khuenaten; meaning \"Effective for Aten\"), known before the fifth year of his reign as Amenhotep IV (sometimes given its Greek form, \"Amenophis IV\", and meaning \"Amun Is Satisfied\"), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, who ruled for 17 years and died perhaps in 1336 BC or 1334 BC. He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten (notably instead of Amun the temples of which he destroyed, the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources), which is sometimes described as monolatristic, henotheistic, or even quasi-monotheistic. An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars, and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god, giving the solar deity a status above mere gods. Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt's traditional religion, but the shifts were not widely accepted. After his death, his monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from the king lists. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors, referring to Akhenaten himself as \"the enemy\" or \"that criminal\" in archival records. The stele of Merneptah, on the one hand, values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to Ramses III (Merneptah), on the other hand, is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak. He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten, the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten, at Amarna. Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh, and a mummy found in the tomb KV55, which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton, is likely that of Akhenaten. DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun, but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned. Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun (even though Tutankhamun's mother was not Nefertiti, but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady), partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish.\nDocument[3](Title: Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit) Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two small princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Henry III of England) Henry III (1 October 1207 \u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death; however, he was not canonised.\nDocument[2](Title: Joan of Kent) Joan, Countess of Kent( 29 September 1326/ 7 \u2013 7 August 1385), known to history as The Fair Maid of Kent, was the mother of King Richard II of England, whom she bore to her third husband Edward the Black Prince, son and heir apparent of King Edward III. Although the French chronicler Jean Froissart called her\" the most beautiful woman in all the realm of England, and the most loving\", the appellation\" Fair Maid of Kent\" does not appear to be contemporary. Joan inherited the titles 4th Countess of Kent and 5th Baroness Wake of Liddell after the death of her brother, John, 3rd Earl of Kent, in 1352.\nDocument[3](Title: Edward I of England) Edward I (17/18 June 1239 \u2013 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\u201383 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I was a tall man (6'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Edward I Of England?": [

The film is a dark comedy of manners that wryly explores the life of a Berlin school teacher and the contrasts between his public and private lives. It was sexually explicit for general audiences of the day and for some time afterwards. So, for example, the film was not passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification until 2011, though it was widely shown in club cinemas. Taxi zum Klo was considered groundbreaking for its subject matter and achieved a cult status among audiences of the time. Shot on location with many characters appearing as themselves, the film documents gay culture in West Berlin in the brief moment post gay liberation and before the onset of AIDS, around 1980. Ripploh has stated that much of the film was autobiographical. The name literally means Taxi to the Toilet( or\" Cab to the Cottage\", etc.), that being a place for casual gay sex.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released first, Taxi Zum Klo or Saajan Bina Suhagan?": [

He was the oldest son of Sackville Fox of East Horsley, Surrey, and his wife Ann Holloway. His father died in 1760 and left him his estate in Surrey, worth about \u00a31,300 per year. Educated at Marylebone School, he was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge in 1771 and studied there until 1774. On 22 February 1773, he inherited the Bramham Park, Yorkshire estate of his paternal uncle George Fox-Lane, 1st Baron Bingley, and subsequently took the name of Fox-Lane. Through extravagance as a youth he became indebted to the moneylender Robert Mackreth. Mackreth bought Fox-Lane's Surrey estate very shortly after James came of age in 1777 and resold it for a handsome profit. He attempted to buy the Yorkshire estate as well, but the sale was cancelled by the Court of Chancery. Fox-Lane subsequently retained John Scott as counsel and sued Mackreth, alleging that Mackreth had defrauded him, and that the transactions had begun while Fox-Lane was still a minor. His suit was successful, and he was awarded the purchase money of the Surrey estate with interest and costs, totaling about \u00a320,000. Mackreth appealed, but the verdict was upheld by the Lord Chancellor and, in 1791, the House of Lords. On 23 July 1789, Fox-Lane married Hon. Marcia Lucy Pitt (1756\u20131822), the daughter of George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers. They had four sons and one daughter: On 5 May 1790, Fox-Lane was commissioned a lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Militia, of which his father-in-law was colonel. Although he had joined Brooks's Club, famously a society of Whigs, Fox-Lane had little interest in politics. Frances, the Dowager Viscountess of Irvine, was one of his Yorkshire neighbours, and in the 1796 election, returned him for one of the seats she controlled at Horsham. No known speech or vote on his part survives, and he did not stand at the 1802 election.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (28 August 1749 \u2013 22 March 1832) was a German writer and statesman. His works include: four novels; epic and lyric poetry; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; and treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived. A literary celebrity by the age of 25 , Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782 after taking up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (1774). He was an early participant in the \"Sturm und Drang\" literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace. Goethe's first major scientific work, the \"Metamorphosis of Plants\", was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\"; the verse epic \"Hermann and Dorothea\", and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, \"Faust\". His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\" one of the four greatest novels ever written, while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his work of the same name (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare). Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably Johann Peter Eckermann's \"Conversations with Goethe\" (1836).\nDocument[2](Title: Christiane Vulpius) Johanna Christiana Sophie Vulpius (1 June 1765 \u2013 6 June 1816) was the mistress and wife of Johann Wolfgang Goethe.\nDocument[3](Title: Silvio Spaventa) Spaventa died in Rome on 20 June 1893.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \"Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film, \"The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's \"Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\" (1925). \"The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, \"Wara Wara\" (1930) and \"Hacia la Gloria\" (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and \"Wara Wara\" remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is \"Amerindia\" (1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas. In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease. He and Hood moved to Houston for better medical care.

Although the Emperor Sigismund had invested the Duke of Berg with the duchy of Gelders, Arnold retained the confidence of the Estates by enlarging their privileges, and enjoyed the support of Duke Philip of Burgundy. Arnold was betrothed, and afterwards united in marriage to Catherine of Cleves, a niece of Philip of Burgundy. Subsequently, however, Duke Arnold fell out with his ally as to the succession to the see of Utrecht, whereupon Philip joined with the four chief towns of Guelders in the successful attempt of Arnold's son Adolf to substitute his own for his father's authority. Arnold gave up his claim on J\u0171lich only after his defeat in 1444 by Gerhard VII, Duke of J\u00fclich-Berg. When Charles the Bold became Duke of Burgundy in 1467, after rejecting a compromise, Adolph was thrown into prison. Arnold, against the will of the towns and the law of the land, pledged his duchy to Charles for 300,000 Rhenish florins (1471). Upon Arnold's death two years later at Grave, Charles took possession of the duchy, starting a series of wars that would last more than 70 years.\n\nQuestion: What is the date of death of Catherine Of Guelders's father?": [

Following the war he wrote a famous and horrifying testimony. Graebe gave the following eyewitness account: My foreman and I went directly to the pits. Nobody bothered us. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had got off the trucks- men, women and children of all ages- had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under -linen and clothing. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about eight persons, a man and a woman both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty- four, and two grown- up daughters about twenty- eight or twenty- nine. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one- year- old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family I have just mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said,\" twenty- three years old.\" I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was nearly two- thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy- gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them. Blood was running from their necks. The next batch was approaching already. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot. He later provided vital testimony in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, invoking bitter persecution from many of his countrymen. To escape the hostility, Graebe moved his family to San Francisco in 1948, where he lived until his death in 1986. Hermann Graebe was honoured as a' Righteous Among the Nations' by Yad Vashem. Another witness of the mass executions of October 1942 in Dubno was the German officer Axel von dem Bussche who, traumatised by what he had seen, in 1943 joined the German resistance around Claus von Stauffenberg and unsuccessfully tried to kill Adolf Hitler in a suicide attack in November 1943.\nDocument[2](Title: Louis-Ren\u00e9 de Caradeuc de La Chalotais) Louis- Ren\u00e9 de Caradeuc de La Chalotais( March 6, 1701 \u2013 July 12, 1785) was a French jurist who is primarily remembered for his role on the so- called\" Brittany Affair\", in which the Breton Parlement resisted the authority of the French monarchy over an issue of taxation.

During the reigns of the Fatherland Front and National Socialist German Workers Party, he risked his life as an activist in illegal trade unions. After Austria's liberation in 1945, having survived concentration camp, he continued to speak out against Fascism and National Socialism. On March 31, 1965, a demonstration of students, former resistance fighters and unions against Taras Borodajkewycz, a university professor accused of having made anti-Semitic statements, took place in Vienna, while the student organisation of the Freedom Party of Austria organized a riot. There were skirmishes between the participants of the two demonstrations; during one in which Kichweger was attacked by G\u00fcnther K\u00fcmel and severely injured. He died three days later, aged 67, as a result of his injuries. K\u00fcmel was sentenced to ten months in prison. 25,000 people attended Kirchweger's funeral. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering; his ashes are now buried in Hietzing Cemetery in Vienna. In 1990, the\" Wielandschule\" in Vienna- Favoriten, a building owned by the Communist Party, was seized by left- wing activists and named Ernst- Kirchweger- Haus.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: James Adam (architect)) James Adam (21 July 1732 \u2013 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived \u2014 he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773\u20131778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).\nDocument[2](Title: James Adam (classicist)) James Adam( 1860\u20131907) was a Scottish classicist who taught Classics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.\nDocument[3](Title: William Adam (architect)) William Adam (1689 \u2013 24 June 1748) was a Scottish architect, mason, and entrepreneur. He was the foremost architect of his time in Scotland, designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings, and often acting as contractor as well as architect. Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh, and Duff House in Banff. His individual, exuberant style built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. In the 18th century, Adam was considered Scotland's \"Universal Architect\". However, since the early 20th century, architectural critics have taken a more measured view, Colin McWilliam, for instance, finding the quality of his work \"varied to an extreme degree\". As well as being an architect, Adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes, including coal mining, salt panning, stone quarries and mills. In 1731 he began to build up his own estate in Kinross-shire, which he named Blair Adam. He was the father of three architects; John, Robert and James, the last two were the developers of the \"Adam style\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of James Adam (Architect)'s father?": [

The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. Upon release, \"Absolute Beginners\" received immense coverage in the British media. At the time, the British film industry was perceived as being on the point of collapse (with the recent failure of the film \"Revolution\"). However, the film was panned by critics and became a box office bomb. Some of the criticisms included stylistic anachronisms, such as the mini-skirt and decidedly 1980s music from the likes of The Style Council and Sade, the bowdlerisation of Kensit's character (Crepe Suzette had been depicted as a promiscuous \"negrophile\" in the book), and the casting of Bowie, who made it a condition of his musical contribution. Although the film was not a success, Bowie's theme song was very popular in the UK and reached number two in the charts. The commercial failure of \"Absolute Beginners\" and another film released about the same time, \"The Mission\", led to the collapse of Goldcrest, a major British film studio.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Amelie Or The Time To Love or Beginners?": [

Although a controversial figure within the music industry, XXXTentacion has been regarded to have left behind \"a huge musical footprint\" due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his short career. He was often credited by critics and fans for his musical-versatility, with his music primarily exploring trap, R&B, rock and emo. Born in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, where he soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. XXXTentacion rose to mainstream fame with the single \"Look at Me\". His debut album, \"17\" (2017), debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 and his second album,  (2018), debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. Both albums have been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice \u2014 they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition. The winner would get her face on the cover of \"Seventeen magazine\", a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly \u2014 Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons \u2014 video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest. The way the girls would generally find out who was eliminated was by sitting around a TV as Atoosa would talk to them, telling them the results of the tasks they were given. The TV screen would then display the names of the girls who would be staying in the house, written in cursive form. The girl whose name didn't appear on 'The List' was eliminated, and met with Atoosa to hear her reasoning for why she was eliminated.

Both Queen Hetepheres II and Pharaoh Khafra have been suggested as children of Meretites I and Khufu as well, and it is possible that Meritites II was a daughter of Meritites I as well.

He is generally accepted as having commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but many other aspects of his reign are poorly documented. The only completely preserved portrait of the king is a three-inch high ivory figurine found in a temple ruin of a later period at Abydos in 1903. All other reliefs and statues were found in fragments, and many buildings of Khufu are lost. Everything known about Khufu comes from inscriptions in his necropolis at Giza and later documents. For example, Khufu is the main character noted in the Westcar Papyrus from the 13th dynasty. Most documents that mention king Khufu were written by ancient Egyptian and Greek historians around 300 BC. Khufu's obituary is presented there in a conflicting way: while the king enjoyed a long-lasting cultural heritage preservation during the period of the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom, the ancient historians Manetho, Diodorus and Herodotus hand down a very negative depiction of Khufu's character.

It stars Dustin Hoffman, in his first movie role, as Jason Fister, a young U.S. Treasury Dept. official sent to Rome to recover a large sum of money owed to the United States government by a deceased mobster. The film is in the lowbrow comedy genre, with comic stop- action chase scenes, as well as many scenes involving spaghetti western- style gunplay on the streets of Rome.

He wrote hundreds of country, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", is included on \"Mojo\" magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. Songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Robert Hunter, Harry Chapin, John Mellencamp, Pete Seeger, Andy Irvine, Joe Strummer, Billy Bragg, Jerry Garcia, Jay Farrar, Bob Weir, Jeff Tweedy, Bob Childers, Sammy Walker, Tom Paxton, AJJ, Brian Fallon, and Sixto Rodr\u00edguez have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence. He frequently performed with the slogan \"This machine kills fascists\" displayed on his guitar. Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in Okemah, Oklahoma, until he was 14, when his mother Mary was hospitalized as a consequence of Huntington's disease, a fatal hereditary neurological disorder. His father moved to Pampa, Texas, to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. During his early teens, Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents' friends. He married at 19, but with the advent of the dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station KFVD, achieving some fame from playing hillbilly music; made friends with Will Geer and John Steinbeck; and wrote a column for the communist newspaper \"People's World\" from May 1939 to January 1940. Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, although he did not appear to belong to any. With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings. He left the station, ending up in New York where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\". In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song, \" This Land Is Your Land\". He said it was a response to what he felt was the overplaying of Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America\" on the radio. Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son Arlo Guthrie became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of Huntington's disease. His first two daughters also died of the disease. During his later years, in spite of his illness, Guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement, providing inspiration to a generation of new folk and country musicians, including mentoring Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan.\n\nQuestion: Why did the performer of song Ludlow Massacre (Song) die?": [

During a 60 year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include \"Fa\u00e7ade\", the cantata \"Belshazzar's Feast\", the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems \"Crown Imperial\" and \"Orb and Sceptre\". Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, \"Fa\u00e7ade\", which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, \"Troilus and Cressida\", was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.\nDocument[2](Title: Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Henry) Fran\u00e7ois-Louis( Ferdinand) Henry( 12 May 1786 \u2013 22 February 1855) was a French baritone, who sang for about 35 years with the Op\u00e9ra- Comique in Paris, where he created numerous leading roles.

Produced by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair, the song was released as the only promotional single from the film's on June 5, 2001. Directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale agreed that \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\", their third animated Disney project, would not be a musical. However, the studio's marketing department insisted that at least one song be featured during the film's end credits in order to adhere to tradition. Disney hired M\u00fda to record a pop song for the \"Atlantis\" soundtrack because of the studio and singer's shared business relationship with A&M/ Interscope Records. A downtempo pop and R&B ballad, \"Where the Dream Takes You\" is an inspirational song about following one's heart and self-discovery, which alludes to the film's central plot about a young adventurer's search for the lost city of Atlantis. Both Warren and Howard collaborated on the song's melody, which borrows from Howard's own orchestral score, while Warren wrote the lyrics. \"Where the Dream Takes You\" is the only song from \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" that features both music and lyrics.

She was born and raised in the London Borough of Islington in London, where she attended the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology. Lewis achieved national recognition when she won the third series of \"The X Factor\" in 2006, winning a \u00a31 million recording contract with Simon Cowell's record label, Syco Music. Her winner's single, a cover of Kelly Clarkson's \"A Moment Like This\", peaked at number one for four weeks on the UK Singles Chart and broke a world record for reaching 50,000 digital downloads within 30 minutes. In February 2007, Lewis signed a five-album contract in the United States with Clive Davis's record label, J Records. Lewis's success continued with the release of her debut album, \"Spirit\", in 2007; it was certified 10\u00d7 platinum in the United Kingdom and became the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s. It is one of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In the US, Lewis became the first UK solo artist to debut at number one with a debut album, with \"Spirit\". The lead single, \"Bleeding Love\", spent seven weeks at number one in the UK where it became the best-selling single of 2007. She achieved international recognition with the album in 2008 when it topped charts around the world. \" Spirit\" has sold more than eight million copies worldwide, and \"Bleeding Love\" peaked at number one in over 30 countries, including the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the best-selling single of 2008. As a result, she was proclaimed Top New Artist by \"Billboard\" in 2008. Under the guidance of Cowell and Davis, Lewis released her second UK number-one album \"Echo\" and recorded the theme song for the film \"Avatar\" in 2009. She embarked on her first UK arena tour, The Labyrinth, in 2010. In 2011, Lewis released the non-album single \"Collide\", a collaboration with Swedish DJ Avicii, and her first extended play, . Her third album, \"Glassheart\", was released in 2012. It marked a new creative direction for Lewis, drawing inspiration from dubstep and electronic music. However, it failed to match the commercial performance of her two previous albums, peaking at number three in the UK and becoming her first to not be certified platinum. Lewis began to record material for her first Christmas album during her Glassheart Tour, which took place in mid 2013. \" Christmas, with Love\" was released later that year. Its lead single, \"One More Sleep\", peaked at number three in the UK. With this chart entry, Lewis became the first British female solo artist to reach the top five with eight singles, surpassing Olivia Newton-John's record of seven. In 2014, Lewis made her film debut in the supporting role of Elena in the romantic comedy musical, \"Walking on Sunshine\". Her fourth studio album, \"I Am\", was released the following year. In 2016, Lewis made her Broadway debut as Grizabella in the revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \"Cats\". A year later, she signed a modelling contract with Wilhelmina Models. She then collaborated with Calum Scott on the single \"You Are The Reason\" (2018) which achieved worldwide chart success, and had a recurring role in the American television series \"The Oath\" (2019). As of 2015, Lewis is the second best-selling act from \"The X Factor\" franchise in the UK, behind One Direction, having sold over 30 million records worldwide. The OCC recognises Lewis as the most successful winner from the UK's \"The X Factor\". Lewis has won two MOBO Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award, and two World Music Awards. She is also a six-time Brit Award and three-time Grammy Award nominee. Lewis is known for her expansive four-octave vocal range, power, technical control and, in particular, her frequent use of the falsetto register.

A prolific author, he had his first book, a biography of Khama III, accepted for publication while still in high school at Lovedale. This book was later quashed by the Bechuanaland Protectorate authorities and was not published. He was banished from the Bangwato Reserve in 1937 after Tshekedi Khama, the Bangwato regent accused Raditladi of adultery with his wife as well as for conspiring to bewitch him. After that Raditladi served as a colonial service clerk and quickly became the highest ranking Motswana in the Protectorate. Following his experiences with Tshekedi, Raditladi wrote his historical drama Motswasele II, his most famous work. The major theme of this work is with royal despotism and the perverted results of such tyranny. In 1944 the Batawana Kgosi Moremi III asked the British to appoint Raditladi as the head of the Tsetse Fly Control agency in Ngamiland. As such he became the first Motswana to head a government department. Two years later, Moremi appointed him Tribal Secretary. This appointment occurred just before Moremi's death, following which the chief was succeeded by his wife, the regent EP Moremi. Raditladi and the Regent, both foreign- born, exercised tight control over Ngamiland and quickly aroused resentment. Their clandestine love affair also become public knowledge. In late 1950 the Regent was forced to abort Raditladi's child, an event that led Raditladi's opponents to drive him out of Ngamiland at gunpoint. During the 1940s Raditladi was instrumental in establishing the sport of soccer in Botswana, and was behind the formation of leagues in both the northern and southern parts of the country. In 1958 after his return to Serowe Raditladi founded the Bechuanaland Protectorate Federal Party. Raditladi had for years been writing political newspaper columns under the pseudonym\" Observer\", but his journalistic abilities did not translate into successful politics. After his party was eclipsed by other nationalist movements he moved to the sidelines and played a minimal role in the run up to independence in 1966. Raditladi wrote several historical plays, love stories and poems.

In 1870, he discovered one of the most important units of Cenozoic fossils in Brazil: Pirabas. He also made important archaeological discoveries that 20th century archaeologists confirmed. In three letters published by the National Museum( 1876 a, 1876 b, 1877), recorded his observations on the shell mounds installed in the dark and swampy regions on the east coast of Para, which he excavated, measured, and mapped, making notes on their condition, conservation, and archeological conditions- human bones, lithic and ceramic artefacts- describing them and locating them in their stratigraphic layers. He correctly identified the coastal and riverine shellmounds of Para as villages inhabited by early fishing people, an insight that scientific archaeologists confirmed in the 1990s. Always sharing his knowledge with other scholars, he urged geologist Charles Hartt to study the shellmound of Taperinha. About 100 years later, Taperinha and several other fluvial shellmounds with pottery in the Lower Amazon were shown through radiocarbon dating and luminescence dating to be early Holocene in age, c. 9.000 to 7,000 BP calibrated, making them the earliest pottery sites yet known in the Americas and among the earliest in the world.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Skanderbeg) Gjergj Kastrioti (6 May 1405 \u2013 17 January 1468), known as Skanderbeg (or \"Sk\u00ebnderbeu\" from), was an Albanian nobleman and military commander who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia. A member of the noble Kastrioti family, he was sent to the Ottoman court as hostage, where he was educated and entered the service of the Ottoman sultan for the next twenty years. He rose through the ranks, culminating in the appointment as \"sanjakbey\" (governor) of the Sanjak of Dibra in 1440. In 1443, he deserted the Ottomans during the Battle of Ni\u0161 and became the ruler of Kruj\u00eb, Svetigrad, and Modri\u010d. In 1444, he was appointed the chief commander of the short-lived League of Lezh\u00eb that consolidated nobility throughout what is today Northern Albania. Thus, for the first time Albania was united under a single leader. Skanderbeg's rebellion was not a general uprising of Albanians, because he did not gain support in the Venetian-controlled north or in the Ottoman-controlled south. His followers included, apart from Albanians, also Slavs, Vlachs, and Greeks. Despite this military valor he was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in nowadays northern Albania where almost all of his victories against the Ottomans took place. His rebellion was a national rebellion. The resistance led by him brought Albanians of different regions and dialects together in a common cause, helping define the ethnic identity of the Albanians. Skanderbeg's military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion, and he was considered by many in western Europe to be a model of Christian resistance against Muslims. For 25 years, from 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000 man army marched through Ottoman territory winning against consistently larger and better supplied Ottoman forces, for which he was admired. Skanderbeg always signed himself in (\"Lord of Albania\"), and claimed no other titles but that in documents. In 1451, he recognized \"de jure\" the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Naples over Albania through the Treaty of Gaeta, to ensure a protective alliance, although he remained a \"de facto\" independent ruler. In 1460\u201361, he participated in Italy's civil wars in support of Ferdinand I of Naples. In 1463, he became the chief commander of the crusading forces of Pope Pius II, but the Pope died while the armies were still gathering. Together with Venetians he fought against the Ottomans during the Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u20131479) until his death in January 1468. He ranks high in that military history, as the most persistent opponent of the Ottoman Empire in its heyday who was also ever-victorious.\nDocument[2](Title: Gjon Kastrioti II) John Castriot II( 1456 \u2013 1502), was the son of Skanderbeg, the Albanian national hero, and of Donika Kastrioti, daughter of Gjergj Arianiti.

Following Ja'far's death, the Shia community split between those who believed the Imamate was passed to Musa ibn Ja'far, who would become the Twelver Shia, and those who believed that the Imamate passed to Isma'il ibn Ja'far, who would become the Isma'ili branch named after Isma'il.\nDocument[2](Title: Ja'far al-Sadiq) Ja\u02bffar ibn Mu\u1e25ammad a\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101diq (700 or 702\u2013765 CE), commonly known as Ja'far al-\u1e62\u0101diq or simply as-Sadiq (The Truthful), was an 8th-century Muslim scholar and scientist. He is considered as an Imam and founder of the Ja'fari school of jurisprudence by Twelver and Isma'ili Shi\u2019as, and a major figure in the Hanafi and Maliki schools of Sunni jurisprudence. He was a descendant of the Caliph Ali and Fatimah bint Muhammad on the side of his father, Muhammad al-Baqir, and of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr on the maternal side of his family, Umm Farwah bint al-Qasim. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was raised by Ali, but was not his son. Ali used to say: \"Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr is my son but from Abu Bakr's lineage\". Al-Sadiq is the 6th Imam for Twelvers, is recognized by the majority of the Shi\u2019a as an Imam, and is revered in Sunni Islam as a transmitter of hadiths, therefore a prominent jurist, and a mystic to Sufis. Despite his wide-ranging attributions in a number religious disciplines, no works penned by Ja'far himself remain extant. Al-Sadiq was born in either 700 or 702 CE. He inherited the position of imam from his father in his mid-thirties. As a Shi\u2019a Imam, al-Sadiq stayed out of the political conflicts that embroiled the region, evading the many requests for support that he received from rebels. He was the victim of some harassment by the Abbasid caliphs, and was eventually, according to Shi\u2019a Muslims, poisoned at the orders of the Caliph Al-Mansur. In addition to his connection with Sunni schools of Sunni jurisprudence, he was a significant figure in the formulation of Shia doctrine. The traditions recorded from al-Sadiq are said to be more numerous than all hadiths recorded from all other Shia imams combined. As the founder of Ja'fari jurisprudence, al-Sadiq also elaborated the doctrine of \"Nass\" (divinely inspired designation of each imam by the previous imam), and \"Ismah\" (the infallibility of the imams), as well as that of Taqiyyah. The question of succession after al-Sadiq's death was the cause of division among Shi\u2019a who considered his eldest son, Isma'il (who had reportedly died before his father) to be the next Imam, and those who believed his third son Musa al-Kadhim was the imam. The first group became known as the Ismailis and the second, larger, group was named Ja'fari or the Twelvers.\nDocument[3](Title: Isma'il ibn Ja'far) Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl ibn Ja\u02bffar al-Mub\u0101rak (c. born: 719 AD, Medina - died circa 762 AD, Medina) was the eldest son of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq.

A member of the Republican Party, he held office during the onset of the Great Depression. Prior to serving as president, Hoover led the Commission for Relief in Belgium, served as the director of the U.S. Food Administration, and served as the 3rd U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Born to a Quaker family in West Branch, Iowa, he grew up in Oregon. Hoover took a position with a London-based mining company after graduating from Stanford University in 1895. After the outbreak of World War I, he became the head of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, an international relief organization that provided food to occupied Belgium. When the U.S. entered the war, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover to lead the Food Administration, and Hoover became known as the country's \"food czar\". After the war, Hoover led the American Relief Administration, which provided food to the inhabitants of Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Hoover's war-time service made him a favorite of many progressives, and he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 1920 presidential election. After the 1920 election, newly-elected Republican President Warren G. Harding appointed Hoover as Secretary of Commerce; Hoover continued to serve under President Calvin Coolidge after Harding died in 1923. Hoover was an unusually active and visible cabinet member, becoming known as \"Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments\". He was influential in the development of radio and air travel and led the federal response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. Hoover won the Republican nomination in the 1928 presidential election, and decisively defeated the Democratic candidate, Al Smith. The stock market crashed shortly after Hoover took office, and the Great Depression became the central issue of his presidency. Hoover pursued a variety of policies in an attempt to lift the economy, but opposed directly involving the federal government in relief efforts. In the midst of an ongoing economic crisis, Hoover was decisively defeated by Democratic nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Hoover enjoyed one of the longest retirements of any former president, and he authored numerous works. After leaving office, Hoover became increasingly conservative, and he strongly criticized Roosevelt's foreign policy and New Deal domestic agenda. In the 1940s and 1950s, Hoover's public reputation was rehabilitated as he served for Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower in various assignments, including as chairman of the Hoover Commission.

Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.\nDocument[2](Title: Ankhesenpepi IV) Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.\nDocument[3](Title: Pepi II Neferkare) Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC \u2013 after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (\"Nefer-ka-Re\"), means \"Beautiful is the Ka of Re\". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks\u2014the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II\u2014were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: \"King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II\". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?": [

He is the longest-serving governor in Massachusetts history and only the second Greek-American governor in U.S. history, after Spiro Agnew. He was nominated by the Democratic Party for president in the 1988 election, losing to the Republican candidate, Vice President George H. W. Bush. Born in Brookline, Massachusetts to Greek and Aromanian Greek immigrants, Dukakis attended Swarthmore College before enlisting in the United States Army. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving from\n1963 to 1971. He won the 1974 Massachusetts gubernatorial election but lost his 1978 bid for re-nomination to Edward J. King. He defeated King in the 1982 gubernatorial primary and served as governor from 1983 to 1991, presiding over a period of economic growth known as the \"Massachusetts Miracle\". Building on his popularity as governor, Dukakis sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 presidential election. He prevailed in the Democratic primaries and was formally nominated at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Dukakis chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running mate, while the Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of George H. W. Bush and Senator Dan Quayle. Dukakis lost the election, carrying only ten states and Washington, D.C., but he improved on the Democratic performances in the previous two elections. After the election, Dukakis announced that he would not seek another term as governor, and he left office in 1991. Since leaving office, Dukakis has served on the board of directors for Amtrak and has taught political science at Northeastern University and UCLA. He was mentioned as a potential appointee to the Senate in 2009 to fill the vacancy caused by Ted Kennedy's death, but Governor Deval Patrick chose Paul G. Kirk.

It was the first feature film to be created in Poland following the six years of World War II. The film, set during the German occupation of Warsaw during the war, tells the story of several inhabitants of the same tenement house. Their stories are loosely tied together by a set of songs, both pre-war ballads popular during the war and war-time popular songs mocking German occupation (\"Siekiera, motyka\"). The film's premiere took place on 8 January 1947 in the newly reopened cinema in Warsaw. The film proved to be highly popular and more than 10.8 million people watched it in the following three years - twice the usual average attendance in post-war Poland. In 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released in a new version, with more focus on Red Army's role as the \"liberator\" of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as more grim outlook of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general. Main differences: However, as the farcical plot and all-familiar songs were mostly free of ideological subtexts, the film remained popular in the decades to come and some of its songs re-emerged in slightly modified form during the 1980s martial law and struggle against the Communist rule. The film remains well-known and popular even in modern Poland, being screened by the public Polish Television (TVP) on a regular basis.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Huchtenburg) J( oh) an and Jacob van Huchtenburg( Hughtenburg or Hugtenburg( h)) were two Dutch Golden Age painters in the second half of the seventeenth century. Both brothers were natives of Haarlem, moved to Paris, but died in Amsterdam. The main source about their lives is from Arnold Houbraken. Some of the information from the 19th century is contradictive. Jacob van Huchtenburg( 1644, Haarlem- bur. January 8, 1675, Amsterdam) studied under Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem. In 1662 he went to Italy and stayed in Rome until 1667. On his way back to Holland he stayed in Paris for more than a year, where he probably met up with his brother Jan. In 1669 he joined the Haarlem artists' guild. His pictures are probably confounded with those of his brother. He became well- to- do and lived on Prinsengracht. One is in the Brukenthal Museum, Sibiu. Jan van Huchtenburg( bapt. November 20, 1647, Haarlem- bur. July 2, 1733, Amsterdam), was a famous Dutch horse and battle painter, like Esaias van de Velde and Philip Wouwermans. He was first taught by Thomas Wijck. On his way to visit his brother in Rome, he may not have got further than Paris, where he served under Antony Francis van der Meulen in the Manufacture des Gobelins employing him for illustrating, sketching or designing. In 1670 he settled at Haarlem, where he married Elisabeth Mommes. It seems he practised and kept a dealers shop in Haarlem or in the Hague. His style had now merged into an imitation of Wouwerman and Van der Meulen, which could not fail to produce pretty pictures of hunts and robber camps, the faculty of painting horses and men in action and varied dress being the chief point of attraction. Huchtenburg assisted Gerrit Berckheyde and painted his people and horses. Later Huchtenburg ventured on cavalry skirmishes and engagements of regular troops generally, and these were admired by Prince Eugene of Savoy and King William III, who gave the painter sittings, and commissioned him to throw upon canvas the chief incidents of the battles they fought upon the continent of Europe. When he died at Bloemgracht in the Jordaan in 1733, Huchtenburg had done much by his pictures and prints to make Prince Eugene, King William and Marlborough popular. Though clever in depicting a mile or a skirmish of dragoons, he remained second to Philip Wouvermans in accuracy of drawing, and inferior to Van der Meulen in the production of landscapes. But, nevertheless, he was a clever and spirited master, with great facility of hand and considerable natural powers of observation. The earliest date on his pictures is 1674, when he executed the Stag- Hunt in the Museum of Berlin, and the Fight with Robbers in the Liechtenstein Museum at Vienna. A Skirmish at Fleurus( 1690) in the Brussels gallery seems but the precursor of larger and more powerful works, such as the Siege of Namur( 1695) in the Belvedere at Vienna, where William III is seen in the foreground accompanied by Max Emmanuel, the Bavarian elector. Three years before, Huchtenburg had had sittings from Prince Eugene and William III. After 1696 he regularly served as court painter to Prince Eugene, and we have at[ a] Galleria Sabauda a series of ten or eleven canvases, all of the same size depicting the various battles of the great hero, commencing with the Battle of Zenta( 1697), Battle of Chiari( 1701), Battle of Luzzara( 1702), Battle of Blenheim( 1704), Battle of Cassano( 1705), Battle of Turin( 1706), Battle of Oudenaarde( 1708), Battle of Malplaquet( 1709), Battle of Petrovaradin( 1716) ending with the Battle of Belgrade( 1717). Had the Duke of Marlborough been fond of art he would doubtless have possessed many works of our artist. All that remained in 1911 at Blenheim Palace, however, was a couple of sketches of battles, which were probably sent to Churchill by his great contemporary. In 1911, the pictures of Huchtenburg were not very numerous in public galleries. There was one in the National Gallery, London, another at the Louvre. But Copenhagen had four, Dresden six, Gotha two, and Munich had the well- known composition of Tallart taken Prisoner at Blenheim in 1704.\nDocument[2](Title: Benjamin Nottingham Webster) Benjamin Nottingham Webster( 3 September 17973 July 1882) was an English actor-manager and dramatist.\nDocument[3](Title: T.

As a student at Oxford University, he first studied Greek vases that John Beazley had brought in, but soon switched to Menander and developed a lifelong interest in Greek comedy that resulted in\" reconstructions of the plots of lost plays and ... collections of evidence from widely disparate sources bearing on the history of the Greek theater\".

In 2009, Lucas was inducted into the GayVN Hall of Fame, noted for\" his stature as an A- list director and performer\". He was included in a 2009\" New York\" magazine feature about people who made it to the top, but arrived to the city with very little. Lucas is particularly well known for his activism and outspokenness. His criticism of drug use and his sponsorship of public service ad campaigns about the dangers of unprotected sex in the gay community led Harvey Fierstein to interview him for\" The Advocate\". His\" New York Blade\" columns on Ultra- Orthodox Judaism and Islam sparked a campus debate at Stanford University in February 2008 when Lucas was invited to give a speech to students. In 2010 he debated Peter Tatchell and Sue Sanders at England's Oxford University on whether the gay rights movement has undermined family values. In 2009, Lucas released the film\" Men of Israel\", which he called his most important. Journalists from\" The AtlanticOut Magazine\" and\" Yediot Aharonot\" noted it as a landmark film as the first pornographic movie shot on location with an all- Israeli cast; while\" Tablet Magazine\" and the\" Los Angeles Times\" remarked on it being the first to feature an all- Jewish cast. Lucas followed the film with a gay tour of Israel. New York's LGBT Center stopped allowing groups associated with the Israeli- Palestinian conflict to meet in their building after Lucas led a protest over their allowance of an anti-occupation group. In recent years Lucas has also begun work as a documentarian. In 2012, he released his first documentary film about the thriving Israeli LGBT community. Titled, the film includes footage of Tel Aviv's vibrant nightlife, a same- sex wedding, and candid interviews with a diverse range of local Israeli gays and lesbians, including a gay MP, an openly gay Army trainer, a drag queen, a transvestite, a young Arab- Israeli journalist, and same- sex parents raising their children and a number of artists and activists.

He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried.

Initial critical reception was negative due to excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers.

He was the son of Iyasu I and Empress Malakotawit. He is often referred to as\" Irgum Tekle Haymanot\" or\" Tekle Haymanot the Cursed\" Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana. With the support of his mother Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of king Kaleb, that Iyasu had abdicated, and crowned Tekle Haymanot\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" in Gondar. This act was not embraced by the entire state, and the resulting civil strife led to Iyasu's murder at the order of his son Tekle Haymanot. In September, 1707, a rebel in Gojjam declared himself\" n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" under the name Amda Seyon, and made his way to the capital city, where he had himself crowned. Tekle Haymanot quickly returned to Gondar, despite the difficulty of travel during the rainy season, forced the usurper to flee, and celebrated his triumph. Amda Seyon was later killed in battle in Maitsa. However his unpopularity for having ordered the murder of his widely revered father was profound and he never overcame it. The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or\" Era of the Princes\"( a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.\nDocument[2](Title: Tekle Haymanot II) Tekle Haymanot II (Ge'ez \u1270\u12ad\u1208 \u1203\u12ed\u121b\u1296\u1275, \"Anchor of the faith\"; 1754 \u2013 7 September 1777) was \"n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" as Admas Sagad III (Ge'ez \u12a0\u12f5\u121b\u1235 \u1230\u1308\u12f5 \"to whom the horizon bows\"; 18 October 1769 \u2013 13 April 1777) of Ethiopia, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the son of Yohannes II by \"Woizero\" Sancheviyar, at the Imperial prison of Mount Wehni. The Scots explorer James Bruce (who was in Ethiopia from September 1769 to November 1771) described his appearance as follows:\nDocument[3](Title: Yohannes II) Yohannes II or John II (Ge'ez \u12ee\u1213\u1295\u1235), (1699 \u2013 18 October 1769) was \"n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st\" of Ethiopia, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the son of Iyasu I, and brother of Emperors Tekle Haymanot I, Dawit III and Bakaffa. According to James Bruce, during the reign of his brother Bakaffa (1721-1730), the Emperor had vanished from view and a rumor circulated that Bakaffa had died. Qegnazmach Giyorgis acted on this by bringing Yohannes down from the royal prison on Wehni to rule, but before Yohannes could be proclaimed emperor, Bakaffa revealed himself and ordered the two men punished for their presumption, Giyorgis with death and Yohannes by having his hand cut off. However, in his edition of Bruce's work Alexander Murray replaced Bruce's words with a summary of the \"Royal Chronicle\", which records Yohannes had lost his hand for escaping from Wehni prior to this event, and instead, along with the other royal prisoners of Wehni, had refused to descend and be made Emperor. In either case, Yohannes did not become emperor during the 1720s or 1730s. Then, later, following the murder of Iyoas I in 1769, Ras Mikael Sehul summoned the late Emperor's great-uncle, Yohannes, from Wehni, although Yohannes must then have been in his seventies at least, and presented him to the royal council as his choice for Emperor. When one of the council pointed out that Yohannes lacked one of his hands (it had been cut off in punishment for attempting to escape from Wehni), Mikael replied that if Yohannes needed help mounting his horse, he himself would help Yohannes. Mikael married Yohannes to Mikael's own young granddaughter, Waletta Selassie. Yohannes' reign is succinctly recounted by E. A.

It was shot in agfacolor with sets designed by Otto Pischinger.\nDocument[3](Title: Franz Antel) Franz Antel( 28 June 1913 \u2013 11 August 2007) was a veteran Austrian filmmaker. Born in Vienna, Antel worked mainly as a film producer in the interwar years. After World War II, he began writing and directing films on a large scale. In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s these were mainly comedies( romantic, slapstick, and/ or musical) and\" K.u.k. films\" all of which, for Austrian and German TV stations alike, have been a staple of weekend afternoon programming ever since. In between there is quite a sober film about the Oberst( Colonel) Redl affair that shook the Austro- Hungarian Monarchy on the eve of World War I. Antel himself later commented on this period,\" I always wanted to provide good entertainment for the people at the cinema. After the screening, people should say: Well now, I am in a good mood, I will go out and have a glass of wine.\" ( German original:\" Ich wollte die Leute im Kino immer gut unterhalten. Die Besucher sollten nach der Filmvorf\u00fchrung sagen: So, jetzt bin ich gut aufgelegt, jetzt geh ich auf ein Viertel Wein.\") From the late 1960s, encouraged by the new opportunities in the film industry brought about by the sexual revolution, Antel gradually switched his main interest to soft porn and ribaldry. It was in particular his series of\" Frau Wirtinhostess\") films, directed under the pseudonym Fran\u00e7ois Legrand, with which he tried to win international recognition. Titles included\" The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan\"( 1967),\" Sexy Susan Sins Again\"( 1968),\" Wild, Willing& Sexy\"( 1969) and\" Do n't Tell Daddy\"( aka\" Naughty Nymphs\" in the U.S.A.)( 1972). Antel would recount an anecdote about himself describing how, in order to live up to his reputation as a womanizer, he used to carry a pair of high heels in his luggage which he then would occasionally place in the corridor in front of his hotel room \u2013 especially when he was travelling alone. Among the best known actors Antel had worked with from the 1940s to the 1970s were Hans Moser, Paul H\u00f6rbiger, Oskar Werner, Curd J\u00fcrgens, Tony Curtis, Herbert Fux, Heinrich Schweiger, Arthur Kennedy, Carroll Baker, Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Marisa Berenson, Britt Ekland, Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol. 1981 was a turning point in Antel's career when he adapted for the big screen a stage play by Ulrich Becher and Peter Preses. Set from the days of the Anschluss of 1938 until after the end of the war,\" Der Bockerer\" is about a Viennese butcher named Karl Bockerer( Karl Merkatz) whose common sense rather than intellect tells him to oppose the Nazis and who dares to show resistance just because he is never fully aware of the possible fateful consequences of his actions. While Bockerer and his wife survive the war unscathed, their son joins the SA but, after some internal intrigue, is sent to the front and killed. The film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. The film's strong anti-fascist message, the moving dialogue, and performances by the\" cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\" of Austrian actors and actresses( Ida Krottendorf, Alfred B\u00f6hm, Heinz Marecek, Hans Holt, Dolores Schmidinger and many more) made\" Der Bockerer\" an unusually successful film and gave new impetus to Antel's career.

Nefertari means 'beautiful companion' and Meritmut means 'Beloved of [the goddess] Mut'. She is one of the best known Egyptian queens, next to Cleopatra, Nefertiti, and Hatshepsut. She was highly educated and able to both read and write hieroglyphs, a very rare skill at the time. She used these skills in her diplomatic work, corresponding with other prominent royals of the time.

Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset.

A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace, he was a recipient of the \"Pour le M\u00e9riteThe Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 1 (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen. An early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in Adolf Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to morphine which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the Gestapo, which he ceded to Heinrich Himmler in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the Fall of France in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of \"Reichsmarschall\", which gave him seniority over all officers in Germany's armed forces. By 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the Second World War progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities and resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest. After the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out.\nDocument[2](Title: Wolfgang Herrndorf) Wolfgang Herrndorf( 12 June 1965 \u2013 26 August 2013) was a German author, painter, and illustrator.\nDocument[3](Title: Zhang Mengying) Zhang Mengying( born December 22, 1993 in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang) is a Chinese female ice hockey player.

Raised mostly in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel for a band he started, which his friend, Wyclef Jean, soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released the albums \"Blunted on Reality\" (1994), and the Grammy Award\u2013winning \"The Score\" (1996), which sold six million copies in the U.S. Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and her rendition of the hit \"Killing Me Softly\". Her tumultuous romantic relationship with Wyclef Jean led to the split of the band in 1997, after which she began to focus on solo projects. \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" (1998) remains Hill's only solo studio album. It received critical acclaim showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary voice within the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. \" Billboard\" 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. This included the singles \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" (also a number one), \"Ex-Factor\" (became her biggest solo hit in the UK), and \"Everything Is Everything\". At the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. During this time, she won several other awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines. Soon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, dissatisfied with the music industry and suffering from the pressures of fame.

A member of the House of Hohenzollern and daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor, Sophia received a liberal and anglophile education, under the supervision of her mother, Victoria, Princess Royal. In 1889, less than a year after the death of her father, she married her third cousin Constantine, heir apparent to the Greek throne. After a difficult period of adaptation in her new country, Sophia gave birth to six children and became involved in the assistance to the poor, following in the footsteps of her mother-in-law, Queen Olga. However, it was during the wars which Greece faced during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that Sophia showed the most social activity: she founded field hospitals, oversaw the training of Greek nurses, and healed wounded soldiers. However, Sophia was hardly rewarded for her actions, even after her grandmother Queen Victoria decorated her with the Royal Red Cross after the Thirty Days' War: the Greeks criticized her links with Germany. Her brother Emperor William II was indeed an ally of the Ottoman Empire and openly opposed the construction of the \"Megali Idea\", which could establish a Greek state that would encompass all ethnic Greek-inhabited areas. During World War I, the blood ties between Sophia and the German Emperor also aroused the suspicion of the Triple Entente, which criticized Constantine I for his neutrality in the conflict. After imposing a blockade of Greece and supporting the rebel government of Eleftherios Venizelos, causing the National Schism, France and its allies deposed Constantine I in June 1917. Sophia and her family then went into exile in Switzerland, while the second son of the royal couple replaced his father on the throne under the name of Alexander I. At the same time, Greece entered the war alongside the Triple Entente, which allowed it to grow considerably. After the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1919 and the untimely death of Alexander I the following year, the Venizelists abandoned power, allowing the royal family's return to Athens. The defeat of the Greek army against the Turkish troops of Mustafa Kemal, however, forced Constantine I to abdicate in favor of his eldest son George II in 1922. Sophia and her family then were forced to a new exile, and settled in Italy, where Constantine died one year later (1923).

No textual evidence of his reign is known, but some of his coins are known from the same period.\nDocument[2](Title: \u00c6thelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia) \u00c6thelwald (died 962) was ealdorman of East Anglia. He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of \u00c6thelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when \u00c6thelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of \u00c6lfthryth who married King Edgar after \u00c6thelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta regum anglorum\" has a late account of \u00c6thelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter \u00c6lfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent \u00c6thelwald to see \u00c6lfthryth, ordering him \"to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report. \" When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, \u00c6thelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay \u00c6thelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed \u00c6thelwald. He asked \u00c6lfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed \u00c6thelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the \u00c6thelwald murder story as a \"tissue of romance\" in his \"Historic essays\", but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book \"Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn\". \u00c6thelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother \u00c6thelwine succeeded to his offices.

This is now considered to be a lost film, as there are no available copies of it.\nDocument[2](Title: Thavamai Thavamirundhu) Thavamai Thavamirundhu is a 2005 Tamil language drama film written and directed by Cheran. The film stars himself and Padmapriya in lead roles with Rajkiran, Saranya, Mirchi Senthil, and Meenal portraying supporting roles. The music was composed by the duo Sabesh- Murali with cinematography by M. S. Prabhu and editing by B. Lenin. The film released on 2 December 2005. The film won the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. At 275 minutes, it is the longest Indian film by runtime. The feature was received well at the box office. The film is a penetrating and artistic depiction of familial bond, underscored by a set of life value messages. It explores the father- son relationship, and particularly charts the travails an Indian father goes through in raising his sons. The film received positive reviews from critics praising the film's plot, performances, and cinematography but criticized the film's lengthy running time. The movie briefly touches upon other relationships, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story, however, revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well- being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people. It also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well- being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family. It is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles \u2014 the father by Rajkiran and the mother by Saranya. Director Cheran has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children.

He was succeeded by his son, Augustus III of Poland. Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames \"the Strongthe Saxon Hercules\" and \"Iron-Hand\". He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end. He is also notable for fathering a very large number of children. In order to be elected King of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece from the Holy Roman Emperor. As Elector of Saxony, he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He established the Saxon capital of Dresden as a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw. His reigns brought Poland some troubled times. He led the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Great Northern War, which allowed the Russian Empire to strengthen its influence in Europe, especially within Poland. His main pursuit was bolstering royal power in the Commonwealth, characterized by broad decentralization in comparison with other European monarchies. He tried to accomplish this goal using foreign powers and thus destabilized the state.

He is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941\u20132011), who was North Korea's second leader from 1994 to 2011, and Ko Yong-hui (1952\u20132004). He is the grandson of Kim Il-sung, who was the founder and led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994. From late 2010, Kim Jong-un was viewed as heir apparent to the leadership of North Korea, and following the elder Kim's death, North Korean state television announced him as the \"Great Successor\". Kim holds the titles of Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (as First Secretary between 2012 and 2016), Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, commander-in-chief (as SAC chairman), and member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, the highest decision-making body in North Korea. Kim was promoted to the rank of Marshal of North Korea in the Korean People's Army on 18 July 2012, consolidating his position as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. North Korean state media often refers to him as Marshal Kim Jong-un, \"the Marshal\" or \"Dear Respected.\" Kim rules a dictatorship where elections are not free and fair, government critics are persecuted, media is controlled by the regime, internet access is limited by the regime, and there is no freedom of religion. His regime operates an extensive network of prisons and labor camps; the regime convicts people for political crimes and uses collective punishment whereby members of a family get punished for the crimes of one person. According to the United Nations, North Koreans live under \"systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\" where the regime \"seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens\u2019 lives and terrorizes them from within. \" The regime exerts extensive control over the North Korean economy, with substantial state-controlled economic enterprises and significant restrictions on North Koreans' ability to engage in foreign economic activity. \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Kim as the 36th most powerful person in the world in 2018 and the highest amongst Koreans. On 12 December 2013, Kim ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-thaek for \"treachery\". Kim is widely believed to have ordered the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Malaysia in February 2017.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Lin Biao) Lin Biao (December 5, 1907 \u2013 September 13, 1971) was a Marshal of the People's Republic of China who was pivotal in the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, especially in Northeast China. Lin was the general who commanded the decisive Liaoshen and Pingjin Campaigns, in which he co-led the Manchurian Field Army to victory and led the People's Liberation Army into Beijing. He crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, decisively defeated the Kuomintang and took control of the coastal provinces in Southeast China. He ranked third among the Ten Marshals. Zhu De and Peng Dehuai were considered senior to Lin, and Lin ranked directly ahead of He Long and Liu Bocheng. Lin abstained from taking an active role in politics after the civil war ceased in 1949. He led a section of the government's civil bureaucracy as one of the co-serving Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China from 1954 onwards, becoming First Vice Premier from 1964. Lin became more active in politics when named one of the co-serving Vice Chairmen of the Communist Party of China in 1958. He held the three responsibilities of Vice Premier, Vice Chairman and Minister of National Defense from 1959 onwards. Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for Mao Zedong's cult of personality in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the Cultural Revolution by being named Mao's designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China, from 1966 until his death. Lin died on September 13, 1971, when a Hawker Siddeley Trident he was aboard crashed in \u00d6nd\u00f6rkhaan in Mongolia. The exact events of this \"Lin Biao incident\" have been a source of speculation ever since. The Chinese government's official explanation is that Lin and his family attempted to flee following a botched coup against Mao. Others have argued that they fled out of fear they would be purged, as Lin's relationship with other Communist Party leaders had soured in the final few years of his life. Following Lin's death, he was officially condemned as a traitor by the Communist Party. Since the late 1970s Lin, and Mao's wife Jiang Qing (with her Gang of Four) have been labeled the two major \"counter-revolutionary forces\" of the Cultural Revolution, receiving official blame from the Chinese government.\nDocument[2](Title: Lin Liguo) Lin Liguo (1945 - September 13, 1971) was the son of the Chinese Communist military leader Lin Biao and the person in charge of Project 571 Outline, a plotted coup against Mao Zedong.

Mao Zedong's government claims, that in 1970, under his father Lin Biao's direction, Lin Liguo made a plan known as Project 571 to assassinate Mao Zedong in Shanghai, but Mao was alerted to it and left Shanghai one day ahead of schedule and changed return route back to Beijing. The Lin family, including Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo, attempted to flee after the coup failed.

It crashed in Mongolia on September 13, 1971, burning to death all on board.\". However, according to the historian J. D.

He was the leader of the House of Castro during the civil wars that followed the death of Sancho III of Castile and the succession of the infant Alfonso VIII. He was nicknamed el Castellano (\"the Castilian\") in Le\u00f3n and el Leon\u00e9s (\"the Leonese\") in Castile. Fernando was the eldest son of Rodrigo Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro and his wife, Eilo \u00c1lvarez. He led the Castro family in their dispute with the House of Lara over the custody and regency of the young Alfonso VIII after Sancho III's death in August 1158. Early in 1160 the Laras managed to exile him to the court of Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n. He returned to Castile in March with an army and defeated the Laras at the Battle of Lobregal, where his erstwhile father-in-law, Osorio Mart\u00ednez, was killed fighting alongside his enemies, and Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara was captured. Nonetheless, he was unable to reestablish himself in his homeland. Shortly after 1160, with a mixed force of Christians and Muslims, Fernando besieged the recently founded city of Ciudad Rodrigo. Ferdinand II, with the militias of Salamanca and Zamora, came to its relief. Fernando was soon reconciled to the king of Le\u00f3n, who appointed him governor first of Cu\u00e9llar, Due\u00f1as, Salamanca, Toro, Valladolid, and Zamora, and later of Asturias and Benavente. He served Ferdinand II as majordomo, the highest court official in power, on two occasions: between 15 August 1162 and 6 September 1164 and between 19 October 1165 and 15 May 1166. In 1162 Ferdinand II conquered Toledo from Castile and placed it in the hands of Fernando Rodr\u00edguez as governor. Toledo remained a Leonese possession until 1166. In 1164 Fernando returned to Castile a second time with an army and killed Manrique P\u00e9rez de Lara in the Battle of Huete (June/July). In 1168 he was appointed \"alcalde\" in the city of Le\u00f3n, and controlled the city's fortifications (\"tenente turris Legionisheld the towers of Le\u00f3n\") until 1182. In the early summer of 1169, the Portuguese freebooter Gerald the Fearless took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the \"alcazaba\", the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve Gerald. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of Le\u00f3n, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. Fernando Rodr\u00edguez, then majordomo, was one of the Leonese leaders on this expedition. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Fernando captured Gerald. After the m\u00eal\u00e9e the Leonese had control of the town and the \"alcazaba\", which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained C\u00e1ceres, but Trujillo, Mont\u00e1nchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfrag\u00fce he gave to Fernando Ruiz. Fernando thus established a semi-independent lordship between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, with his seat at Trujillo. In 1171 he was granted the \"infantaticum\" of Le\u00f3n. Between 1172 and 1175 Fernando held Mayorga and Melgar de Arriba from the Crown, both had been fiefs of Osorio Mart\u00ednez. He was for the remainder of his career a frequent attendee at both the Leonese and Castilian courts.

Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia( 1354 \u2013 1360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41- year- old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief.

He was the most prominent sculptor of Croatian modern sculpture and a leading personality of artistic life in Zagreb. He studied at the Pavle Bilini\u0107's Stone Workshop in Split and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he was formed under the influence of the Secession. He traveled throughout Europe and studied the works of ancient and Renaissance masters, especially Michelangelo, and French sculptors A. Rodin, A. Bourdelle and A. Maillola. He was the initiator of the national-romantic group Meduli\u0107 (he advocated the creation of art of national features inspired by the heroic folk songs). During the First World War, he lived in emigration. After the war, he returned to Croatia and began a long and fruitful period of sculpture and pedagogical work. In 1942 he emigrated to Italy, in 1943 to Switzerland and in 1947 to the United States. He was a professor of sculpture at the Syracuse University and from 1955 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Most of his early works of symbolic themes were formed in the spirit of the Secession, some of which, like the Well of Life, show impressionist restless surfaces created under the influence of Rodin's naturalism, and the second, reviving national myth, become stylized monumental plastics (Kosovo cycle, 1908-1910). Before the First World War, he left pathetic epic stylization, expressing increasingly emotional states, as evidenced by the wooden reliefs of biblical themes made in a combination of Archaic, Gothic, Secessionist and Expressionist styles. During the 1920s and 1930s, the classical component prevailed in his works. In this period, he created a number of public monuments of strong plastic expression, pronounced and legible shapes (Grgur Ninski and Marko Maruli\u0107 in Split, Andrija Meduli\u0107, Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107-Mio\u0161i\u0107 and Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Zagreb, \"The Bowman\" and \"The Spearman\" in Chicago). Portraits take a special place in his opus. Me\u0161trovi\u0107 achieved works of strong plastic value in the construction-sculptural monuments and projects, mostly with central layout (the Mausoleum of the Ra\u010di\u0107 family in Cavtat, the Mausoleum of the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 family in Otavice, the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion in Zagreb, Monument to the Unknown Hero in Belgrade). He also designed a memorial church of King Zvonimir in Biskupija near Knin inspired by old Croatian churches, a representative family palace, today the Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Gallery, and reconstructed renaissance fortified mansion Crikvine-Ka\u0161tilac in Split.\nDocument[2](Title: Mate Me\u0161trovi\u0107) Mate Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (born 13 September 1930, Zagreb, Sava Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia), also known as Matthew Mestrovic (or Matthew Me\u0161trovi\u0107), is an American journalist and academic, Croatian lobbyist, politician and ambassador.

He was a son of Muryeong of Baekje and is best known for making Buddhism the state religion, moving the national capital to Sabi (present-day Buyeo County), and reclaiming the center of the Korean Peninsula. His demise eventually came at the hands of an ally who betrayed him. The name Seong translates as 'The Holy.'\nDocument[2](Title: Hye of Baekje) King Hye of Baekje (died 599) (r. 598\u2013599) was the 28th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The second son of the 26th king Seong, he assumed the throne after the death of his older brother and 27th king Wideok, but reigned only briefly before his own death. The Samguk Yusa describes him as the son of Wideok, but this is considered an error. His reign saw major inroads from the neighbouring Silla and Goguryeo kingdoms, with Silla occupying the present-day Seoul area and trading directly with China. Baekje's commercial positions along the Yellow Sea coast were now dominated by Goguryeo, trading outposts in China were lost to the Sui Dynasty's unification, and Japan's political centralization outgrew Baekje's influence as well. The decline of external commerce and influence led to infighting among the nobility. He was succeeded by his son Beop.\nDocument[3](Title: Jeonji of Baekje) Jeonji of Baekje (died 420) (r. 405\u2013420) was the eighteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. As the eldest son, he was confirmed as successor to King Asin, in 394. His queen was Lady Palsu of the Hae clan. Jeonji spent much of his youth in the Wa kingdom of Yamato Japan as hostage, going there in 397. Upon his father\u2019s death, he returned home to find that his uncle Seollye had murdered Hunhae, Asin's other brother, and usurped the throne. Hae Chung, an inhabitant of Hanseong, warned him not to enter the capital. Shortly thereafter, Seollye was killed and Jeonji made king. Presumably out of gratitude for this, Jeonji made several members of the Hae clan ministers, as well as marrying Lady Palso of the Hae clan. This put an end to the royal family\u2019s close ties to the Jin clan. The traditional dates of Jeonji's rule are based on the \"Samguk Sagi\". On the basis of more contemporaneous Chinese records, Best (1979) has suggested that the years 405\u2013414 are more plausible. According to the \"Samguk Sagi\", in 406 Baekje sent a tribute mission to the Chinese court of Eastern Jin. It is the first mention of such a mission in more than twenty years, and may indicate that the country had become more secure against Goguryeo. It would have been typical to send such an embassy to inform the Chinese court that a new king had taken power. However, this visit is not confirmed by Chinese sources. In 416 Jin sent envoys to grant the title \" General Stabilizing the East\" to Jeonji(Yeo Yeong).\n\nQuestion: Who is Hye Of Baekje's paternal grandfather?": [

He was the second son of William I of J\u00fclich and Joanna of Hainaut. William was co-ruler from 1343. He quarreled greatly with his father and imprisoned him from 1349-1351. He tried for many years in Holland-Zeeland to enforce claims against the House of Wittelsbach but failed. When his father died in 1361, William became the second Duke of J\u00fclich, his elder brother Gerhard having predeceased their father. He led the traditional feuds of the House of J\u00fclich and lost Kaiserswerth and Z\u00fclpich, among others. William intervened in favor of Edward in the catastrophic war of succession between his brothers-in-law Reinald and Edward for control of the Duchy of Guelders. He took part in the 1371 Battle of Baesweiler (in which Edward was mortally wounded) and captured Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg. His brother-in-law Reinald died later in 1371 and as neither Reinald nor Edward left heirs, another fight for the succession of Guelders arose between William and his wife Maria (sister to Reinald and Edward) and Maria's sister Mathilde, wife of John II, Count of Blois.

Reinald IV became the second Duke of Guelders and J\u00fclich upon his brother William's death in 1402 without heirs. Reinald, in conjunction with the Wittelsbach Counts of Holland, Hainaut and Zeeland, tried in vain to slow the emergence of Burgundy in the Netherlands area and in 1406 was unable to enforce old claims against Burgundy to Brabant- Limburg. He allied himself with Rupert, King of Germany, supporting his coronation in Aachen and remained closely connected with the House of Orl\u00e9ans. In 1407, Reinald supported his brother- in- law, John of Arkel, against the Dutch and in 1409 received the city of Gorinchem from John. This started a new feud with Holland which ended in 1412 when Reinald ceded Gorinchem for a large sum of money. He also conceded the city of Emmerich as a result of an earlier promise to the Duke of Cleves.

George is the most recent British monarch born outside Great Britain: he was born and brought up in northern Germany. The Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707 positioned his grandmother, Sophia of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants to inherit the British throne. After the deaths of Sophia and Anne, Queen of Great Britain, in 1714, his father, the Elector of Hanover, became George I of Great Britain. In the first years of his father's reign as king, George was associated with opposition politicians, until they rejoined the governing party in 1720. As king from 1727, George exercised little control over British domestic policy, which was largely controlled by the Parliament of Great Britain. As elector, he spent twelve summers in Hanover, where he had more direct control over government policy. He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son, Frederick, who supported the parliamentary opposition. During the War of the Austrian Succession, George participated at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle. In 1745 supporters of the Catholic claimant to the British throne, James Francis Edward Stuart (\"The Old Pretender\"), led by James's son Charles Edward Stuart (\"The Young Pretender\" or \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\"), attempted and failed to depose George in the last of the Jacobite rebellions. Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751, nine years before his father, so George II was ultimately succeeded by his grandson, George III. For two centuries after George II's death, history tended to view him with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short temper, and boorishness. Since then, reassessment of his legacy has led scholars to conclude that he exercised more influence in foreign policy and military appointments than previously thought.\nDocument[2](Title: Princess Amelia of Great Britain) Princess Amelia of Great Britain ( Amelia Sophia Eleanor; 10 June 1711( New Style) \u2013 31 October 1786) was the second daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Queen Caroline.\nDocument[3](Title: Princess Amelia of Great Britain) Princess Amelia of Great Britain (Amelia Sophia Eleanor; 10 June 1711 (New Style) \u2013 31 October 1786) was the second daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Queen Caroline.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Princess Amelia Of Great Britain born?": [

In 1972 Carle won the Canadian Film Award for best Director for his \"The True Nature of Bernadette\". Carle was born in Maniwaki, Quebec. His film \"50 ans\", celebrating the \"50 years\" of the National Film Board of Canada, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: John, King of England) John (24 December 1166 \u2013 19 October 1216) was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216. He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of \", a document sometimes considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom. John was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. He became Henry's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173\u201374 by his brothers Henry the Young King, Richard, and Geoffrey against the King. John was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. The war between Henry II and his eldest sons ended with the deaths of Henry the Young King and Geoffrey. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard, whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199. He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200. When war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton, and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. He spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. His judicial reforms had a lasting effect on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute he finally settled in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the \" peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis VIII of France. It soon descended into a stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year. Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the current historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", such as pettiness, spitefulness, and cruelty. These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends.\nDocument[2](Title: Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester) Eleanor of England (also called Eleanor Plantagenet and Eleanor of Leicester) (1215 \u2013 13 April 1275) was the youngest child of John, King of England and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame.\nDocument[3](Title: Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester) Eleanor of England( also called Eleanor Plantagenet and Eleanor of Leicester)( 1215 \u2013 13 April 1275) was the youngest child of John, King of England and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame.\n\nQuestion: Who is Eleanor Of England, Countess Of Leicester's paternal grandmother?": [

On 11 December 1523 in Kassel, she married Landgrave Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. The marriage was arranged to forge an alliance between Hesse and Saxony and was unhappy; Philip claimed to be disgusted by her and only shared her bed by duty. They had ten children. Whilst married to Christine, Philip practised bigamy and had another nine children with his other (morganatic) wife, Margarethe von der Saale; in 1540, Christine gave her consent to her husband's bigamy with his lover because of her view upon him as her sovereign.

It is a direct continuation of\" Paris By Night 22: 40 N\u0103m \u00c2m Nh\u1ea1c Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\" and\" Paris By Night 28: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 2- D\u00f2ng Nh\u1ea1c N\u1ed1i Ti\u1ebfp\", that was released several years earlier. This program was codenamed,\" In Houston 2\"( which was thought to be a successor to\" Paris By Night 36: In Houston\", before the title was announced). Before the main subject title was announced, the program was then codenamed to\" In Houston 2: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 3\"( the third Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series). The\" three\" was scrapped off the title and the subject was simply,\" Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\". Vietnamese composer, Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, is one of the Vietnamese community's most famous composers today; composing famous songs before and even after the Vietnam War, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Since the early years of\" Paris By Night\", Th\u00fay Nga has been making single- composer videos dedicated to just a single composer. Starting in Paris By Night 64: \u00d0\u00eam V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Th\u00ednh Ph\u00f2ng however, Thuy Nga introduced the three- composer format. That trend continued in\" Paris By Night 66: Ng\u01b0\u1eddi T\u00ecnh v\u00e0 Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ngParis By Night 70: Thu CaParis By Night 74: Hoa B\u01b0\u1edbm Ng\u00e0y X\u01b0a Paris By Night 78: \u00d0\u01b0\u1eddng X\u01b0a\", and finally in\" Paris By Night 83: Nh\u1eefng Kh\u00fac H\u00e1t \u00c2n T\u00ecnh\". However, composer Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is an exception. After being beloved by many, and his songs are in a timeless label, Th\u00fay Nga thought that he should deserve the entire program just dedicated to him and his songs, in a program that was meant for three composers. \" Paris By Night 88\" is Th\u00fay Nga's third live- performance show, after\" Paris By Night 86\" and\" Paris By Night 87\", which was the PBN Talent Show. This is a trend that Th\u00fay Nga may be beginning to adapt, after years of having singers lip- sync on stage, a practice that is common and accepted in the Vietnamese music community. \" Paris By Night 88\" used famous songs that was originally performed in\" Paris By Night 28\" and\" Paris By Night 22\", which were part of the Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series. This is also director Alan Carter's first direction of\" Paris By Night\", in place of its regular director, Michael Watt after many years.

He was the son of Frederick Dent Grant, and the grandson of General of the Army and U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant.\nDocument[3](Title: Ulysses S. Grant) Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant; April 27, 1822 \u2013 July 23, 1885) was an American soldier and politician who served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877. Before his presidency, Grant led the Union Army in winning the American Civil War. As president, Grant worked with the Radical Republicans in the Reconstruction of the Union while having to deal with corruption in his administration. Raised in Ohio, young Grant possessed an exceptional ability with horses, which served him well through his military career. He was admitted to West Point and graduated from the U.S. military academy in 1843. Grant served with distinction in the Mexican\u2013American War. In 1848, he married Julia Dent, and together they had four children. Grant abruptly resigned his army commission in 1854 and returned to his family, but lived in poverty for seven years. During the Civil War, he joined the Union Army in 1861, and led the Vicksburg campaign, which gained control of the Mississippi River in 1863. After Grant's victory at Chattanooga, President Abraham Lincoln promoted Grant to Lieutenant General. For thirteen months, Grant fought Robert E. Lee during the high casualty Overland Campaign and at Petersburg. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox. A week later, Lincoln was assassinated, and was succeeded by President Andrew Johnson, who promoted Grant to General of the Army in 1866. Later Grant openly broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies; Grant used the reconstruction acts, which had been passed over Johnson's veto, to enforce civil rights for African freedmen. A war hero but a reluctant politician , Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party and was elected president in 1868. As president, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, created the Department of Justice, and prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan. He appointed African-Americans and Jewish-Americans to prominent federal offices. In 1871, he created the first Civil Service Commission. The Liberal Republicans and Democrats united behind Grant's opponent in the presidential election of 1872, but Grant was handily re-elected. Grant's Native American policy had both successes and failures. In foreign affairs, the Grant administration peacefully resolved the \"Alabama\" claims against Great Britain, but the Senate rejected Grant's prized Caribbean Dominican Republic annexation. Corruption in the executive branch became notorious: several of Grant's cabinet members and other appointees were fired or had to resign. The Panic of 1873 plunged the nation into a severe economic depression, that allowed the Democrats win the House majority. In the intensely disputed Presidential election of 1876, Grant facilitated the approval by Congress of a peaceful compromise. In his retirement, Grant was the first president to circumnavigate the world on his tour meeting with many foreign leaders. In 1880, Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for a third term. In the final year of his life, facing severe financial reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which proved to be a major critical and financial success. At the time of his death, he was memorialized as a symbol of national unity. Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied. Historians have recognized Grant's military genius, and his modern strategies of warfare are featured in military history textbooks. 20th century historical rankings of presidents of the United States have ranked Grant among the worst presidents because of corruption charges against some of his top appointees or White House military aides. 21st century historians have emphasized Grant's presidential accomplishments including the Alabama Claims settlement, protection of Blacks and Indians, and the first Civil Service Commission. Grant was an embattled president who faced a difficult challenge getting the entire nation to accept Reconstruction efforts.\n\nQuestion: Where did Ulysses S. Grant Jr.'s father graduate from?": [

Born in New York City, Bushkin began his career by playing trumpet and piano with New York City dance bands, including Frank LaMare's Band at the Roseland Ballroom in Brooklyn. He joined Bunny Berigan's band in 1935, played with Eddie Condon from 1936\u201337, and with Max Kaminsky and Joe Marsala, before rejoining Berigan in 1938. He then left to join Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band in 1939. From the late 1930s through to the late 1940s he also worked with Tommy Dorsey & Eddie Condon on records, radio and television. He worked with Dorsey for Bing Crosby in 1940 on The Road To Morocco soundtrack and several commercial sessions. Wartime United States army air corp turned him back into a trumpeter; he also recorded with Lester Young on piano and directed music for Moss Hart\u2019s morale-booster Winged Victory on Broadway for six months before serving in the South Pacific. After his service in World War II he worked with Louis Armstrong, Bud Freeman and Benny Goodman. Bushkin performed with Louis Armstrong and his All Stars with Velma Middleton singing vocals for the famed ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. The concert was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 7, 1953. Also featured that day were Roy Brown and his Orchestra, Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, Earl Bostic, Nat \"King\" Cole, and Shorty Rogers and his Orchestra. He married Francice Netcher, elder sister of socialite Mollie Wilmot. The couple had four children \u2013 Nina, Maria, Terasa, and Christina. They lived in Santa Barbara, California, on a ranch. His best-known composition might be \"Oh! Look at Me Now\", with John DeVries, written when he worked in Tommy Dorsey's band. That song would become Frank Sinatra's second hit and one of his most enduring songs right after \"Polkadots & Moonbeams.\" One of Bushkin's television appearances was on a thirty-minute Judy Garland musical special produced for the General Electric Theater which aired on April 8, 1956 on the CBS Television Network. According to Coyne Steven Sanders, author of the book \"Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show\", Bushkin was a last-minute replacement for the classic pianist Leonard Pennario. On that program, he accompanied Garland on piano as she sang the songs Last Night When We Were Young and Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries. (Sanders, Coyne Steven, \"Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show\" pgs. 20-21 - Zebra Books - Kensington Publishing Company). In his 60s, Bushkin's semi-retirement was ended by an offer from Bing Crosby for them to tour together in 1976 and 1977; Bushkin also appeared on Crosby's 1975 Christmas TV special with Fred Astaire. He also performed in a concert series at New York's St. Regis hotel in 1984 that celebrated his 50 years in show business.

The song was originally recorded by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters on June 30, 1944 and reached number one on the top 100 U.S. songs of 1944. The song was introduced on Frank Sinatra's CBS radio show and became popular due to its patriotic lyrics, swinging rhythm, and its orchestral arrangement. It would later appear as war propaganda in the Warner Bros. short film, \"Road to Victory\", where it was performed by Sinatra himself. The Crosby / Andrews Sisters version was later used on the soundtrack of the 1977 film \"Tracks\".

His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook. Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, \"Marie from Sunny Italy\", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" in 1911. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever. \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also \"flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania. \" Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to \"reach the heart of the average American,\" whom he saw as the \"real soul of the country.\" In doing so, said Walter Cronkite, at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he \"helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives.\" He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including \"Alexander's Ragtime BandEaster ParadePuttin' on the RitzCheek to CheekWhite ChristmasHappy HolidayAnything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". His Broadway musical and 1943 film \"This is the Army\", with Ronald Reagan, had Kate Smith singing Berlin's \"God Bless America\" which was first performed in 1938. Berlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including The Andrews Sisters, Perry Como, Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Cher, Diana Ross, Bing Crosby, Sarah Vaughan, Ruth Etting, Fanny Brice, Marilyn Miller, Rudy Vall\u00e9e, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day, Jerry Garcia, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Buble, Lady Gaga, and Christina Aguilera. Berlin died in 1989 at the age of 101. Composer Douglas Moore sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, as a \"great American minstrel\"\u2014someone who has \"caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.\" Composer George Gershwin called him \"the greatest songwriter that has ever lived\", and composer Jerome Kern concluded that \"Irving Berlin has no \"place\" in American music\u2014he \"is\" American music.\"\n\nQuestion: When was the composer of song Hot Time In The Town Of Berlin born?": [

The film includes two famous Cagney dialogues, one of which features Cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in Yiddish, and the other when Cagney is speaking to his brother's killer through a locked closet, Come out and take it, you dirty yellow- bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door! The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough- guy- dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film. In a lengthy and memorable sequence, the scene culminates with Raft and his partner winning the dance contest against Cagney and Young, after which Cagney slugs Raft and knocks him down. As in\" The Public Enemy\"( 1931), several scenes in\" Taxi!\" involved the use of live machine gun bullets. After a few of the bullets narrowly missed Cagney's head, he outlawed the practice in his future films.

A trained dentist, born in Buenos Aires , his real passion was always the cinema. He pioneered Argentine cultural movement known as cineclub and financed the first movie theater to show \"art movies\". He also founded Argentina's first film club in 1929. After participating as scriptwriter and assistant director of 1944's \"Se abre el abismo\", he filmed his first movie, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"The Player\". He also worked on adaptations of Alexandre Dumas' \" The Count of Monte Cristo\" and Ernesto Sabato's \"The Tunnel\". During the 1950s, Klimovsky settled in Spain, where he became a full-time \"professional\" director. He directed many spaghetti westerns and \"exploitation films\", filming in Mexico, Italy, Spain and Egypt. Horror film fans best remember him for his contributions to Spain's horror film genre, beginning with \"La Noche de WalpurgisWalpurgis Night\"), the film that is said to have started the Spanish horror film boom of the 1970s. Klimovsky directed famed Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy in no less than 9 films in the 1970s, while also directing other classic horror films such as \"The Strange Love of the VampiresThe Dracula Saga\" and \"The Vampires' Night Orgy\". Naschy complimented Klimovsky's workmanlike attitude and abundant energy, but he always felt that Klimovsky rushed through many of their projects together, never allowing for sufficient retakes. Le\u00f3n Klimovsky always dreamt of doing great mainstream movies but ended up doing commercial exploitation films, but he had no remorse, as cinema was a vocational mandate for him. He retired from directing in 1979, at age 73. In 1995, at age 89, he won the \"Honor Award\" from the Spanish Film Directors Association. He died the following year in Madrid from a heart attack. He was the brother of noted Argentinian mathematician and philosopher Gregorio Klimovsky.\n\nQuestion: Where did the director of film Bridge Over The Elbe die?": [

She considered herself primarily a writer, and was the first woman in Poland to support herself from writing and teaching, as well as one of Poland's first writers of children's literature. She made her debut in 1819 with a moralizing treatise \"A Souvenir After a Good Mother\". In 1820s, she edited a popular magazine for children and published several children books, that have won a wide audience over several generations. She published a number of novels, including \"The Letters of El\u017cbieta Rzeczycka to her friend Urszula\" (1824) and \"The Diary of Countess Francoise Krasinska\" (1825), the latter being Hoffmanowa's best known work, translated into several languages, and described as one of the first Polish psychological novels. Hoffmanowa raised the postulate of economic self-empowerment of women. She believed that the first step for women to achieve independence should be getting an education and preparing for paid work. However, she held conservative views on the role of women, and referred to national and Catholic values. In 1826, her candidacy for membership in the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning was submitted, but she was not accepted as a woman. She remained unmarried until the age of thirty, long by the standards of her time for a woman, and only in 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman. Until then she used her maiden name. Though writing was her main and most preferred activity, she also worked as a teacher, at the time called the \"inspector\" and \"visitator\" of female schools, and lecturer in moral science at the Governess' Institute in Warsaw (1826\u20131831). She educated a number of young women, some of whom in later years became writers and teachers themselves. Hoffmanowa was mentioned with respect and appreciation by some of her students. In turn, her pupil Narcyza \u017bmichowska criticized Hoffmanowa's conservatism. During the Poland's November Uprising against the Russian Empire, Hoffmanowa was a co-creator and chairman of the Union of Patriotic Charity of the Varsovians and carried the help to the wounded soldiers. After the fall of the uprising in 1831, she and her husband fled to Paris, where their house became the meeting place of the Polish political refugees.

She was the only surviving child of Louis X of France, King of France and Navarre, and Margaret of Burgundy. Joan's paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but Louis X declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316. However, the French lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and elected Louis X's brother, Philip V, king. The Navarrese noblemen also paid homage to Philip. Joan's maternal grandmother, Agnes of France, Duchess of Burgundy, and uncle, Odo IV of Burgundy, made attempts to secure the counties of Champagne and Brie (which had been the patrimony of Louis X's mother, Joan I of Navarre) to Joan, but the French royal troops defeated her supporters. After Philip V married his daughter to Odo and granted him two counties as her dowry, Odo renounced Joan's claim to Champagne and Brie in exchange for a compensation in March 1318.

During his 31-year reign, which has been called the \"greatest explosion of human energy ever seen in Burma\", Bayinnaung assembled what was probably the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia, which included much of modern-day Burma, the Chinese Shan states, Lan Na, Lan Xang, Manipur and Siam. Although he is best remembered for his empire building, Bayinnaung's greatest legacy was his integration of the Shan states into the Irrawaddy-valley-based kingdoms. After the conquest of the Shan states in 1557\u20131563, the king put in an administrative system that reduced the power of hereditary Shan \"saophas\", and brought Shan customs in line with low-land norms. It eliminated the threat of Shan raids into Upper Burma, an overhanging concern to Upper Burma since the late 13th century. His Shan policy was followed by Burmese kings right up to the final fall of the kingdom to the British in 1885. Bayinnaung could not replicate this administrative policy everywhere in his far flung empire, however. His empire was a loose collection of former sovereign kingdoms, whose kings were loyal to \"him\" as the \"Cakkavatti\" (Universal Ruler), not the Kingdom of Toungoo. Indeed, Ava and Siam revolted just over two years after his death. By 1599, all the vassal states had revolted, and the Toungoo Empire completely collapsed. Bayinnaung is considered one of the three greatest kings of Burma, along with Anawrahta and Alaungpaya. Some of the most prominent places in modern Myanmar are named after him. He is also well known in Thailand as the \"Phra Chao Chana Sip Thit\" (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e34\u0e28, \"Victor of the Ten Directions\").\nDocument[2](Title: Nawrahta Minsaw) Nawrahta Minsaw (formally, Anawrahta Minsaw; also known as Nawrahta Saw and Tharrawaddy Min; 1551/52\u20131607/08) was king of Lan Na from 1579 to 1607/08, and the first Burmese-born vassal king of Lan Na. He was also an accomplished poet. Appointed to the Lan Na throne by his father King Bayinnaung of Burma, Nawrahta dutifully contributed to his half-brother King Nanda's debilitating war effort against Siam (1584\u201395). He declared independence in 1597 after having defeated a 1595\u201396 invasion by Lan Xang on his own. From 1599 onward, he was forced to deal with a Lan Xang backed rebellion in Nan, and a Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai and Chiang Saen. He defeated the Chiang Rai rebellion in 1601\u201302 but was eventually forced to submit to Siam soon after. He defeated an invasion by Lan Xang in 1602\u201303, regaining Nan in the process.

She married Henry in 1485 after his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, which marked the end of the Wars of the Roses. Together, Elizabeth and Henry had seven, possibly eight, children. After the death of her father, King Edward IV, Elizabeth's brothers the \"Princes in the Tower\" disappeared, their fate uncertain. Although the 1484 act of Parliament \"Titulus Regius\" declared the marriage of her parents, Edward and Elizabeth Woodville, invalid, she and her sisters were subsequently welcomed back to court by Edward's brother, King Richard III. As a Yorkist princess, the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster, but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry Elizabeth before he arrived in England. This may well have contributed to the hemorrhaging of Yorkist support for Richard. Although Elizabeth seems to have played little part in politics, her marriage appears to have been a successful one. Her eldest son Arthur, Prince of Wales, died at age 15 in 1502, and three other children died young.

Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent country and is today revered in Scotland as a national hero. His paternal fourth great-grandfather was King David I. Robert's grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the \"Great Cause\". As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the Scottish throne and took part in William Wallace's revolt against Edward I of England. Appointed in 1298 as a Guardian of Scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne, John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, Robert later resigned in 1300 due to his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of John Balliol to the Scottish throne. After submitting to Edward I in 1302 and returning to \"the king's peace\", Robert inherited his family's claim to the Scottish throne upon his father's death. In February 1306, Bruce, having wounded Comyn, rushed from the church where they had met and encountered his attendants outside. He told them what had happened and said, \"I must be off, for I doubt I have slain the Red Comyn. Doubt?\" , Roger de Kirkpatrick of Closeburn answered. \"I mak sikker,I'll make sure,\" or \"I make sure\"). Kirkpatrick then rushed into the church and killed Comyn. For this, Bruce was then excommunicated by the Pope (although he received absolution from Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow). Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne, and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in battle, forcing him to flee into hiding before re-emerging in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Bruce defeated his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands, and in 1309 held his first parliament. A series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland, and at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Robert defeated a much larger English army under Edward II of England, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish kingdom. The battle marked a significant turning point, with Robert's armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern England, while also extending his war against the English to Ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the Irish to rise against Edward II's rule. Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish nobility submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Robert as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Robert I as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland. Robert died in June 1329.

When I saw other little girls going to First Communion, I said to myself: how shall I ever reach my First Communion? Later: how shall I ever get to the point of entering Carmel? And still later: reach my Clothing, make my Profession? And now I say the same of dying. The devil is about me. I feel him near me. He torments me and holds me with a grip of iron to deprive me of all consolation, trying by increasing my sufferings to make me despair. Oh, how necessary it is to pray for the dying.

In foreign conflicts, Pepin increased the power of the Franks by his subjugation of the Alemanni, the Frisians, and the Franconians. He also began the process of evangelisation in Germany.

The band never had much success in their home country, but they became popular in Finland in the 1960s.\nDocument[2](Title: Renegades (band)) Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side- project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four- track EP was then recorded. Soon later, Renegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they would play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with the same members. If Feeder songs released before the\" Renegades\" album were to be played, the band would announce that they're covering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced\" Tangerine\" as\" A cover of a song from a band we know\". The idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who returned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the' Renegades' project. The tracks originally intended for the side- project were soon used for the seventh Feeder album\" Renegades\". The side- project was as a result used as a method to promote the\" Renegades\" album at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. On the first of January 2010, a four- day countdown timer was added to the band's official website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title- track for the EP,\" Renegades\" was released as a free download as well as a package containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-ticket for one of the six shows available. The\" Renegades EP\" was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed- up by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010 appearance, which was their last UK show using this name and also their tour of Japan in July of the same year.

His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist. Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", and the international top 10 singles \"Give Peace a ChanceInstant Karma!Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". Lennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. After moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration \"Double Fantasy\". He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release. By 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide.

His parents were Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane-Fox (1827\u20131900) and Alice Margaret (1828\u20131910, n\u00e9e Stanley). On the death of his father's cousin Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers, the family took the name \"Fox Pitt-Rivers\" on May 25, 1880. In 1878, Fox-Pitt was granted a patent on a light bulb with a platinum-iridium filament. The patent also describes a system for power distribution using incandescent lamps in parallel. On 12 December 1879, Charles Francis Brush founded the Anglo-American Electric Light Company Ltd in the UK, and in the same year acquired the patent rights to produce the Lane-Fox incandescent lamp. On 24 March 1880, he founded a new company, Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation, which took over the previous one. About 1880, Fox-Pitt is said to have successfully experimented with charred plant fibres as the filament material. That was about the same time as the development of the light bulb with carbon filament by Edison in the United States. By 1883, Fox-Pitt had obtained further patents. Fox-Pitt wrote books on the philosophy of science, education, and social problems. He was temporarily Vice-President of the Moral Education League and organized the International Moral Education Congress. He was also one of the first active members of the Society for Psychical Research. In 1891, he repurchased the patent rights of the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation and built himself a small lamp factory. In 1898, he participated in a railway concession in Ecuador. In 1899, he married Lady Edith Gertrude Douglas (1874\u20131963), the daughter of John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry.\nDocument[2](Title: George Washington Bright) George Washington Bright( December 27, 1874 \u2013 March 20, 1949) was an American sailor serving in the United States Navy during the Spanish \u2013 American War who received the Medal of Honor for his actions.\nDocument[3](Title: Charles Taze Russell) Charles Taze Russell( February 16, 1852 \u2013 October 31, 1916), or Pastor Russell, was an American Christian restorationist minister from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and founder of what is now known as the Bible Student movement. After his death, Jehovah's Witnesses and numerous independent Bible Student groups developed from this base. In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious journal,\" Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\". In 1881 he co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society with William Henry Conley as president; in 1884 the corporation was officially registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 printed pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six- volume Bible study series originally titled\" Millennial Dawn\", later renamed\" Studies in the Scriptures\", nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime. ( A seventh volume was commissioned by his successor as society president, Joseph Rutherford, and published in 1917.) The Watch Tower Society ceased publication of Russell's writings in 1927, though his books are still published by several independent groups. After Russell's death, a crisis arose surrounding Rutherford's leadership of the society, culminating in a movement- wide schism. As many as three- quarters of the approximately 50,000 Bible Students who had been associating in 1917 had left by 1931. This shift resulted in the formation of several groups that retained variations on the name\" Bible Students\". Those who maintained fellowship with the Watch Tower Society adopted the name\" Jehovah's witnesses\" in 1931, while those who severed ties with the Society formed their own groups including the Pastoral Bible Institute in 1918, the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement in 1919, and the Dawn Bible Students Association in 1929.\n\nQuestion: Who died earlier, Charles Taze Russell or George Washington Bright?": [

The brothers took over operation of the ironworks about 1765 and expanded it successfully. Curtis operated the Cornwall Furnace that produced pig iron, and Peter, who had more ironmaking experience, ran the nearby Hopewell Forges on Hammer Creek that produced more valuable bar iron. In 1773, Curtis paid taxes on at the furnace location and Peter paid taxes on at the forges location, reflecting both the size of the operation and their proportional ownership. They operated the business through and after the Revolution, becoming quite prosperous until they died, Peter in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Most of the Cornwall ironworks fell out of family hands during the period 1783 - 1802, to Robert Coleman who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire. But a portion, including rights to access the ore, remained with Peter Jr.'s heirs, who added to it to become major Pennsylvania producers of iron in the mid-19th century, operating out of Mount Hope Estate.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Jehu Grubb's father?": [

The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough- guy- dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film.

In the same year, his film \"Constellation of Riflemen\" won honours in the 17th All State Festival in Leningrad and the Latvian Komsomol prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the Soviet Union. Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie \" 'Is It Easy to Be Young?\". The film with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks talked to youngsters later convicted for criminal actions. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled \"Hello, do you hear us?\". It showed civil unrest in Uzbekistan, survivors of the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, striking workers in Yaroslavl and former residents returning to Chernobyl. The first film in the series, \"Red Hot\", was awarded the Prix Italia and the Peabody Award. Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of national identity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. His \"Homeland\" was an account of folk festivals in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the attempted coup by Soviet forces in Riga. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend Andris Slapi\u0146\u0161 was killed and Gvido Zvaigzne, another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries.

Following the release of Thicker Than Water, Kelly Slater asked Jack Johnson to accompany Kelly for a trip to Indonesia. With the cast living on a retired Japanese coastguard cutter,\" Neptune 1\", Jack films Kelly and several other surfers including Rob Machado and Shane Dorian as they surfed flawless waves off the coast of Sumatra in the Mentawais of Indonesia. The film captures Kelly Slater during a major change of his life following his first retirement from the ASP circuit. Kelly had fallen into the trap of endless trade shows, store openings, and poster signings that became his life during his first retirement. By escaping both the trade shows and his former life of ASP competitions, Kelly sought to gain new levels in his spirit as he and his friends pulled into the keyhole at Hollow Trees in September, 1999.

Jack wrote several songs along the way including\" F- Stop Blues\".

Until his father's death, he used the title of Marquis of Torres Novas, and also succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Aveiro in 1571. He was a close adviser to King Sebastian I of Portugal and he escorted him, both to the Guadalupe interview (where Sebastian met his uncle, King Philip II of Spain) and to the Portuguese campaign to Morocco. George was killed in the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir, together with the King, in 1578.

According to Hussein, he was a 40th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad as he belonged to the Hashemite family which has ruled Jordan since 1921. Hussein was born in Amman as the eldest child of Talal bin Abdullah and Zein Al-Sharaf. Hussein began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. After Talal became King of Jordan in 1951, Hussein was named heir apparent. The Parliament forced Talal to abdicate a year later due to his illness, and a regency council was appointed until Hussein came of age. He was enthroned at the age of 17 on 2 May 1953. Hussein was married four separate times and fathered eleven children: Princess Alia from Dina bint Abdul-Hamid; Abdullah II, Prince Faisal, Princess Aisha, and Princess Zein from Antoinette Gardiner; Princess Haya and Prince Ali from Alia Touqan; Prince Hamzah, Prince Hashim, Princess Iman, and Princess Raiyah from Lisa Halaby. Hussein, a constitutional monarch, started his rule with what was termed a \"liberal experiment,\" allowing, in 1956, the formation of the only democratically elected government in Jordan's history. A few months into the experiment, he forced that government to resign, declaring martial law and banning political parties. Jordan fought three wars with Israel under Hussein, including the 1967 Six-Day War, which ended in Jordan's loss of the West Bank. In 1970 Hussein expelled Palestinian fighters (fedayeen) from Jordan after they had threatened the country's security in what became known as Black September. The King renounced Jordan's ties to the West Bank in 1988 after the Palestine Liberation Organization was recognized internationally as the sole representative of the Palestinians. He lifted martial law and reintroduced elections in 1989 when riots over price hikes spread in southern Jordan. In 1994 he became the second Arab head of state to sign a peace treaty with Israel. At the time of Hussein's accession in 1953, Jordan was a young nation and controlled the West Bank. The country had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population as a result of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Hussein led his country through four turbulent decades of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and the Cold War, successfully balancing pressures from Arab nationalists, the Soviet Union, Western countries, and Israel, transforming Jordan by the end of his 46-year reign to a stable modern state. After 1967 he increasingly engaged in efforts to solve the Palestinian problem. He acted as a conciliatory intermediate between various Middle Eastern rivals, and came to be seen as the region's peacemaker. He was revered for pardoning political dissidents and opponents, and giving them senior posts in the government. Hussein, who survived dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him, was the region's longest-reigning leader. The King died at the age of 63 from cancer on 7 February 1999. His funeral was the largest gathering of world leaders since 1995.

Gustav's father Magnus left Sweden in 1578 when he was expelled by King John III for beating his wife. John forced him to leave Gustav in the care of his mother Sofia. Gustav was raised at Ekolsund by his mother. His upbringing was seen as poor due to his mother's fickle nature and over-indulgence of her son. Duke Charles (later King Charles IX) took him in, believing he would be better off growing up at his court. In 1590, Gustav was expelled from King John's court because of excessive behavior in the taverns of Stockholm, which led to his mother's intervening on his behalf with a plea to the queen, Gunilla Bielke. In 1591, Gustav traveled to the continent and went as far as Italy, returning to Sweden in January 1594. From 28 June he had received an income from the fiefdoms of hundreds of H\u00e5bo, \u00c4rlinghundra and Lagunda. In 1595 he came into conflict with his mother over sharing the proceeds from his fiefdoms. Sofia's income was in danger, but the issue was solved when King Charles forced him to return the fiefdoms, which were given to his mother. Gustav's income was later bolstered by getting the rights to the church tithes. In 1597 he also received the rights of Haguna hundred and the parishes of Lagunda and H\u00e5bo that were not under Sofia's control. In the conflict between Sigismund III Vasa and Charles IX, Gustav sided with the latter and was put in charge of Kalmar Castle on 8 June 1597.

Both George and his younger brother, Richard( Dick), were prodigiously gifted mathematicians and draughtsmen. Grenfell- Baines left a secure, but limiting, job in the Lancashire County Architect's Office to work for the prestigious private firm of Bradshaw Gass& Hope in Bolton in 1930. During the 1930s, Grenfell- Baines became aware of Modernism, particularly the work of Le Corbusier and Gropius, through the architectural press and was determined to practise it himself. He studied at Manchester University for two years from 1934. It was at this time he adopted the name George Grenfell Baines at the suggestion of fellow student Gerald Hayforthwaite. Later this was hyphenated as Grenfell- Baines: Grenfell being his mother's maiden name. He was known to friends and colleagues as\" GG\". In 1935, he was awarded the Heywood prize for the design of reinforced concrete flats. The following year he was awarded the third prize in a competition for a new Rhodesian Parliament; the prize money, \u00a3 250, was enough to enable him to start his own practice. Grenfell- Baines's work for the Air Ministry during World War II brought him to the attention of Anthony Chitty and the London Modernists. Although Grenfell- Baines always chose to be based in Preston, he cultivated friendships in national and international circles. In 1951, he was invited to design a pavilion for the Festival of Britain. Grenfell- Baines's post-war work included the New Towns of Newton Aycliffe( planned 1947) and Peterlee( planned 1948). An abiding interest for GG was multidisciplinary working. His highly successful firm BDP( Building Design Partnership) was the result of numerous experiments in management structure. In 1972, he became professor of Architecture at Sheffield University where he founded the Design Teaching Partnership. He officially retired in 1974 but continued working as a consultant into his final decade. He received an OBE in 1960 and was knighted in 1978. Grenfell- Baines was survived by his second wife, Milena Fleischmann, whom he married in 1954, their son and daughter, and the two daughters of his first marriage, to Dorothy Hodson.

For a time he was considered his father's heir, but that changed after his mother's downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius' knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina's son, Lucius Domitius, whose name became Nero as a result. His step- brother would later be married to his sister Octavia, and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' heir. Following his father's death in October 54, Nero became emperor. The sudden death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth birthday is reported by all extant sources as a poisoning on Nero's orders\u2014as Claudius' natural son, he represented a threat to Nero's claim to the throne.\nDocument[3](Title: Claudius) Claudius (1 August 10 BC \u2013 13 October AD 54) was a Roman emperor from AD 41 to 54. Born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate, he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. Claudius's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius' and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped to restore the empire's finances after the excess of Caligula's reign. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain. Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife. After his death in 54 (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son Nero succeeded him as emperor. His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of Domitian, who reigned for 15 years. He was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi (through Gaius Octavius), Julii Caesares (through Julia Minor and Julia Antonia), and the Claudii Nerones (through Nero Claudius Drusus). He was a step-grandson (through his father Drusus) and great-nephew (through his mother Antonia Minor) of Augustus. He was a nephew of Tiberius through his father, Tiberius's brother. Through his brother Germanicus, Claudius was an uncle of Caligula and a great uncle of Nero. Through his mother Antonia Minor he was a grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor.\n\nQuestion: When was Britannicus's father born?": [

The historian Herodotus writes that his ancestors came from the island of Telos in the Aegean Sea and were the founders of the city of Gela in southern Sicily. Deinomenes consulted an oracle about the fates of his children, and was told that Gelo, Hieron and Thrasyboulos were all destined to become tyrants.\nDocument[2](Title: Damo (philosopher)) Damo (fl. c. 500 BC) was a Pythagorean philosopher said by many to have been the daughter of Pythagoras and Theano.\nDocument[3](Title: Pythagoras) Pythagoras of Samos  was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher and the eponymous founder of Pythagoreanism. His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, Western philosophy. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a gem-engraver on the island of Samos. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton, in what is now southern Italy, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included vegetarianism, although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism. The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is \"metempsychosis\", or the \"transmigration of souls\", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. He may have also devised the doctrine of \"musica universalis\", which holds that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the numerological and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly Philolaus of Croton. Following Croton's decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to Metapontum, where he eventually died. In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the five regular solids, the Theory of Proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher (\"lover of wisdom\") and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or natural philosophy. Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose dialogues, especially his \"Timaeus\", exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted ancient Greek art. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among Middle Platonists, coinciding with the rise of Neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the Middle Ages and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern European esotericism and his teachings as portrayed in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" influenced the modern vegetarian movement.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Damo (Philosopher)'s father?": [

Ballard) James Graham Ballard (15 November 193019 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist who first became associated with the New Wave of science fiction for his post-apocalyptic novels such as \"The Wind from Nowhere\" (1961) and \"The Drowned World\" (1962). In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of experimental short stories (or \"condensed novels\"), such as those collected in the controversial \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" (1970). In the mid 1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial \"Crash\" (1973), a story about symphorophilia and car crash fetishism, and \"High-Rise\" (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos. While much of Ballard's fiction would prove thematically and stylistically provocative, he became best known for his relatively conventional war novel, \"Empire of the Sun\" (1984), a semi-autobiographical account of a young British boy's experiences in Shanghai during Japanese occupation. Described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the best British novel about the Second World War\", the story was adapted into a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg starring Christian Bale. In the following decades until his death in 2009, Ballard's work shifted toward the form of the traditional crime novel. Several of his earlier works have been adapted into films, including David Cronenberg's controversial 1996 adaptation of \"Crash\" and Ben Wheatley's 2015 adaptation of \"High-Rise\". The literary distinctiveness of Ballard's fiction has given rise to the adjective \"Ballardian\", defined by the \"Collins English Dictionary\" as \"resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments\". The \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with \"eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies\".\nDocument[3](Title: Bea Ballard) Bea Ballard (born 29 May 1959) is a British television executive producer.

After the 2002 completion of \"Insomnia\", Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment about a horror film envisioning \"dream stealers\" based on lucid dreaming.

(The same condition had already been applied to the marriage of Emma de Laval with Mathieu II de Montmorency.) Nevertheless, Jean de Montfort renounced the name and title he had been born with to take up the name of Guy XIII de Laval, better to associate himself with his wife Anne's power.

Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied differential geometry under Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. His 1900 doctoral thesis was about Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces. After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he began teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he moved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in Turin and then the University of Turin, where he would stay for a few decades. During this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical analysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex analysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the outbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical circuits and acoustics. In 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini's Fascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf Hitler's Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New York City four years later.

He invented his own cinematic style, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism (the only sanctioned art style in the USSR). This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films. Although he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as \"garbage\". After directing \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" (renamed \"Wild Horses of Fire\" for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in Kiev and Yerevan) and federal (Goskino), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of rape, homosexuality and bribery. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a \"persona non grata\" in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor Dodo Abashidze and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted. His health seriously weakened by four years in labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of lung cancer in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. In January 1988, he said in an interview, \"Everyone knows that I have three Motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I'm going to die in Armenia.\" Sergei Parajanov is buried at Komitas Pantheon in Yerevan. Parajanov's films won prizes at Mar del Plata Film Festival, Istanbul International Film Festival, Nika Awards, Rotterdam International Film Festival, Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival, S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival and others.\nDocument[2](Title: Mark Donskoy) Mark Semyonovich Donskoy (\u2013 21 March 1981) was a Soviet film director and screenwriter.

The film stars Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. It is a remake of Wes Craven's 1984 film of the same name. Produced by Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes, the film was designed to reboot the\" Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise and is the ninth installment in the series. The film is set in a fictitious town of Ohio and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named Freddy Krueger. The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger. In January 2008, Variety reported that Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company would be rebooting the\" Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film. \" A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake,\" Friday the 13th\", where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film. To that end, they decided to remove the one- line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring back his darker nature. The writers developed the character to be a child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead. Freddy's physical appearance was changed with the use of computer- generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim. Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes' producers had in the area,\" A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was filmed primarily in Illinois. Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project. Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy. \" A Nightmare on Elm Street\" was produced by New Line Cinema and had its world premiere at Hollywood on April 27, 2010, and was theatrically released in North America on April 30, 2010, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the teenage characters and story while offering some praise for Bayer's direction and Haley's performance. Regardless,\" A Nightmare on Elm Street\" broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film and grossed more in its opening weekend than the total gross of four other\" Nightmare on Elm Street\" films. The film earned over$ 63 million at the domestic box office and over$ 115 million worldwide.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Yohan: The Child Wanderer or A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master?": [

He was at birth given the title Duke of Normandy. His older brother, Louis Joseph, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother's death he became the heir apparent to the throne and the Dauphin of France, a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"King of France\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then a republic, and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby there is always a monarch; on the death of one monarch, the heir apparent or failing that the heir presumptive are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of Louis XVIII of France rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the Bourbon Restoration in 1814.\nDocument[2](Title: Louis X of France) Louis X (4 October 1289 \u2013 5 June 1316), called the Quarrelsome, the Headstrong, or the Stubborn , was King of France from 1314 to 1316, succeeding his father Philip IV. After the death of his mother, Joan I of Navarre, he was also King of Navarre as Louis I  from 1305 until his death in 1316. His short reign in France was marked by tensions with the nobility, due to fiscal and centralization reforms initiated by Enguerrand de Marigny, the Grand Chamberlain of France, under the reign of his father. Louis' uncle\u2014Charles of Valois, leader of the feudalist party\u2014managed to convince the king to execute Enguerrand de Marigny. Louis allowed serfs to buy their freedom (which was the first step towards the abolition of serfdom), abolished slavery, and readmitted French Jews into the kingdom. In 1305, Louis had married Margaret of Burgundy, with whom he had Joan II of Navarre. Margaret was later convicted of adultery and died in prison, possibly murdered by strangulation. In 1315, Louis married Clementia of Hungary, who gave birth to John I of France a few months after the king's death. John's untimely death led to a disputed succession.\nDocument[3](Title: Joan I of Navarre) Joan I (14 January 1273 \u2013 31 March/2 April 1305)  was queen regnant of Navarre and countess of Champagne from 1274 until 1305; she was also queen consort of France by marriage to Philip IV of France.

The pyramid was never finished, with a mason's inscription showing works on the stone structure were abandoned during or shortly after the king's second year of reign. Together with the sparsity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign, this is taken by Egyptologists as evidence that Neferefre died unexpectedly after two to three years on the throne. Neferefre was nonetheless buried in his pyramid, hastily completed in the form of a mastaba by his second successor and presumably younger brother, pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. Fragments of his mummy were uncovered there, showing that he died in his early twenties. Little is known of Neferefre's activities beyond laying the foundations of his pyramid and attempting to finish that of his father. A single text shows that Neferefre had planned or just started to build a sun temple called \"Hotep-Re\", meaning \"Ra is content\" or \"Ra's offering table\", which possibly never functioned as such given the brevity of the king's reign. After his death, Neferefre might have been succeeded by an ephemeral and little-known pharaoh, Shepseskare, whose relation with Neferefre remains highly uncertain and debated. Like other Fifth Dynasty kings, Neferefre benefited from a funerary cult. Cult rituals took place in a temple built by Nyuserre next to the former's pyramid. The cult seems to have been abandoned by the late Old Kingdom period and Neferefre fell into obscurity. The unfinished aspect of his pyramid and mortuary complex may have attracted less attention from grave and stone robbers than nearby pyramids. As a consequence more statues of Neferefre have been uncovered in his complex than in any other Fifth Dynasty mortuary temple.\nDocument[2](Title: Shepseskare) Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for \"Noble is the Soul of Ra\") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494\u20132345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\nDocument[3](Title: Maatkare B) Maatkare B was a wife of pharaoh Osorkon I and the mother of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C. Maatkare was the daughter of Psusennes II (also known as Pasebkhanut II). Maatkare is known from several sources. Her statuette of which only the base with a pair of feet is preserved (Marseille, Mus\u00e9e Bor\u00e9ly no. 432) may be a re-used New Kingdom piece. A statue of the Nile-god - now in the British Museum (BM 8) - was dedicated by his son Shoshenq C, and he lists his parents as Osorkon I and Maatkare. Maatkare is called the \"King's Daughter of ... Har-Psusennes II, beloved of Amun\". On a statue from the Karnak Cachette (Cairo Museum CG 42194), also dedicated by her son Shoshenq, Maatkare has the titles \"Prophetess of Hathor, Lady of Dendera, God's Mother of Harsomtus\", and \"King's Daughter\".

It is said that he developed a \"quintessentially American, and specially Californian, approach to modern photography\" because of his focus on the people and places of the American West. In 1937 Weston was the first photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, and over the next two years he produced nearly 1,400 negatives using his 8 \u00d7 10 view camera. Some of his most famous photographs were taken of the trees and rocks at Point Lobos, California, near where he lived for many years. Weston was born in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21. He knew he wanted to be a photographer from an early age, and initially his work was typical of the soft focus pictorialism that was popular at the time. Within a few years, however, he abandoned that style and went on to be one of the foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images. In 1947 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and he stopped photographing soon thereafter.

She was a daughter of Duke Peter August of Holstein-Beck, who was a Russian field marshal and Governor of Estonia, and his second wife, Countess Natalia Golovina. On 8 January 1767 in Revel, she married Prince , the Russian ambassador in France. Their children were: Ivan Ivanovitch, 20th Prince Bariatinski (1772-1825) and Princess Anna Ivanovna Bariatinskaia (1774-1825). Through their son, they are the 5th great-grandparents of Franca Sozzani. Aleksandr Baryatinsky, the Russian Field Marshal, was her grandson. By the early 1770s, the couple had been separated. On 29 March 1800, she purchased Friedrichfelde Castle in Berlin from the printer and publisher Georg Jacob Decker the Younger.

A son of Revolutionary War officer Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years. During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the Mexican\u2013American War, and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. He was also the husband of Mary Anna Custis Lee, adopted great granddaughter of George Washington. When Virginia's 1861 Richmond Convention declared secession from the Union, Lee chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command. During the first year of the Civil War, he served as a senior military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Once he took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862, he soon emerged as an able tactician and battlefield commander, winning most of his battles, nearly all against far larger Union armies. Lee's two major strategic offensives into Union territory ended in defeat. His aggressive tactics, especially at the Battle of Gettysburg, which resulted in high casualties at a time when the Confederacy had a shortage of manpower, have come under criticism in recent years. Lee surrendered the remnant of his army to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Since Confederate Congress had appointed him supreme commander of Confederate armies, the remaining Confederate forces capitulated after his surrender. Lee rejected the proposal of a sustained insurgency against the Union and called for national reconciliation. In 1865, Lee became president of Washington College (later Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia; in that position, he supported reconciliation between North and South. He accepted \"the extinction of slavery\" provided for by the Thirteenth Amendment, but publicly opposed racial equality and granting African Americans the right to vote and other political rights. Lee died in 1870. In 1975, the U.S. Congress posthumously restored Lee's citizenship effective June 13, 1865.\nDocument[2](Title: George Lee, 2nd Earl of Lichfield) George Henry Lee I, 2nd Earl of Lichfield (12 March 1690 \u2013 15 February 1743) was the sixth son of Edward Henry Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield and his wife Charlotte Fitzroy, an illegitimate daughter of Charles II by his mistress, the celebrated courtesan Barbara Villiers.

A talented swimmer and artist, she also became interested in dancing during her childhood, taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe. After seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film \"Der Berg des SchicksalsThe Mountain of Destiny\"), Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting. Between 1925 and 1929, she starred in five successful motion pictures. Riefenstahl became one of the few women in Germany to direct a film during the Weimar Period when, in 1932, she decided to try directing with her own film called \"Das Blaue LichtThe Blue Light\"). In the 1930s, she directed the Nazi propaganda films \"Triumph des WillensTriumph of the Will\") and \"Olympia\", resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim. The movies are widely considered two of the most effective, and technically innovative, propaganda films ever made. Her involvement in \"Triumph des Willens\", however, significantly damaged her career and reputation after the war. Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films, and they formed a friendly relationship. Some have argued that Riefenstahl's visions were essential to the carrying out of the mission of the Holocaust. After the war, Riefenstahl was arrested, but classified as being a \"fellow traveler\" or \"Nazi sympathizer\" only and was not associated with war crimes. Throughout her life, she denied having known about the Holocaust. Besides directing, Riefenstahl released an autobiography and wrote several books on the Nuba people. Riefenstahl died of cancer on 8 September 2003 at the age of 101 and was buried at Munich Waldfriedhof.\nDocument[2](Title: Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht) Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht (\"Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces\") is the third documentary directed by Leni Riefenstahl, following \"Victory of Faith\" and \"Triumph of the Will\".

The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China.

He swore fealty to the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in the presence of a Byzantine embassy. His advisors sent him to Antioch to be educated in the court of Tancred of Antioch, ending the hostilities between the two crusader states. Tancred granted four important fortresses to Pons in the Principality of Antioch. Since Pons held his inherited lands in fief of the kings of Jerusalem, Tancred's grant strengthened the autonomy of the County of Tripoli. On his deathbed, Tancred also arranged the marriage of his wife, Cecile of France, to Pons. Pons closely cooperated with Tancred's successor, Roger of Salerno, against the Muslim rulers in the 1110s. He refused obedience to Baldwin II of Jerusalem in early 1122, but their vassals soon mediated a reconciliation between the two rulers. Pons was one of the supreme commanders of the crusader troops during the successful siege of Tyre in 1124. He supported Alice of Jerusalem, the dowager princess of Antioch, against her brother-in-law, Fulk, King of Jerusalem, in late 1132, but they could not prevent him from taking control of Antioch. A year later, Pons was only able to defend his county against Imad ad-Din Zengi, atabeg of Mosul, with Fulk's assistance. Bazw\u0101j, the mamluk (slave) commander of Damascus, invaded Tripoli in a battle in March 1137. Bazw\u0101j defeated Pons, forcing him to flee to the mountains where native Christians captured Pons. His captors handed him over to Bazw\u0101j who had him killed. The County of Tripoli developed into a fully independent crusader state during Pons' reign.\nDocument[2](Title: Bertrand, Count of Toulouse) Bertrand of Toulouse( or Bertrand of Tripoli)( died 1112) was count of Toulouse, and was the first count of Tripoli to rule in Tripoli itself.

Known for her beauty, she was married at age 12 to her husband, Edward Henry Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield, with whom she had a large family.\nDocument[2](Title: Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield) Edward Henry Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield (4 February 1663 \u2013 14 July 1716) was an English peer, the son of a baronet, who at 14 years of age married one of the illegitimate daughters of King Charles II, Charlotte Lee, prior to which he was made Earl of Lichfield. They had a large family; Lady Lichfield bore him 18 children. He was a staunch Tory and followed James II to Rochester, Kent after the king's escape from Whitehall in December 1688. His subsidiary titles were Viscount Quarendon and Baron Spelsbury.\nDocument[3](Title: Charles II of England) Charles II (29 May 1630 \u2013 6 February 1685) was king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death. Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. After Charles I's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a \"de facto\" republic led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed. Charles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England, known as the \"Merry Monarch\", in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.\n\nQuestion: Who is Charlotte Lee, Countess Of Lichfield's paternal grandmother?": [

Maria became heiress to her father's estates of J\u00fclich, Berg and Ravensberg after his death in 1511. In her marriage to John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, Maria's estates and titles were eventually merged with the Duchy of Cleves. John, who inherited the Duchy of Cleves-Mark in 1521, then became the first ruler of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg, which would exist until 1666.

Maria was a strict, traditional Catholic and not a proponent of educating princesses and noble women, which by this point was the norm for the English nobility and gentry. In \"The Wives of Henry VIII\", Antonia Fraser suggests that, following their marriage, one reason Henry VIII disliked her daughter Anne so much was that, unlike his first two wives and many of the court ladies around him, Anne did not possess educational and musical accomplishments and was ill-equipped to function in the contentious English court. Duchess Maria herself appears not to have favored sending her daughter to England.

Born in Vienna, Antel worked mainly as a film producer in the interwar years. After World War II, he began writing and directing films on a large scale. In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s these were mainly comedies( romantic, slapstick, and/ or musical) and\" K.u.k. films\" all of which, for Austrian and German TV stations alike, have been a staple of weekend afternoon programming ever since. In between there is quite a sober film about the Oberst( Colonel) Redl affair that shook the Austro- Hungarian Monarchy on the eve of World War I. Antel himself later commented on this period,\" I always wanted to provide good entertainment for the people at the cinema. After the screening, people should say: Well now, I am in a good mood, I will go out and have a glass of wine.\" ( German original:\" Ich wollte die Leute im Kino immer gut unterhalten. Die Besucher sollten nach der Filmvorf\u00fchrung sagen: So, jetzt bin ich gut aufgelegt, jetzt geh ich auf ein Viertel Wein.\") From the late 1960s, encouraged by the new opportunities in the film industry brought about by the sexual revolution, Antel gradually switched his main interest to soft porn and ribaldry. It was in particular his series of\" Frau Wirtinhostess\") films, directed under the pseudonym Fran\u00e7ois Legrand, with which he tried to win international recognition. Titles included\" The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan\"( 1967),\" Sexy Susan Sins Again\"( 1968),\" Wild, Willing& Sexy\"( 1969) and\" Do n't Tell Daddy\"( aka\" Naughty Nymphs\" in the U.S.A.)( 1972). Antel would recount an anecdote about himself describing how, in order to live up to his reputation as a womanizer, he used to carry a pair of high heels in his luggage which he then would occasionally place in the corridor in front of his hotel room \u2013 especially when he was travelling alone. Among the best known actors Antel had worked with from the 1940s to the 1970s were Hans Moser, Paul H\u00f6rbiger, Oskar Werner, Curd J\u00fcrgens, Tony Curtis, Herbert Fux, Heinrich Schweiger, Arthur Kennedy, Carroll Baker, Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Marisa Berenson, Britt Ekland, Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol. 1981 was a turning point in Antel's career when he adapted for the big screen a stage play by Ulrich Becher and Peter Preses. Set from the days of the Anschluss of 1938 until after the end of the war,\" Der Bockerer\" is about a Viennese butcher named Karl Bockerer( Karl Merkatz) whose common sense rather than intellect tells him to oppose the Nazis and who dares to show resistance just because he is never fully aware of the possible fateful consequences of his actions. While Bockerer and his wife survive the war unscathed, their son joins the SA but, after some internal intrigue, is sent to the front and killed. The film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. The film's strong anti-fascist message, the moving dialogue, and performances by the\" cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\" of Austrian actors and actresses( Ida Krottendorf, Alfred B\u00f6hm, Heinz Marecek, Hans Holt, Dolores Schmidinger and many more) made\" Der Bockerer\" an unusually successful film and gave new impetus to Antel's career.

When she was born, her mother was still married to Hans von B\u00fclow. Through her mother, she was also a granddaughter of Franz Liszt. With her siblings Isolde and Siegfried, Eva was brought up by a house teacher. In 1906 Eva took over the care of the sick mother at Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth, took care of her mail, and was the only family member to have access to the family archive. In 1908 she married Houston Stewart Chamberlain. They acquired a stately villa \u2013 now the Jean Paul Museum \u2013 next to the Villa Wahnfried, and moved into it in 1916 In the 1920s and 1930s, she and her sister Daniela were the head of the Altwagnerians who opposed any modernization of Richard Wagner's works. In 1933 she received the honorary citizenship of the city of Bayreuth. She was also a bearer of the Golden Party Badge of the Nazi Party.

She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works; after his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and philosophy. Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner's later works, particularly \"Parsifal\". In 1857, after a childhood largely spent under the care of her grandmother and with governesses, Cosima married the conductor Hans von B\u00fclow. Although the marriage produced two children, it was largely a loveless union, and in 1863 Cosima began a relationship with Wagner, who was 24 years her senior. She married him in 1870; after his death in 1883 she directed the Bayreuth Festival for more than 20 years, increasing its repertoire to form the Bayreuth canon of ten operas and establishing the festival as a major event in the world of musical theatre. During her directorship, Cosima opposed theatrical innovations and adhered closely to Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was a defining aspect of Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed her death in 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.\n\nQuestion: Who is Eva Chamberlain's maternal grandmother?": [

Her music is noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality; its themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia; and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana. Born in New York City and raised in Upstate New York, Del Rey returned to New York City in 2005 to begin her music career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the unreleased \"Sirens\", Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her debut single \"Video Games\" in 2011. She signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label debut \"Born to Die\" (2012) proved an international success and spawned her only top-ten single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with the Cedric Gervais remix of \"Summertime Sadness\", as well as the internationally successful singles \"Blue JeansBorn to Die\", and \"National Anthem\". Del Rey released the Grammy-nominated EP, \"Paradise\" in 2012. The next year, Del Rey ventured into film as she wrote, directed and starred in the short music film, \"Tropico\", and released \"Young and Beautiful\" as the lead single for the romantic drama film \"The Great Gatsby\" (2013). Del Rey subsequently issued her sophomore major label effort, \"Ultraviolence\" (2014), to critical success, topping the charts and spawning the single, \"West Coast\". That same year, Del Rey recorded the eponymous theme for the drama film \"Big Eyes\", which garnered her Grammy and Golden Globe nominations. Shortly afterwards, Del Rey released \"Honeymoon\" (2015) and \"Lust for Life\" (2017), the latter of which topped the charts in the U.S. and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

He has been described as \"rock & roll's first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century.\" A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music , Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis. \" Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"Great Balls of FireBreathless\" and \"High School Confidential\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old cousin. He had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\" is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the \"Billboard Country and Western Chart\". His No. 1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for YouThere Must Be More to Love Than ThisWould You Take Another Chance on Me\", and \"Me and Bobby McGee\". Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper's \"Chantilly Lace\" and Mack Vickery's \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album \"Last Man Standing\" is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by \"Mean Old Man\" in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career. Lewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie \"Great Balls of Fire\", starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" listed his box set  number 242 on their list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records' Million Dollar Quartet and the \"Class of '55\" album, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley. Music critic Robert Christgau has said of Lewis: \"His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.\"\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song Serial Killer (Song) born?": [

For Donizetti again, he created the role of Enrico in the highly successful\" Lucia di Lammermoor\", at the San Carlo in Naples, in 1835, giving to the role a new dramatic dimension, looking forward to what was to become known as the Verdi-baritone; the standard published score of Lucia contains several downward transpositions which mask the consistently high tessitura of the role as written for Cosselli.

He played keyboards in a number of bands before finding his first commercial success with the Nice in the late 1960s. He became internationally famous for his work with the Nice, which included writing rock arrangements of classical music. After leaving the Nice in 1970, he was a founding member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP), one of the early progressive rock supergroups. Emerson, Lake & Palmer were commercially successful through much of the 1970s, becoming one of the best-known progressive rock groups of the era. Emerson wrote and arranged much of ELP's music on albums such as \"Tarkus\" (1971) and \"Brain Salad Surgery\" (1973), combining his own original compositions with classical or traditional pieces adapted into a rock format. Following ELP's break-up at the end of the 1970s, Emerson pursued a solo career, composed several film soundtracks, and formed the bands Emerson, Lake & Powell and 3 to carry on in the style of ELP. In the early 1990s, Emerson rejoined ELP, which reunited for two more albums and several tours before breaking up again in the late 1990s. Emerson also reunited the Nice in 2002 for a tour. During the 2000s, Emerson resumed his solo career, including touring with his own Keith Emerson Band featuring guitarist Marc Bonilla and collaborating with several orchestras. He reunited with ELP bandmate Greg Lake in 2010 for a duo tour, culminating in a one-off ELP reunion show in London to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. Emerson's last album, \"The Three Fates Project\", with Marc Bonilla and Terje Mikkelsen, was released in 2012.

(\u5927\u5b66\u306f\u51fa\u305f\u3051\u308c\u3069) is a 1929 Japanese silent film directed by Yasujir\u014d Ozu. The film is now lost, except for an excerpt of approximately 10 minutes. Ozu's friend and coworker Hiroshi Shimizu, who co-wrote the script, was originally slated to direct the film. Shimizu's wife Kinuyo Tanaka starred in the film. The plot involved a young man (Minoru Takada) who turns down a receptionist job after graduating college because he feels it isn't good enough for him, but needs to fool his mother (Utako Suzuki) and fiancee (Tanaka) into thinking he has a job. After he marries the fiancee he has to admit to her that he is unemployed so she takes a job in a bar. After an argument with her he apologizes for being irresponsible. He goes back to the company he turned down to accept the receptionist job, but they give him a salaried position instead. A poster from Harold Lloyd's silent comedy \"Speedy\" is used as a prop in the film. One visual gag in the film occurs when the man is apologizing to his wife and suddenly slaps her head, but it is then revealed that he was killing a mosquito. According to Donald Richie, Ozu's 1930 film \" I Flunked, But...\" was based in part on this film. To David Bordwell \"I Was Flunked, But...\" presents the opposite situation to this film, in that the protagonist does not graduate and so does not have to face unemployment. Both films reflect a theme that runs through several of Ozu's films of the period, that of youth unemployment in Japan at the time. Akira Iwasaki described Ozu's films in the period starting with this film and extending to \" I Was Born, But... \" as having \"more directly depicted the psychological depression of the 'dark period' than any other films. \" A \"Kinema Jumpo\" critic complained that the film's playfulness was \"jarring\" and that the happy ending detracted from the social message. Bordwell commented on the symmetry in the construction of the film, including how it begins and ends with scenes at the company office with opposite results, and how at first the man pretends to a job when he does not but later his fiancee pretends not to have one when she does.\n\nQuestion: Where did the director of film 1919 (Film) graduate from?": [

He was a younger son of John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir and Marguerite of Enghien. Lewis was elected archbishop of Rouen in 1436. He was the leading native administrator/collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France. His niece Jacquetta was the wife of John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, who acted as regent for his nephew Henry VI. As the Lancastrian position weakened, Lewis found his own fortunes and even personal safety becoming precarious. Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449, well after Luxembourg's death, King Henry's government had long ago decided the archbishop needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England. Thus he was provided to Ely 'in commendam' on 27 September 1437. This was the fifth wealthiest see in England, yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Osthryth) Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King \u00c6thelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanfl\u00e6d. She probably married \u00c6thelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl\u00e6d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl\u00e6d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means \"stronghold of Fl\u00e6de\", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s \u00c6thelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by \u00c6thelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that \u00c6thelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. \u00c6thelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. \u00c6thelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against \u00c6thelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother \u00c6lfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was \"a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister.\" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of \u00c6thelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.\nDocument[2](Title: \u00c6thelred of Mercia) \u00c6thelred (died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, \u00c6thelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain. He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. \u00c6thelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; \u00c6thelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria. \u00c6thelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 \u00c6thelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. \u00c6thelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was \u00c6thelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that \u00c6thelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.\nDocument[3](Title: \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians) \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians( or Ealdorman \u00c6thelred of Mercia; died 911) became ruler of English Mercia shortly after the death of its last king, Ceolwulf II in 879. His rule was confined to the western half, as eastern Mercia was then part of the Viking- ruled Danelaw. \u00c6thelred's ancestry is unknown. He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881, and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. The alliance was cemented by the marriage of \u00c6thelred to Alfred's daughter \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. In 886 Alfred took possession of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; as it had traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to \u00c6thelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year \u00c6thelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, \u00c6thelred's health may have declined, and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d may have become the effective ruler of Mercia. After \u00c6thelred's death, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918.

She is the estranged daughter of Bette Davis.\nDocument[3](Title: Bette Davis) Ruth Elizabeth \"Bette\" Davis (April 5, 1908 \u2013 October 6, 1989) was an American actress of film, television and theater. With a career spanning 60 years and 100 acting credits, she is regarded as one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood history. She was noted for playing unsympathetic, sardonic characters, and was famous for her performances in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to historical films, suspense horror, and occasional comedies, although her greater successes were in romantic dramas. A recipient of two Academy Awards, she was the first thespian to garner ten nominations. After appearing in Broadway plays, the 22-year old Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930. After some unsuccessful films, she had her critical breakthrough playing a vulgar waitress in \"Of Human Bondage\" (1934), although, contentiously, she was not among the three nominees for the Academy Award for Best Actress that year. The next year, her strong performance as a down-and-out actress in \"Dangerous\" (1935) did land her her first Best Actress nomination, and she won the award. In 1937, she tried to free herself from her contract with Warner Brothers; although she lost the legal case, it marked the start of more than a decade as one of the most celebrated leading ladies of US cinema, known for her forceful and intense style. Her portrayal of a strong-willed 1850s southern belle in \"Jezebel\" (1938) won her a second Academy Award for Best Actress and was the first of five consecutive years she received a nomination. The others were for \"Dark Victory\" (1939), \"The Letter\" (1940), \"The Little Foxes\" (1941) and \"Now, Voyager\" (1942). Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative and confrontational with studio executives and film directors as well as with her co-stars. Her forthright manner, idiosyncratic speech, and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona that has been often imitated. She is perhaps most known for her role as a Broadway star in \" All About Eve\" (1950), a Best Picture Academy Award winner, for which she received another Best Actress Oscar nomination. Her last Oscar nomination was for \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962) also starring her rival Joan Crawford. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, but despite a long period of ill health she continued acting in film or on television until shortly before her death from breast cancer in 1989. She admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships, as she married four times, divorced three times, raised her children as a single parent and had a daughter, B.D. Hyman, who wrote the tell-all book \"My Mother's Keeper\". Davis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, a club venue for food, dancing and entertainment for servicemen during World War II, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She was the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. In 1999, Davis placed second behind Katharine Hepburn on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female stars of the Classic Hollywood cinema era.\n\nQuestion: Where does B. D.

Born in Vienna, Antel worked mainly as a film producer in the interwar years. After World War II, he began writing and directing films on a large scale. In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s these were mainly comedies (romantic, slapstick, and/or musical) and \"K.u.k. films\" all of which, for Austrian and German TV stations alike, have been a staple of weekend afternoon programming ever since. In between there is quite a sober film about the Oberst (Colonel) Redl affair that shook the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy on the eve of World War I. Antel himself later commented on this period, \"I always wanted to provide good entertainment for the people at the cinema. After the screening, people should say: Well now, I am in a good mood, I will go out and have a glass of wine.\" (German original: \"Ich wollte die Leute im Kino immer gut unterhalten. Die Besucher sollten nach der Filmvorf\u00fchrung sagen: So, jetzt bin ich gut aufgelegt, jetzt geh ich auf ein Viertel Wein.\") From the late 1960s, encouraged by the new opportunities in the film industry brought about by the sexual revolution, Antel gradually switched his main interest to soft porn and ribaldry. It was in particular his series of \"Frau Wirtinhostess\") films, directed under the pseudonym Fran\u00e7ois Legrand, with which he tried to win international recognition. Titles included \"The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan\" (1967), \"Sexy Susan Sins Again\" (1968), \"Wild, Willing & Sexy\" (1969) and \"Don't Tell Daddy\" (aka \"Naughty Nymphs\" in the U.S.A.) (1972). Antel would recount an anecdote about himself describing how, in order to live up to his reputation as a womanizer, he used to carry a pair of high heels in his luggage which he then would occasionally place in the corridor in front of his hotel room \u2013 especially when he was travelling alone. Among the best known actors Antel had worked with from the 1940s to the 1970s were Hans Moser, Paul H\u00f6rbiger, Oskar Werner, Curd J\u00fcrgens, Tony Curtis, Herbert Fux, Heinrich Schweiger, Arthur Kennedy, Carroll Baker, Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Marisa Berenson, Britt Ekland, Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol. 1981 was a turning point in Antel's career when he adapted for the big screen a stage play by Ulrich Becher and Peter Preses. Set from the days of the Anschluss of 1938 until after the end of the war, \"Der Bockerer\" is about a Viennese butcher named Karl Bockerer (Karl Merkatz) whose common sense rather than intellect tells him to oppose the Nazis and who dares to show resistance just because he is never fully aware of the possible fateful consequences of his actions. While Bockerer and his wife survive the war unscathed, their son joins the SA but, after some internal intrigue, is sent to the front and killed. The film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. The film's strong anti-fascist message, the moving dialogue, and performances by the \"cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\" of Austrian actors and actresses (Ida Krottendorf, Alfred B\u00f6hm, Heinz Marecek, Hans Holt, Dolores Schmidinger and many more) made \"Der Bockerer\" an unusually successful film and gave new impetus to Antel's career.

They were later roommates at Vanderbilt University. Smith left college after two years to become a musician. He formed his first band around 1922, and by 1925 the Beasley Smith Orchestra was entertaining regularly at the Andrew Jackson Hotel in downtown Nashville. From 1927-1933, the group toured nationally. On October 5, 1925, both Smith and Craig performed with their bands during the opening-day broadcasts of radio station WSM. Wearying of the road, Smith accepted the job of music director at WSM in 1933. He starred on such radio shows as \"Mr. Smith Goes to TownSunday Down South\" and \"Tin Pan Valley.\" Lead vocalists who worked with Smith's band during his heyday included Snooky Lanson, Dottie Dillard, Kitty Kallen, and Dinah Shore. When Nashville started to become a recording center in the 1940s, Smith and Owen Bradley were key figures in assembling musicians for studio sessions. Smith began to blossom as a songwriter in the 1940s. He and Owen Bradley co-wrote \"Night Train to Memphis\" with Marvin Hughes. Roy Acuff sang the original version in 1942, and the upbeat song has been recorded consistently ever since. Beasley Smith and Francis Craig co-wrote \" Beg Your Pardon,\" and it became the 1948 follow-up hit to \"Near You\" for Craig's band. \" That Lucky Old Sun\" (1949), co-written with Haven Gillespie was a million-seller for Frankie Laine and is now considered a pop-music standard. In 1953, Smith left WSM to become the A&R director and musical arranger for Dot Records. He and Dot founder, Randy Wood, also incorporated the Randy-Smith Music Publishing Company. Beasley Smith had written more than 100 songs by the time of his death in Nashville, Tennessee in 1968. In 1983, Beasley Smith was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the composer of song The Old Master Painter?": [

His work as a director includes \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" (1995) , \"Mohabbatein\" (2000), \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" (2008) and \"Befikre\" (2016). He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films (YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as \"Veer-Zaara\" (2004), \"Fanaa\" (2006), \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" (2010), \" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" (2012), the \"Dhoom series\" (2004, 2006 & 2013), \"Sultan\" (2016), the \"Tiger series\" (2012 & 2017) and \"War\" (2019). He has broken away from typecast through production of off-beat films such as \"Kabul Express\" (2006), \"Chak De! India\" (2007),  (2009) , \"Dum Laga Ke Haisha\" (2015) and \"Hichki!\" (2018), that do not necessarily fit into the realm of \"masala films\". Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios (co-founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore (FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like \"Daawat-e-Ishq\" (2014), \"Meri Pyaari Bindu\" (2016), \"Sui-Dhaaga\" (2018) and \"Jayeshbhai Jordaar\" (2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films. He has remained extremely media-shy and a passive individual, battling constant reports of an alleged dysthymic disorder throughout his three-decade career, resulting in very few public photos of him being in existence.\nDocument[2](Title: Ram Mukherjee) Ram Mukherjee (1933 \u2013 22 October 2017) was an Indian film director, producer and screenwriter in Hindi and Bengali cinema, he is one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios, Mumbai.

Her roles have been cited in the media as a significant departure from previous screen portrayals of Indian women. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. However, while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film \"Biyer Phool\" (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama \"Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat\" on the insistence of her mother. She then began a full-time career in films and the 1998 action drama \"Ghulam\" was her first commercial success. She gained wider recognition for a supporting role in the romance \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998). The year 2002 marked a turning point for Mukerji when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the drama \"Saathiya\". By 2004, Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy \"Hum Tum\" and the dramas \"Yuva\" and \"Veer-Zaara\". She achieved further success for portraying a deaf, blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama \"Black\" (2005), a con woman in \"Bunty Aur Babli\" (2005) and an unhappily married woman in \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" (2006). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. The semi-biographical thriller \"No One Killed Jessica\" (2011), in which she played a headstrong journalist, proved to be her first box office hit in four years. She followed it by starring in the successful thrillers  (2012) and \"Mardaani\" (2014), and the comedy-drama \"Hichki\" (2018). The latter emerged as her highest-grossing release. In addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show \"Dance Premier League\".

The music is marked \"Brightly\". The song is most famous for its \"You like tomato / And I like to-mah-to \" and other verses comparing their different regional dialects. The differences in pronunciation are not simply regional, however, but serve more specifically to identify class differences. At the time, typical American pronunciations were considered less \"refined\" by the upper-class, and there was a specific emphasis on the \"broadera\" sound. This class distinction with respect to pronunciation has been retained in caricatures, especially in the theater, where the longer \"a\" pronunciation is most strongly associated with the word \"darling.\" The song was ranked No. 34 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs.\nDocument[2](Title: George Gershwin) George Gershwin (born Jacob Bruskin Gershowitz, September 26, 1898 \u2013 July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist whose compositions spanned both popular and classical genres.

Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (\"Trout Quintet\"), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (\"Unfinished Symphony\"), the \u201dGreat\u201d Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944, the three last piano sonatas (D. 958\u2013960), the opera \"Fierrabras\" (D. 796), the incidental music to the play \"Rosamunde\" (D. 797), and the song cycles \"Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin\" (D. 795) and \"Winterreise\" (D. 911). Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher; despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis. Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Jack Clayton) Jack Clayton (1 March 1921 \u2013 26 February 1995) was a British film director and producer who specialised in bringing literary works to the screen. Starting out as a teenage studio \"tea boy\" in 1935, Clayton worked his way up through British film industry in a career that spanned nearly sixty years. He rapidly rose through a series of increasingly important roles in British film production, before shooting to international prominence as a director with his Oscar-winning feature film debut, the drama \"Room at the Top\" (1959); this was followed by the much-lauded horror film \"The Innocents\" (1961), adapted from Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\". Clayton looked set for a brilliant future, and he was highly regarded by peers and critics alike, but a number of overlapping factors hampered his career. He was a notably 'choosy' director, who by his own admission \"never made a film I didn't want to make\", and he repeatedly turned down films (including \"Alien\") that became huge hits for other directors. But he was also dogged by bad luck and bad timing - the Hollywood studios labelled him as 'difficult', and studio politics quashed a string of planned films in the 1970s, which were either taken out of his hands, or cancelled in the final stages of preparation. In 1977, he suffered a double blow - his current film was cancelled just two weeks before shooting was due to begin, and a few months later he suffered a serious stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak, and put his career on hold for five years. Despite his relatively small \"oeuvre\", the films of Jack Clayton continue to be appreciated, and both they and their director have been widely admired and praised by leading film critics like Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, and by film industry peers including Harold Pinter, Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Tennessee Williams and Steven Spielberg.\nDocument[2](Title: Chris Columbus (filmmaker)) Chris Joseph Columbus( born September 10, 1958) is an American film director, producer and writer, best known for his work in family and sentimental films.

He went on to direct\" Nine Months\"( 1995),\" Stepmom\"( 1998) and\" Bicentennial Man\"( 1999), which were met with lukewarm reception. His greatest commercial successes have been\" Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\"( 2001) and its sequel,\" Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\"( 2002).

By her marriage to Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, she became known as the Countess of Suffolk.\nDocument[2](Title: Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk) Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk (1367 \u2013 17 September 1415) was an English nobleman who supported Henry IV (reigned 1399-1413) against Richard II (reigned 1377-1399) during the turmoils of the late 14th century. He died during the Siege of Harfleur in 1415. He was the eldest son of Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Katherine Wingfield, daughter of Sir John Wingfield. His father fled abroad amid accusations of treason during the Merciless Parliament in 1388, forfeiting the title of Earl of Suffolk and the family estates. Over the next decade the younger Michael de la Pole made vigorous attempts to recover these lands, and obtained most of them piecemeal between 1389 and 1392, following his father's death. However, his close association with the Lords Appellant, particularly the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Gloucester prejudiced Richard II against him. He finally obtained the restoration of the earldom in January 1398. While he obeyed the summons of the Duke of York to defend the kingdom against Henry Bolingbroke in July 1399, Suffolk did not object to the disbandment of York's army and consented to the deposition of Richard II in the summer of 1399. While the first Parliament of Henry IV technically upheld the forfeitures of the Merciless Parliament, Henry IV immediately restored de la Pole's estates and title in recognition of his support. However, he would spend the remainder of his life trying to obtain possession of the remaining estates which had not been restored. He played a relatively small role in national politics, although he regularly attended Parliament. He took part in the campaign in Scotland in 1400, in naval operations around 1405, and served as the senior English diplomat at the Council of Pisa (1409). Suffolk also acted as a lieutenant of the Duke of Clarence during his campaign of 1412\u20131413. However, he devoted most of his energies to re-establishing de la Pole influence in East Anglia. He took the role of a justice of the peace in Norfolk and Suffolk from 1399, and assembled a considerable following among the local gentry. He completed his father's building plans at Wingfield, Suffolk and enlarged the local church. Suffolk brought 40 men-at-arms and 120 archers with him on the 1415 campaign of Henry V in France. He died of dysentery at Harfleur, and was succeeded by his eldest son Michael, who later died at Agincourt.\nDocument[3](Title: Katherine de Stafford) Katherine de Stafford, Countess of Suffolk (born around 1376 \u2013 8 April 1419) was a daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford and his wife Philippa de Beauchamp.

He was one of the founders of the musical genre later defined as Western swing. Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self- teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down,\" Blues in the Bottle\" was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old- time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album,\" Times Ai n\u2019t Like They Used to Be, Volume 1\" along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was\" Wake Up, Jacob\" which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith,\" Anthology of American Folk Music\", in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song,\" Oklahoma Rag\" was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M.

He was the second son of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy, and their eldest son to reach adulthood, his older brother Henry having been born and died in the same month of August 1071. Conrad's rule in Lorraine and Germany was nominal. He spent most of his life in Italy and there he was king in fact as well as in name.\nDocument[3](Title: Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor) Henry IV (11 November 1050 \u2013 7 August 1106) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 to 1105, king of Germany from 1054 to 1105, king of Italy and Burgundy from 1056 to 1105, and duke of Bavaria from 1052 to 1054. He was the son of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Agnes of Poitou. After his father's death on 5 October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the \"freedom of the church\" strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop Anno II of Cologne kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065. Henry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in Saxony and Thuringia. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, Otto of Nordheim in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as simony (a forbidden sale of church offices). Pope Alexander II blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the Holy See and the German dukes weakened his position and the Saxons rose up again in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075. Henry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Gregory VII who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24 January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects of allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. His penitential \"Walk to Canossa\" was a success. Gregory VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an antiking, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, on 14 March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7 March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected an antipope, Clement III. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, Hermann of Salm, could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1 April 1084. Hermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, Matilda of Tuscany, in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, Conrad, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with Welf I, Duke of Bavaria prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with Pope Paschal II. Henry proclaimed the first \"Landfrieden\" (or imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, Henry V, forced him to abdicate on 31 December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of Conrad Ii Of Italy?": [

His early movies were mostly comedies. His biggest success was \"Hon dansade en sommar\" (1951, aka. \" One Summer of Happiness\"), which earned him the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and a nomination for the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. It caused some controversy at the time because it contained nudity. His 1953 film of Peder Sj\u00f6gren's second novel, \"Bread of LoveK\u00e4rlekens br\u00f6d\"), based on Sj\u00f6gren's experiences as a volunteer in the Finnish Continuation War of 1941-44 angered the author, was banned in Finland and incurred the wrath of the Soviets at the Cannes Film Festival. In spite of all this, Sj\u00f6gren grudgingly admitted that as a study of men under severe pressure it was impressive. In 1958 he directed \"Damen i svart\", the first in the series of five \"Hillman-thrillers\", centred on Folke Mellvig's crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman. The second in the series, \"Mannek\u00e4ng i r\u00f6tt\" (1958), is considered by some to be a precursor of the Italian giallo films, notably Mario Bava's \"Blood and Black Lace\". The popularity of his mystery movies declined and in the 1970s and 1980s he made mostly low-budget thrillers - some in collaboration with Mats Helge Olsson - which got mostly bad reviews.\nDocument[5](Title: Ljuvlig \u00e4r sommarnatten) Ljuvlig \u00e4r sommarnatten (\" The summer's night is delightful\") is a Swedish film from 1961, directed by Arne Mattsson.

Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate\u2014as her dower\u2014had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist\u2014Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick\u2014Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473.\nDocument[2](Title: John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire) John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire,( 24 November 1427 \u2013 8 May 1473) was an English nobleman, the youngest son of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham.
