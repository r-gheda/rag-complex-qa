    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Mount Cayley volcanic field) The Mount Cayley volcanic field is a remote volcanic zone on the South Coast of British Columbia, Canada, stretching from the Pemberton Icefield to the Squamish River. It forms a segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, the Canadian portion of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which extends from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia. Most of the Cayley volcanoes were formed during periods of volcanism under sheets of glacial ice throughout the last glacial period. These subglacial eruptions formed steep, flat- topped volcanoes and subglacial lava domes, most of which have been entirely exposed by deglaciation. However, at least two volcanoes predate the last glacial period and both are highly eroded. The field gets its name from Mount Cayley, the largest and most persistent volcano, located at the southern end of the Powder Mountain Icefield. This icefield covers much of the central portion of the volcanic field and is one of the several glacial fields in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains. Eruptions along the length of the field began between 1.6 and 5.3 million years ago. At least 23 eruptions have occurred throughout its eruptive history. This volcanic activity ranged from effusive to explosive, with magma compositions ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic. Because the Mount Cayley volcanic field has a high elevation and consists of a cluster of mostly high altitude, non-overlapping volcanoes, subglacial activity is likely to have occurred under less than of glacial ice. The style of this glaciation promoted meltwater escape during eruptions. The steep profile of the volcanic field and its subglacial landforms support this hypothesis. As a result, volcanic features in the field that interacted with glacial ice lack rocks that display evidence of abundant water during eruption, such as hyaloclastite and pillow lava. Of the entire volcanic field, the southern portion has the most known volcanoes. Here, at least 11 of them are situated on top of a long narrow mountain ridge and in adjacent river valleys. The central portion contains at least five volcanoes situated at the Powder Mountain Icefield. To the north, two volcanoes form a sparse area of volcanism. Many of these volcanoes were formed between 0.01 and 1.6 million years ago, some of which show evidence of volcanic activity in the last 10,000 years.\nDocument[2](Title: Donovan's Brain (film)) Donovan's Brain is an independently made 1953 black-and-white science fiction horror film, produced by Allan Dowling and Tom Gries, directed by Felix E.

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo.

Apparently, the marriage was against her father-in-law's wishes. This may have been less on her account than her father's: Sir John Pointz was notoriously improvident in matters of finance, and died penniless. Some sources say that she lived in Thurles Castle from this marriage until her death (1608\u20131673), except for a short period (1658\u20131660) during the rule of Cromwell \u2014she was a Catholic Royalist. It is not clear, however, that she could have returned to Thurles Castle because Lewis writes that \"this castle, during the parliamentary war, was garrisoned for the King, but was afterwards taken by the parliamentarian forces, by whom it was demolished\". On the other hand, Lady Thurles may have returned to a newer building on or close to the site of the castle which may also have been called Thurles Castle; Grose, writing in 1791, and Armitage, writing in 1912, seem to imply that a building called Thurles Castle still existed in their times. She and Lord Thurles had three sons and four daughters before he drowned on 15 December 1619, when the ship carrying him to England was wrecked off the Skerries near Anglesey. This was shortly after the start of his father's long imprisonment in the Fleet Prison in London and Thomas had been on his way to answer charges of treason for having garrisoned Kilkenny. After his death, Lady Thurles married again, about 1620. With her second husband, Captain George Mathew of Radyr and Llandaff in Glamorganshire, Wales, she had two more sons and one more daughter. Her second husband died in 1636 at Tenby in Wales. She lived a further 37 years, dying in Thurles in May 1673. She was buried beside what is now the Protestant church of St. Mary's in Thurles. An oil portrait of Lady Thurles is held by Tipperary County Library in Thurles.\nDocument[2](Title: Wouldn't It Be Loverly) \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\" is a popular song by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, written for the 1956 Broadway play \"My Fair Lady\".

He graduated from the Soviet VGIK film school in 1975 after which he started working at the Riga Film Studio. He became a director in 1979. Podnieks' first film \"Cradle\" won an award at the Dok Leipzig festival. In 1981, his film \"The Brothers Kokar\" took the first prize at the Kiev Youth Festival. In the same year, his film \"Constellation of Riflemen\" won honours in the 17th All State Festival in Leningrad and the Latvian Komsomol prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the Soviet Union. Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie \" 'Is It Easy to Be Young?\". The film with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks talked to youngsters later convicted for criminal actions. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled \"Hello, do you hear us?\". It showed civil unrest in Uzbekistan, survivors of the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, striking workers in Yaroslavl and former residents returning to Chernobyl. The first film in the series, \"Red Hot\", was awarded the Prix Italia and the Peabody Award. Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of national identity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. His \"Homeland\" was an account of folk festivals in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the attempted coup by Soviet forces in Riga. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend Andris Slapi\u0146\u0161 was killed and Gvido Zvaigzne, another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries. This was captured on video and shown as an addition to \"Homeland\" and later as an introduction for the revised version of this film.

Ph.D. D.I.C. A.R.C.S.) was warden of Hugh Stewart Hall in the University of Nottingham for 29 years( 1975 \u2013 2004). Dr. Rees was a highly respected academic, being a professor of mathematics, and a leading member of the University community. He was the last warden to inhabit the Warden's House at Hugh Stewart in its entirety. The Hall library is now named after Dr. Rees in recognition of his service to the Hall, the University and the City. He arrived in Nottingham with a London Ph.D. in Mathematics and was one of the first tutors recruited at the opening of Lincoln Hall in 1962. As with many of his Welsh countrymen, his twin passions were rugby football and music, being an accomplished pianist in the latter field. According to old Lincolnites of that era he was a lively and popular tutor, and the rugby team especially flourished with his encouragement. In 1972 he was appointed as Deputy Warden of Cripps Hall and then three years later he made the short move to Hugh Stewart. Certainly he fought hard to maintain the best traditions of Nottingham's Halls, for example keeping a schedule of one Formal Dinner each week, open to all students, when almost all other Halls had reduced to two per term.

He led the Liberal Party during that time, having previously been a long-serving government minister. Gorton was born out of wedlock and had a turbulent childhood. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, after finishing his secondary education at Geelong Grammar School, and then returned to Australia to take over his father's property in northern Victoria. Gorton enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940, and served as a fighter pilot in Malaya and New Guinea during the Second World War. He suffered severe facial injuries in a crash landing on Bintan Island in 1942, and whilst being evacuated; his ship was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. He returned to farming after being discharged in 1944, and was elected to the Kerang Shire Council in 1946; he later served a term as shire president. After a previous unsuccessful candidacy at state level, Gorton was elected to the Senate at the 1949 federal election. He took a keen interest in foreign policy, and gained a reputation as a strident anti-Communist. Gorton was promoted to the ministry in 1958, and over the following decade held a variety of different portfolios in the governments of Robert Menzies and Harold Holt. He was responsible at various times for the Navy, public works, education, and science. He was elevated to the Cabinet in 1966, and the following year, he was promoted to Leader of the Government in the Senate. Gorton defeated three other candidates for the Liberal leadership after Harold Holt's disappearance on 17 December 1967. He became the first and only senator to assume the office of Prime Minister, but soon transferred to the House of Representatives in line with constitutional convention. The Gorton Government continued Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, but began withdrawing troops amid growing public discontent. It retained office at the 1969 federal election, albeit with a severely reduced majority. Gorton's domestic policies, which emphasised centralisation and economic nationalism, were often controversial in his own party, and his individualistic style alienated many of his Cabinet members. He resigned as Liberal leader in 1971 after a confidence motion in his leadership was tied, and was replaced by William McMahon. After losing the premiership, Gorton was elected deputy leader under McMahon and appointed Minister for Defence. He was sacked for disloyalty after a few months. After the Coalition's defeat at the 1972 federal election, Gorton unsuccessfully stood as McMahon's replacement. He briefly served as an opposition frontbencher under Billy Snedden, but stood down in 1974 and spent the rest of his career as a backbencher. Gorton resigned from the Liberal Party when Malcolm Fraser was elected leader, and at the 1975 election mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate as an independent.

The title refers to the Caron perfume\" Narcisse noir\". Based on the 1939 novel by Rumer Godden, the film revolves around the growing tensions within a small convent of Anglican nuns who are trying to establish a school and hospital in an old palace on an isolated mountain above a fertile valley in the Himalayas. Although some of the publicity makes it sound as if the nuns all fall in love with the same man and compete for his affections, the truth is much more complicated. One mentally ill sister does harbor a grand\u2014and ultimately fatal\u2014passion for the handsome libertine British expatriate who is agent for the local potentate, but he is completely unaware of her feelings until the end of the film. Her paranoid delusions embrace everyone around her and she becomes insanely jealous of one sister. In fact, the greatest challenges to the nuns \u2019 work come from the place itself and the unfamiliar people they have come to serve. \" Black Narcissus\" achieved acclaim for its pioneering technical mastery with the cinematographer, Jack Cardiff, shooting in vibrant colour, winning an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography, and Alfred Junge winning an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. According to film critic David Thomson, Black Narcissus\" is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns, startling whenever Kathleen Byron is involved\".\n\nQuestion: Are Elsah, Illinois and Chah-E Puzeh, Tabas both located in the same country?": [

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the \"Collateral Murder\" video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks. In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange, after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault. Assange denied the allegations, and said they were just a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010 but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his \u00a3340,000 bail in June 2012 to seek asylum from Ecuador. In August 2012, Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and possible extradition to the United States. In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship; however it was suspended in April 2019. Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years. During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State. The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts of interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread the stolen documents. Assange consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\". On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested. Later that day he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom. On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act. As a result of the revocation of his asylum, and at the request of his alleged rape victim's lawyer, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019. In November 2019, they dropped the investigation, citing weakened evidence due to the time lapse after the alleged offence. Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health.\nDocument[3](Title: It's a Wonderful Life) Due to all the above actions, this is one of the few RKO films not controlled by Turner Entertainment / Warner Bros. in the USA.

Evidentialism is therefore a thesis about which beliefs are justified and which are not. For philosophers Richard Feldman and Earl Conee, evidentialism is the strongest argument for justification because it identifies the primary notion of epistemic justification. They argue that if a person's attitude towards a proposition fits their evidence, then their doxastic attitude for that proposition is epistemically justified. Feldman and Conee offer the following argument for evidentialism as an epistemic justification:( EJ) Doxastic attitude\" D\" toward proposition\" p\" is epistemically justified for\" S\" at\" t\" if and only if having\" D\" toward\" p\" fits the evidence. For Feldman and Conee a person's doxastic attitude is justified if it fits their evidence. EJ is meant to show the idea that justification is characteristically epistemic. This idea makes justification dependent on evidence. Feldman and Conee believe that because objections to EJ have become so prominent their defense for it is appropriate. The theses that object EJ are implying that epistemic justification is dependent upon the\" cognitive capacities of an individual or upon the cognitive processes or information- gatherings practices that lead to an attitude.\" For Feldman and Conee, EJ is in contrast to these theses; EJ contends that the epistemic justification for an attitude is only dependent upon evidence.\nDocument[2](Title: Jean Lenoir (composer)) Jean Lenoir pseudonym for Jean Bernard Daniel Neuberger( 26 February 1891 \u2013 19 January 1976) was a French songwriter, whose work included chansons and romantic light film songs.

The protests and demonstrations against corruption in the Russian government began in March 2017 after the release of the film\" He Is Not Dimon to You\" by Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. By March 2017, the setting in the country was already tense. Discontentment was triggered by the alleged corrupt activity of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev presented in the investigative film\" He Is Not Dimon to You\" by Anti-Corruption Foundation, inadequate planned demolition of apartments in Moscow and protracted strikes of truck drivers related to the Platon toll system, ongoing since 2015. National protests against alleged corruption in the federal Russian government took place simultaneously in more than 100 cities across the country on 26 March 2017.

As the first non-Frankish king of East Francia, he established the Ottonian dynasty of kings and emperors, and he is generally considered to be the founder of the medieval German state, known until then as East Francia. An avid hunter, he obtained the epithet\" the Fowler\" because he was allegedly fixing his birding nets when messengers arrived to inform him that he was to be king. He was born into the Liudolfing line of Saxon dukes. His father Otto I of Saxony died in 912 and was succeeded by Henry. The new duke launched a rebellion against the king of East Francia, Conrad I of Germany, over the rights to lands in the Duchy of Thuringia. They reconciled in 915 and on his deathbed in 918, Conrad recommended Henry as the next king, considering the duke the only one who could hold the kingdom together in the face of internal revolts and external Magyar raids. Henry was elected and crowned king in 919. He went on to defeat the rebellious dukes of Bavaria and Swabia, consolidating his rule. Through successful warfare and a dynastic marriage, Henry acquired Lotharingia as a vassal in 925. Unlike his Carolingian predecessors, Henry did not seek to create a centralized monarchy, ruling through federated autonomous stem duchies instead. Henry built an extensive system of fortifications and mobile heavy cavalry across Germany to neutralize the Magyar threat and in 933 routed them at the Battle of Riade, ending Magyar attacks for the next 21 years and giving rise to a sense of German nationhood. Henry greatly expanded German hegemony in Europe with his defeat of the Slavs in 929 at the Battle of Lenzen along the Elbe river, by compelling the submission of Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia through an invasion of the Duchy of Bohemia the same year and by conquering Danish realms in Schleswig in 934. Henry's hegemonic status north of the Alps was acknowledged by King Rudolph of West Francia and King Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy, who both accepted a place of subordination as allies in 935. Henry planned an expedition to Rome to be crowned emperor by the pope, but the design was thwarted by his death. Henry prevented a collapse of royal power, as had happened in West Francia, and left a much stronger kingdom to his successor Otto I. He was buried at Quedlinburg Abbey, established by his wife Matilda in his honor.\n\nQuestion: Are both director of film Germany, Year Zero and director of film Cross Shot from the same country?": [

By marriage she was Duchess of Mecklenburg, although she died before her husband succeeded her father-in-law. She was potential heiress to the Danish throne and was the older sister of Margaret I of Denmark. Ingeborg was betrothed to Duke Henry of Mecklenburg after the death of Ingeborg's older sister Margaret in 1350, who was betrothed to the Duke. She had two sisters named Margaret. The marriage contract between Henry and Ingeborg was established in Dornburg October 23, 1350. Ingeborg and Henry then married in 1362. They had the following children:\nIngeborg was potential heir to the Danish throne in 1363 upon the death of her only surviving brother Christopher, Duke of Lolland. However, Denmark was an elective monarchy, and Ingeborg too predeceased King Valdemar. Ingeborg's father died without appointing an heir. The succession of to the Danish throne was disputed. The Estates of Denmark met at Odense to elect the next king. The nobles were divided between either electing Ingeborg's son Albert IV, put forth by his grandfather Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg; Margaret's son Olaf II, heir to the Norwegian throne; or choosing a new dynasty. The estates were eventually won over by Queen Margaret's charm and popularity, as the only surviving daughter of the deceased king, and along with the potential of a union with Norway and anti-German sentiments, Olaf II was elected as King of Denmark in 1376 with Queen Margaret as regent. With Albert III, Duke of Mecklenburg, Ingeborg's brother-in-law, on the Swedish throne, the Danish may not want another Mecklenburg ruler in Scandinavia. Ingeborg's grandson Eric of Pomerania inherited the rights of his grandmother and succeeded as King of Denmark in 1396 with Margaret as his regent.

Burrello, a songwriter and jazz pianist, and Murray started writing novelty songs after they were unsuccessful in having their more serious- minded songs recorded by prominent musicians. They noted the success of music that was seemingly intentionally bad, after hearing a disc jockey play Harry Stewart's version of\" Yes Sir, That's My Baby\" sung in Japanese and featuring a geisha orchestra. According to Murray, the disc jockey said that the record was one of the top hits but also\" one of the most horrible records he had ever heard\". Burrello and Murray responded by creating the songs\" There's a New Sound\" performed by Burello and\" Fish\" sung by Leona Anderson, which they released as a single. The former song's lyrics consist of a single chorus repeated five times, each time at a higher pitch. The lyrics describe a\" new sound ... the strangest sound that you have ever heard\", which turns out to be\" the sound that's made by worms\". Burrello was credited as the artist on the single, which was released on Burrello and Murray's own record label, Horrible, as catalog numbers H 100( ten- inch 78 rpm format) and H 100- X45( seven- inch 45 rpm format). It was the Horrible label's first and only release. When\" Billboard\" magazine reviewed the single, it commented,\" A weird one. ' The new sound is the sound made by worms.' Strange sound effects go with nonsense lyric. It's a studied attempt to be as screwy as possible. Quien Sabe?\" For the flip side,\" FishBillboard\" \u2032s review was\" Same comment\". Burrello and Murray originally had only 500 copies of\" There's a New SoundFish\" issued, to be sent to disc jockeys as a protest record. However, within two weeks, they received orders for more than 100,000 copies of the single. Soon afterward, Burrello and Murray were called upon to write a song for Brucie Weil, who was then 6 years old. The song they wrote for Weil,\" God Bless Us All\", reached# 18 on the\" Billboard\" singles chart. Burrello and Murray were soon called upon to write music for other artists, including a theme song for John Conte and special material for Tony Bennett. Anderson went on to exploit her newfound fame as a\" horrible\" musician( the schtick was a parody of opera singers who, in Anderson's opinion, could never\" kid themselves properly( or) let their voices go\") by making appearances on\" The Ernie Kovacs Show\" and recording a full- length album,\" Music to Suffer By\", in the same style she used for\" Fish.\" \" There's a New Sound\" was later featured often on the Dr. Demento show and performed by Scooter on\" The Muppet Show\".\nDocument[2](Title: Hood of the Living Dead) Hood of the Living Dead is a 2005 direct- to- video zombie movie about a regenerative formula bringing the dead back to life.\nDocument[3](Title: Ian Keith) Ian Keith( born Keith Ross, February 27, 1899 \u2013 March 26, 1960) was an American actor.\n\nQuestion: Which film came out first, Ami Neta Hobo or Hood Of The Living Dead?": [

Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as On Monsieur's Departure at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method.

Oxford was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom, a court favourite for a time, a sought-after patron of the arts, and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and court playwright, but his volatile temperament precluded him from attaining any courtly or governmental responsibility and contributed to the dissipation of his estate. Since the 1920s he has been among the most popular alternative candidates proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare's works. De Vere was the only son of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and Margery Golding. After the death of his father in 1562, he became a ward of Queen Elizabeth and was sent to live in the household of her principal advisor, Sir William Cecil. He married Cecil's daughter, Anne, with whom he had five children. De Vere was estranged from her for five years after he refused to acknowledge her first child as his. De Vere was a champion jouster and travelled widely throughout Italy and France. He was among the first to compose love poetry at the Elizabethan court, and he was praised as a playwright, though none of the plays known as his survive. A stream of dedications praised de Vere for his generous patronage of literary, religious, musical, and medical works, and he patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as musicians, tumblers, acrobats and performing animals. He fell out of favour with the Queen in the early 1580s and was exiled from court after impregnating one of her maids of honour, Anne Vavasour, which instigated violent street brawls between de Vere's retainers and her uncles. De Vere was reconciled to the Queen in 1583, but all opportunities for advancement had been lost. In 1586, the Queen granted de Vere a \u00a31,000 annuity to relieve his financial distress caused by his extravagance and selling off his income-producing lands for ready money. After his wife's death, he married Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen's maids of honour, with whom he had an heir, Henry de Vere.

The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by John Dalton in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven.

Herbert served as director of postal and telegraph censorship for the Ministry of Information during the Second World War. He was elected President of the Law Society in 1956. Knighted in 1943, Herbert was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire( KBE) in the 1956 Birthday Honours. He was created a life peer as Baron Tangley,\" of Blackheath in the County of Surrey\" on 22 January 1964. This was in recognition of his work on the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The area that was to become what is now known as Greater London was controlled by the London, Surrey, Essex, Kent and Middlesex County Councils and a number of County Boroughs. The result was that the London and Middlesex County Councils and County Boroughs disappeared, and the areas covered by Essex and Surrey were reduced. The Greater London Council was established as the strategic authority, with broad town planning and transport powers; below it were the City of London, basically covering the area it had always controlled, and thirty two new London Boroughs. They provided local town planning powers, local highways and inter alia social and housing powers. The GLC took over running the council housing that the London County Council had controlled.

HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Brad Ellis) Brad Ellis is an American composer, musical director, singer, orchestrator, and jazz pianist. Ellis is perhaps most visible as the quiet teacher/pianist for the high school kids on \"Glee\", the Fox television show for which he is part of creator Ryan Murphy's musical production team. Ellis grew up in the Boston area, attending Lexington High School. One of his teachers introduced him to the music program at Boston's Berklee College of Music, where Ellis would study music composition starting in the late 1970s, earning his degree between gigs over the next fifteen years. Ellis had a long association with the continuously evolving Off-Broadway satirical revue \" Forbidden Broadway'where he met his wife, comedienne Eydie Alyson. His Brad Ellis Little Big Band has released recordings, as produced by Bruce Kimmel. Ellis arranged, orchestrated and conducted members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for their 2006 album \"Unexpected Dreams: Songs from the Stars\", in support of the Philharmonic's \"Music Matters\" fund for music education. The album featured performances by TV and film stars including Victor Garber, Lucy Lawless, and Scarlett Johansson. In 2006 Ellis orchestrated and arranged the world premiere of Billy Joel's \"Waltz Variations no.2 op.5\", performed by Christoph Eschenbach and the Philadelphia Orchestra, for the 151st Anniversary Gala celebration of Philadelphia's Academy of Music. He created, with Jason Alexander, \"Seven Broadway Shows in 7 Minutes\". This witty medley was performed by Alexander with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, when the orchestra inducted its long-time conductor John Mauceri into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame in 2007. Ellis is the composer of the original music for the 2009 Off Broadway run of \"The Tin Pan Alley Rag\", which told the story of a fictional meeting between musical greats Scott Joplin and Irving Berlin. Ellis has composed or played piano for many TV shows and films, including \"Gilmore Girls\" (in the Season 5 episode \"Jews and Chinese Food\" the Season 7 episode \" Unto the Breach\"), and original ragtime cues Gilmore Girl \u2019s last episode of the last season. \"Close to HomeDelovely\" Bunheads, and the DVD special features for \"Beauty and the Beast. In 2009, Ellis joined the production team creating the new television series \"Glee\". Ellis joined the team as a musical director and vocal coach, but received additional duties as an on-screen, virtually non-speaking character providing piano accompaniment to the glee club. From the pilot episode, Ellis' name appears in the technical credits rather than the character credits of his on-screen episodes. The enigmatic role has led to Ellis being featured in interviews with \"People\" magazine, CNN.com, National Public Radio and Entertainment Weekly. In 2009, Ellis was part of the team that created the music and lyrics for the opening number for 81st Academy Awards telecast, as performed by Oscar host Hugh Jackman. The four main creators won the 2009 Emmy Award for Original Music and Lyrics for their work, while Ellis was bestowed a certificate of honor by the Emmy award's Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, in June 2010, for his contributions of original music and lyrics to the number. In 2011, Ellis worked with Robert Ulrich, casting director for \"Glee\", on the first special episode of \"The Glee Project\", coaching 80 potential candidates for the show. He was featured in the music segment of the special one-hour \"Audition Process\" episode that teased in the pilot of \"The Glee Project\". To the delight and surprise of many \"Glee\" fans, he spoke on the show. In July, 2013, Ellis was pianist for \"Glee\" star Matthew Morrison's run at the 54 Below nightclub in Manhattan. The show opened the same night that \"Glee\" co-star Cory Monteith died, so the two opened each subsequent show with the song \" What I Did For Love\", from \"A Chorus Line\", as a tribute to Monteith. Ellis continues to be the music director, orchestrator and arranger for Matthew Morrison as he tours performing with major symphony orchestras, and in cabaret venues throughout the world. He also serves as music director/orchestrator for Jane Lynch, when she performs her symphonic concerts as in her appearances with the Pittsburgh Symphony and Boston Pops. Ellis worked as a music director for The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again (2016) on FOX TV directed by Kenny Ortega. Also in 2016, he was honored to be invited back by Amy Sherman Pallidino and Dan Sherman to reprise his role as Brad, the piano player, on in the segment \"Summer\" featuring Sutton Foster, Christian Borle and Carole King.

He reigned jointly with his young son Diadumenianus. Macrinus was by origin a Berber from Mauretania Caesariensis. A member of the equestrian class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the senatorial class and was the first emperor from Mauretania. Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor Caracalla as a praetorian prefect and dealt with Rome's civil affairs. He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor. Macrinus was proclaimed emperor of Rome by 11 April 217 while in the eastern provinces of the empire and was subsequently confirmed as such by the Senate; however, for the duration of his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. His predecessor's policies had left Rome's coffers empty and the empire at war with several kingdoms, including Parthia, Armenia and Dacia. As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic stability to Rome. While Macrinus' diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military. Caracalla's aunt Julia Maesa took advantage of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, Elagabalus, recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in Chalcedon and later executed in Cappadocia. He sent his son to the care of Artabanus V of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.\nDocument[3](Title: Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6)) Marcus Aemilius Lepidus( c. 30 BC \u2013 33 AD) was a Roman senator, politician and general, praised by the historian Tacitus.\n\nQuestion: Who is Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Executed 39)'s father-in-law?": [

The term refers to reports of luminescent, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, the phenomenon lasts considerably longer than the split- second flash of a lightning bolt. Two reports from the nineteenth century say that the ball eventually explodes, leaving behind an odor of sulfur. The actual existence of lightning ball phenomena is not proven, but they appear in a variety of accounts over the centuries. Until the 1960s, most scientists treated reports of ball lightning skeptically, despite numerous accounts from around the world. Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear. Scientists have proposed many hypotheses about ball lightning over the centuries. Scientific data on natural ball- lightning remains scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence depends on reported public sightings, which have produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Owing to inconsistencies and to the lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning remains unknown. The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball- lightning event was published in January 2014, and included a video at high frame- rate.\nDocument[2](Title: Planet of the Apes) Planet of the Apes Created by Pierre Boulle Original work La Plan\u00e8te des singes (1963) Print publications Novel (s) La Plan\u00e8te des singes (1963) Comics List of comics Films and television Film (s) Original series Planet of the Apes (1968) Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) Remake Planet of the Apes (2001) Reboot series Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) Television series Planet of the Apes (1974) Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975 -- 1976) Games Video game (s) Planet of the Apes (2001) Revenge of the Apes (2003) Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier (2017)\nDocument[3](Title: Joseph ben Hayyim Hazan) Joseph ben \u1e24ayyim Hazan was a Sephardi \u1e25akham and chief rabbi of Jerusalem.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is the director of film Vortex (1976 Film)?": [

In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere.:4.2 Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.:18.2\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Bernhard Afinger or Melvin Kranzberg?": [

Taylor previously was a career officer in the United States Army, rose to the rank of major general and became a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican\u2013American War. As a result, he won election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union, but he died sixteen months into his term, before making any progress on the status of slavery, which had been inflaming tensions in Congress. Taylor was born into a prominent family of plantation owners who moved westward from Virginia to Louisville, Kentucky in his youth. He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812. He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832. His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname \"Old Rough and Ready\". In 1845, during the annexation of Texas, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande in anticipation of a battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas\u2013Mexico border. The Mexican\u2013American War broke out in April 1846, and Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and drove his troops out of Texas. Taylor then led his troops into Mexico, where they defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey. Defying orders, Taylor led his troops further south and, despite being severely outnumbered, dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna at the Battle of Buena Vista. Taylor's troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott, but Taylor retained his popularity. The Whig Party convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket in the 1848 presidential election, despite his unclear political tenets and lack of interest in politics. At the 1848 Whig National Convention, Taylor defeated Scott and former Senator Henry Clay to take the nomination. He won the general election alongside New York politician Millard Fillmore, defeating Democratic Party candidates Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler, as well as a third-party effort led by former president Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams, Sr. of the Free Soil Party. Taylor became the first president to be elected without having served in a prior political office. As president, Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet, even though partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery, and sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850. Taylor died suddenly of a stomach disease on July 9, 1850, with his administration having accomplished little aside from the ratification of the Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty. Fillmore served the remainder of his term. Historians and scholars have ranked Taylor in the bottom quartile of U.S. presidents, owing in part to his short term of office (16 months), and he has been described as \"more a forgettable president than a failed one.\"\nDocument[3](Title: Rudra Mohammad Shahidullah) Rudra Mohammad Shahidullah (16 October 1956 \u2013 21 June 1991) was a Bengali poet.

As the grain belt moved to the west, he moved with it, settling in Chicago in the 1850s and McGregor around 1860. Because of difficulties accessing steamboats to ship grain down the Mississippi River, he established the Diamond Jo line in 1866. It grew to become a major player in the transportation industry. He had its headquarters moved from Fulton, Illinois to Dubuque, Iowa in 1874. By the late 1870s railroads had taken over as the primary means of shipping grain, and Reynolds turned his attention to passenger boats.

It has subsequently housed grain trader offices, a billiard parlor, the post office, a winery, shops, and apartments. The building is a two- story brick Romanesque Revival structure.

Price graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1960, and went on to earn a dual degree in physics and engineering from Cornell University in 1965. He earned his Ph.D. in 1971 from Caltech under the supervision of Kip Thorne. He spent his career from 1971 to 2004 at the University of Utah, where he holds the title of Emeritus Professor. In 2004 he joined the Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy at the University of Texas at Brownsville. As of 2015 he became Senior Lecturer in physics at MIT. He is also on the adjunct faculty at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. In 2017, Price became the editor of the\" American Journal of Physics\". Price is probably best known for a 1972 result now known as Price's theorem. This is usually informally stated as follows:\" any inhomogeneities in the spacetime geometry outside a black hole will be radiated away\". ( Any such inhomogeneities can be quantified as nonzero higher multipole moments.) Price's theorem explains how the no hair theorem is enforced. Price also made pioneering numerical simulations which established( nonrigorously) a precise scenario for the emission of gravitational radiation during the merger of two compact objects( such as two black holes). Subsequent work has largely confirmed the scenario which was first developed in his work. These simulations have provided a major impetus for the development of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. He has done much in development of pedagogical techniques in physics at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc levels; a significant portion at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. He creates beautiful atlases of relativity. Price is the coauthor of three well known books in general relativity.

Following the release of the 1976 album, a film adaptation of the musical became mired in development hell for more than fifteen years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 1993, producer Robert Stigwood sold the rights to Andrew G.

After Stone stepped down from the project in 1994, Parker agreed to write and direct the film. Recording sessions for the songs and soundtrack took place at CTS Studios in London, England, roughly four months before filming. Parker worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber to compose the soundtrack, reworking the original songs by creating the music first and then the lyrics. They also wrote a new song,\" You Must Love Me\", for the film. Principal photography commenced in February 1996 with a budget of$ 55 million, and concluded in May of that year. Filming took place on locations in Buenos Aires and Budapest, and on soundstages at Shepperton Studios.

At one point the company also manufactured buses on its truck platforms. Ransom E. Olds was an entrepreneur who founded multiple companies in the automobile industry. In 1897 Olds founded the Olds Motor Vehicle Company, makers of Oldsmobile (later to become a part of General Motors). In 1905 Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Olds had 52 percent of the stock and the titles of president and general manager. To ensure a reliable supply of parts, he organized a number of subsidiary firms like the National Coil Company, the Michigan Screw Company, and the Atlas Drop Forge Company. Originally the company was to be called \"R. E. Olds Motor Car Company,\" but the owner of Olds' previous company, then called Olds Motor Works, objected and threatened legal action on the grounds of likely confusion of names by consumers. Olds then changed the name to his initials. Olds Motor Works soon adopted the popular name of its vehicles, Oldsmobile (which, along with Buick and Cadillac, became a founding division of General Motors Corporation). The company's name was spelled alternately in all capitals REO or with only an initial capital as Reo, and the company's own literature was inconsistent in this regard, with early advertising using all capitals and later advertising using the \"Reo\" capitalization. The pronunciation, however, was as a single word. Lansing is home to the R. E.

He was played by John Schneider. The name of\" Beauregard\" may have been chosen after the famous Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard. Bo and his cousin Lucas K.\" Luke\" Duke( Tom Wopat) live in an unincorporated area of the fictional Hazzard County, in Georgia. Bo and Luke own a 1969 Dodge Charger, named\" The General Lee\", which is painted orange, with the Confederate flag on top, and\" 01\" painted on the sides with the name\" General Lee\" inscribed above the doors that were welded shut for safety. Bo and Luke evade the corrupt officials of Hazzard County, Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane and usually end up putting an end to Hogg's latest crooked scheme. The Dukes( including cousin Daisy Duke and Uncle Jesse Duke) were well known for their role in the moonshine business among other interests. Bo and Luke had both been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine. As a result, neither was permitted to use firearms, instead preferring to use bow and arrows, which they sometimes tipped with dynamite. The terms of Bo and Luke's probation included staying within the boundaries of Hazzard County( unless given special permission by their Probation Officer, J.D. Hogg). Bo was the blonde, slightly younger of the two Duke boys, and the more impulsive one of the pair. He often reacted to situations on impulse without thinking, sometimes with an\" act/ speak now, think later\" attitude( although his character was seen to mature slightly over the seasons of the series). Although both Duke boys had a knack of landing themselves in trouble, it was more typically Bo's impulsive nature that often got them into various scrapes, and the slightly more mature Luke, the\" thinker\" of the duo, to find a solution. Bo's eye for the ladies and tendency to fall in love easily, also causes him to sometimes be easily led and affect his judgement and leads to trouble for the Dukes on a number of occasions( most prominently in the feature- length/ two- part story\" Carnival of Thrills\", produced at the end of the second season and broadcast at the start of the third). The character was nearly always seen wearing the same style of clothes, with a yellow shirt( with a blue T- shirt underneath for the first two seasons and some of third; this T- shirt is brown in the pilot episode), and light blue jeans. The exact hue of the shirt varied across the seasons- early on it was a deeper yellow; mid-run it was more of a cream color, and late examples saw it being more of a grey tone. The second episode produced and broadcast,\" Daisy's Song\", is notable for Bo instead wearing a red shirt for much of the story. A sequence in the fifth episode,\" High Octane\", sees Bo dressed in a light blue shirt, and many early publicity shots see the character dressed in a darker blue denim shirt. The character of Bo was best known for his rebel yell exclamation of the catchphrase, Yee- Haa!; cousin Luke sometimes also performed such a yell, but on a less regular basis. ( Actor Tom Wopat had trouble mastering the high- pitched yell early on, and in the opening credits and many examples within the episodes, it is actually a recording of John Schneider's version used twice to represent both Duke boys' yell). Most of the time, it was Bo who drove\" The General Lee\", with his cousin Luke riding shotgun( although these roles were swapped more regularly in later seasons); very early episodes suggested that the\" General\" belonged solely to Bo( Luke is said to have had a car that was wrecked very shortly before the start of the first episode,\" One Armed Bandits\"), but by mid-first season, it was more implied that both Bo and Luke owned the\" General Lee\" evenly between them. Bo was an ex-stock car driver( though he joined the Nascar Circuit for most of season 5 with his cousin Luke), and he was typically the one known for taking the\" General\" on most of its legendary jumps. Because its doors were welded shut, Bo and Luke always had to climb in and out of the car through the windows. Actors John Schneider and Tom Wopat have admitted that, on occasions that the roles were reversed and Luke drove, they found it much more difficult to climb in and out of the opposite window to which they were accustomed. Bo later left Hazzard County, along with his cousin Luke, to join the NASCAR circuit( coinciding with Schneider's and Wopat's decision to walk out of the show during the fifth season over a dispute over royalties owed to them), although how they managed to do this with the probation conditions in place was never revealed; Bo's cousin Coy( Byron Cherry), who was very similar in both appearance and nature to Bo, replaced Bo until he returned to the series a few months later. According to the 1997 film, Bo left Hazzard again to pursue a successful NASCAR career, this time without Luke. Shortly before his return to Hazzard, he crashed his car, and is still in Hazzard in the 2000 film. Although he was a lifelong bachelor, in the 2000 film, he met a woman named Gabrielle( nicknamed Gabby) in Los Angeles and convinced her to go to Hazzard to be with him.\nDocument[3](Title: Henri Am\u00e9d\u00e9e de Broglie) Henri Am\u00e9d\u00e9e de Broglie, Prince de Broglie( February 8, 1849- November 5, 1917).\n\nQuestion: Who is the father of Auguste-Th\u00e9odore-Paul De Broglie?": [

While there, he did some work with video, and a chance meeting with director Arne Bro encouraged him to pursue film as a career. Genz was then accepted into the National Film School of Denmark at the age of 31, graduating after completing the well-regarded short film \"Cross Roads\" (Danish title: Omveje, \"Detours\") in 1995.

Speaking later about his difficulty in trying to work under the Dogme restrictions, he described himself as a \"visual director\" and Dogme as a movement where \"the camera follows the [actors] and choice means nothing\". In 2003, Genz released his first feature film, an adaptation of the children's book \"Someone like Hodder\" (Danish title: \" En som Hodder\") by popular writer Bjarne Reuter. He followed it in 2005 with \"Chinaman\" (Danish title: \"Kinamand\"), a romantic comedy about a man who takes a foreign wife in an arranged marriage so that she can obtain permission for residency, and then falls in love with her.

Antionum also bordered on the seashore, apparently to the east of the land. The name Antionum was given the land by the Zoramites who gathered and settled the area. When Alma and his brethren went to the land to preach to the Zoramites they were surprised to find that the Zoramites had built synagogues and astonished at their unusual form of worship. Those who believed in the words of Alma and his missionary companions were cast out of the land and went north to the land of Jershon to live among the people of Ammon, the Lamanite converts. The Zoramites eventually allied with the Lamanites in an attempt to overthrow the Nephite government( as had done Amlici). The combined Zoramite/ Lamanite army gathered in the land Antionum as the Nephites gathered in the land of Jershon. In large part due to inferior defensive technology, the Lamanites were afraid to face the Nephites at that juncture, so they departed the land of Antionum into the wilderness, toward the land of Manti where a battle ensued.

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\nDocument[2](Title: Brooks Steam Motors) Brooks Steam Motors, Ltd. was a Canadian manufacturer of steam cars established in March 1923.

The Bible records only that Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron and a cousin (or relative) of Mary. The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 8th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows: There were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ. The 19th-century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions (which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.\nDocument[2](Title: Julia Stowers) Julia Gray Stowers (born March 18, 1982) is an American former competition swimmer and Olympic gold medalist.

    "Documents:\nDocument[1](Title: Heinrich Sahm) Heinrich Friedrich Wilhelm Martin Sahm (12 September 1877 \u2013 3 October 1939) was a German lawyer, mayor and statesman from the Free City of Danzig. Sahm was born in Anklam, present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and educated as a lawyer, in 1906 he became a member of the Magdeburg city council and served from 1912 to 1919 as a deputy mayor of Bochum. In the meantime he also worked in the government of occupied Warsaw during World War I. In 1919 he was elected mayor of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), a city that had formerly belonged to the German Empire. In the same year Danzig and the surrounding territory was to be severed from Germany and turned into a city-state according to the Versailles treaty. After the establishment of the Free City of Danzig in 1920, Sahm became first President of the Senate, the de facto head of state beneath the High Commissioner of the League of Nations. Sahm protested against the take-over of the sea resort town (Ostseebad) Westerplatte by the League of Nations and Poland's establishment of a military transport depot. He held the office until 1931, re-elected two times. While Poland was in charge for Danzig's foreign affairs, citizens had to take on a separate \"Danzig\" citizenship or, if they wanted to retain their German citizenship, had to move out of the territory. Sahm politics aimed to strengthen the Free City's ties to the Weimar Republic and to ward off Polish claims; nevertheless the relations with Poland intermittently improved after the implementation of a customs union and the institution of the Danzig gulden in 1923, which protected Danzig from the hyperinflation in Germany. A nonpartisan, he proceeded tactically along party lines, which caused several difficulties in his government and finally led to his overthrow by the Danzig German National People's Party. In 1931 he became mayor of Berlin, a position he held even after the government takeover of the Nazi Party in 1933, though actually disempowered by the appointment of state commissioner Julius Lippert. Sahm joined the Nazi party in November 1933. He resigned in 1935 and was appointed a German envoy to Norway one year later. Sahm died in Oslo. He is buried at the Waldfriedhof Dahlem in Berlin.\nDocument[2](Title: Quenuaorco) Quenuaorco( possibly from Quechua\" kinwa\" quinoa,\" urqu\" mountain,\" quinoa mountain\") is a mountain in the northwestern part of the Vilcabamba mountain range in the Andes of Peru, about high.

He was born in Vienna, where he received a doctorate having studied medicine. After becoming a leading journalist for the SPD, he participated in the November Revolution in Germany and was Finance Minister of Germany in 1923 and from 1928 to 1929. In 1933 he fled into exile, living in Zurich and then Paris, where he died in custody of the Gestapo in 1941. Hilferding was a proponent of the \"economic\" reading of Karl Marx identifying with the \"Austro-Marxian\" group. He was the first to put forward the theory of \"organized capitalism\". He was the main defender of Marxism from critiques by Austrian School economist and fellow Vienna resident Eugen Boehm von Bawerk. Hilferding also participated in the \"Crises Debate\" \u2013 disputing Marx's theory of the instability and eventual breakdown of capitalism on the basis that the concentration of capital is actually stabilizing. He edited leading publications such as \"Vorw\u00e4rtsDie Freiheit\", and \"Die Gesellschaft\". His most famous work was \"Das FinanzkapitalFinance capital\"), one of the most influential and original contributions to Marxist economics with substantial influence on Marxist writers such as Vladimir Lenin and Nikolai Bukharin influencing his writings on imperialism.\n\nQuestion: Are Hopen Church and Spind Church located in the same country?": [
