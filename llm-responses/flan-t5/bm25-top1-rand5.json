His reign was from 1803 to 1821 and 1842 to 1845. He was appointed as Heir Apparent(\" Uparaja\") by the King of Siam and invested with the title of\" Chao Pangeran\" in 1799. He succeeded on the forced abdication of his paternal uncle in September 1803. He had been recognised as ruler of Kedah by the King of Siam, and installed at the Balai Besar, Kota Star Palace, Alor Star, with the title of\" Phaya Ratna Sangrama Ramabhakti Sri Sultan Muhammad Ratna Raja Varman\" on 19 September 1804. He was promoted to the rank of\" Chao Phya Ratna Sangrama Ramabhakti Sri Sultan Muhammad Ratna Raja \u201c Bodin Tersurin Terwerei \u201d Varman Chao Phya Seraipuri\" on 2 August 1811. On hearing about a planned invasion of Siam by Burma in 1820, he refused to dispatch the annual Bunga Mas tribute to Bangkok and opened negotiations for a Burmese alliance. The Governor of Ligor then invaded the state on 12 November 1821, and conquered Kedah Fort on the 18th of the same month. The Sultan fled to British territory, the Governor of Ligor appointing his son as acting Governor. The British authorities granted the Sultan asylum and a pension, allowing him to live in exile, first at Penang, and later at Malacca. After several failed attempts at regaining his throne by force of arms, he sent his sons to Bangkok to negotiate his restoration in 1842. The Siamese had divided Kedah into four petty states in 1841, from which they offered him the southern, largest and most prosperous portion. He agreed to this offer and was permitted to return as nominal ruler over the much reduced realm in June 1842. He expanded his territory by seizing Krian from Perak on 20 December 1842. He established his capital at Kota Kuala Muda as Alor Star was overgrown with forest and vegetation. The Sultan's reign was marked by Siamese rule where its army invaded and occupied Kedah between 1821 and 1842. Local Kedahan Arab families supported the Sultan's efforts to lead resistance efforts against Siamese rule. Arab leaders employed a two- pronged approach of religious militancy and diplomacy to free Kedah from Siamese rule, among which the Jamallulail family played a leading role in these efforts and often carried out negotiations to persuade the Siamese to regain the state's independence. The Siamese later agreed to restore the Sultan of Kedah to his throne in 1842. The following year, Syed Hussein Jamallulail was installed as the first Raja of Perlis, after Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin gave his endorsement for the formation of Perlis state.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?": [

In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 US study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?": [

His ancestry is not known for certain. Onomastics would place him in the extended family of Odo I, Count of Orl\u00e9ans. The most recent studies make him a son of Robert, Count of Oberrheingau and Wormsgau, and Waldrada, a daughter of Odo of Orl\u00e9ans. If this theory is true, he was the elder brother of Robert the Strong. Like the rest of his family, he was a loyal follower of Charles the Bald. Though well- endowed with estates in Austrasia, like his brother Robert, he abandoned these after the Treaty of Verdun( 843) in order to rejoin Charles the Bald. In 846, he was granted lands in the region of Ch\u00e2teaudun, made Count of Anjou, and wed to Wandilmodis. In 852, after the death of Aleran, Count of Troyes, he was nominated to hold his vacant office and his brother Robert succeeded him in Anjou. In 853, he participated in the Capitulary of Servais as\" missi\" in conjunction with Bishop Wenilo of Sens. In 858, Charles named his son Louis the Stammerer to the\" ducatus Cenomannicus\" and Robert, angered by his loss of influence there, revolted and called in the aid of Louis the German. Odo soon joined him. The brothers were subsequently expelled from their counties and Troyes confiscated and confided to one Rudolph. Odo may have recovered Troyes after Rudolph's death( 866), but perhaps not. In any case, his brother made his submission in 861 and was given the March of Neustria.

Eisenhower) French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign, and Eisenhower encountered a \"preposterous situation\" with the multiple rival factions in France. His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to Fran\u00e7ois Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. The Allied leaders were \"thunderstruck\" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move. Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle. Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies, considering it a criminal rather than a military matter. Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution.\nDocument[4](Title: England Swings) \"England Swings (Like a Pendulum Do)\" is a 1965 country music song written and performed by Roger Miller.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film And The Spring Comes?": [

The film was screened at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but did not enter the main competition.\nDocument[5](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Honor to Us All) \"Honor to Us All\" is a song written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel for Walt Disney Pictures' 36th animated feature film \"Mulan\" (1998). Recorded by singers Beth Fowler, Marni Nixon and Lea Salonga, the latter two of whom provide the singing voices of Grandmother Fa and Fa Mulan, respectively, the song is a character number performed by several older Chinese women and female members of Mulan's family as they prepare the main character to be evaluated by the Matchmaker in the scene towards the beginning of the film. Songwriter Stephen Schwartz was originally enlisted to write the songs for \"Mulan\", and had written a song called \"China Doll\" intended for the scene in which Mulan prepares to meet the Matchmaker. After the songwriter resigned from \"Mulan\" in favor of writing songs for rival studio DreamWorks' \" The Prince of Egypt\" (1998) , Schwartz was ultimately replaced with Wilder and Zippel, who wrote \"Honor to Us All\" with which to replace \"China Doll\". Nixon's casting as Grandmother Fa's singing voice ultimately influenced Disney to recast the voice actress who had originally been hired to supply Grandmother Fa's speaking voice with actress June Foray due to closer similarities between Nixon's and Foray's voices. Intended to be ironic, \"Honor to Us All\" features lyrics that instruct Mulan on how to become an ideal bride by emphasizing her physical appearance, remaining obedient to her prospective husband and eventually bearing children. Parodying traditional gender roles and cultural expectations of women, \"Honor to Us All\" has been identified as an East Asian-influenced song that heavily incorporates Asian instrumentation, more-so than any other musical number in the film. The song's use of pentatonic scales and Chinese flutes also help establish the film's setting, as does referencing the Chinese tradition of praying to one's ancestors. \"Honor to Us All\" has received mixed reviews from film and music critics, who were divided over both the song's quality and intended message.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Who...?": [

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\nDocument[5](Title: Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury) Adolfo M\u00fcller- Ury, KSG( March 29, 1862 \u2013 July 6, 1947) was a Swiss- born American portrait painter and impressionistic painter of roses and still life.\nDocument[6](Title: Judge Hardy's Children) Judge Hardy's Children is a 1938 film in the Andy Hardy series.

The title refers to the Caron perfume\" Narcisse noir\". Based on the 1939 novel by Rumer Godden, the film revolves around the growing tensions within a small convent of Anglican nuns who are trying to establish a school and hospital in an old palace on an isolated mountain above a fertile valley in the Himalayas. Although some of the publicity makes it sound as if the nuns all fall in love with the same man and compete for his affections, the truth is much more complicated. One mentally ill sister does harbor a grand\u2014and ultimately fatal\u2014passion for the handsome libertine British expatriate who is agent for the local potentate, but he is completely unaware of her feelings until the end of the film. Her paranoid delusions embrace everyone around her and she becomes insanely jealous of one sister. In fact, the greatest challenges to the nuns \u2019 work come from the place itself and the unfamiliar people they have come to serve. \" Black Narcissus\" achieved acclaim for its pioneering technical mastery with the cinematographer, Jack Cardiff, shooting in vibrant colour, winning an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography, and Alfred Junge winning an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. According to film critic David Thomson, Black Narcissus\" is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns, startling whenever Kathleen Byron is involved\".\nDocument[5](Title: Qeshlaq-e Farajollah Hajj Sarkhan) Qeshlaq -e Farajollah Hajj Sarkhan( also Romanized as Qeshl\u0101q -e Farajollah \u1e28\u0101jj S\u0101rkh\u0101n) is a village in Qeshlaq -e Gharbi Rural District, Aslan Duz District, Parsabad County, Ardabil Province, Iran.

The battle saw three top leaders of the Umayyad clan (Utba ibn Rabi'ah, Walid ibn Utbah and Shaybah) killed by Hashimites (Ali, Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith) in a three-on-three melee. This fueled the opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the grandson of Umayya, to Muhammad and to Islam. Abu Sufyan sought to exterminate the adherents of the new religion by waging another battle with Muslims based in Medina only a year after the Battle of Badr. He did this to avenge the defeat at Badr. The Battle of Uhud is generally believed by scholars to be the first defeat for the Muslims, as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans. After the battle, Abu Sufyan's wife Hind, who was also the daughter of Utba ibn Rabi'ah, is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Within five years after his defeat in the Battle of Uhud, however, Muhammad took control of Mecca and announced a general amnesty for all. Abu Sufyan and his wife Hind embraced Islam on the eve of the conquest of Mecca, as did their son (the future caliph Muawiyah I).\n\nQuestion: Are both Nikolsk Airport and Svobodny Airport located in the same country?": [

As the first non-Frankish king of East Francia, he established the Ottonian dynasty of kings and emperors, and he is generally considered to be the founder of the medieval German state, known until then as East Francia. An avid hunter, he obtained the epithet\" the Fowler\" because he was allegedly fixing his birding nets when messengers arrived to inform him that he was to be king. He was born into the Liudolfing line of Saxon dukes. His father Otto I of Saxony died in 912 and was succeeded by Henry. The new duke launched a rebellion against the king of East Francia, Conrad I of Germany, over the rights to lands in the Duchy of Thuringia. They reconciled in 915 and on his deathbed in 918, Conrad recommended Henry as the next king, considering the duke the only one who could hold the kingdom together in the face of internal revolts and external Magyar raids. Henry was elected and crowned king in 919. He went on to defeat the rebellious dukes of Bavaria and Swabia, consolidating his rule. Through successful warfare and a dynastic marriage, Henry acquired Lotharingia as a vassal in 925. Unlike his Carolingian predecessors, Henry did not seek to create a centralized monarchy, ruling through federated autonomous stem duchies instead. Henry built an extensive system of fortifications and mobile heavy cavalry across Germany to neutralize the Magyar threat and in 933 routed them at the Battle of Riade, ending Magyar attacks for the next 21 years and giving rise to a sense of German nationhood. Henry greatly expanded German hegemony in Europe with his defeat of the Slavs in 929 at the Battle of Lenzen along the Elbe river, by compelling the submission of Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia through an invasion of the Duchy of Bohemia the same year and by conquering Danish realms in Schleswig in 934. Henry's hegemonic status north of the Alps was acknowledged by King Rudolph of West Francia and King Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy, who both accepted a place of subordination as allies in 935. Henry planned an expedition to Rome to be crowned emperor by the pope, but the design was thwarted by his death. Henry prevented a collapse of royal power, as had happened in West Francia, and left a much stronger kingdom to his successor Otto I. He was buried at Quedlinburg Abbey, established by his wife Matilda in his honor.\nDocument[5](Title: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (often shortened to TMNT or Ninja Turtles) are four fictional teenaged anthropomorphic turtles named after Renaissance Italian artists.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Lucky Dog (film)) Lucky Dog is a 1933 American drama film directed by Zion Myers and written by Zion Myers and Roland Asher.

There is no universal consensus among Mormon scholars regarding the placement of these locations in the known world, other than somewhere in the Americas. A popular\" traditional\" view among many Latter- day Saint faithful covers much of North and South America; while many Book of Mormon scholars, particularly in recent decades, believe the text itself favors a limited Mesoamerican or other limited setting for most of the Book of Mormon events. The largest of the churches embracing the Book of Mormon \u2014 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints( LDS Church) \u2014has not endorsed an official position for the geographical setting the Book of Mormon, although some of its leaders have spoken of various possible locations over the years. There have also been multiple attempts to identify the several civilizations in the Book of Mormon, which are dated in the text as living from 2500 BC to 400 AD, but no consensus has ever been reached. According to Joseph Smith, an angel named Moroni told him\" there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.\" According to Joseph Smith, Moroni explained that the coming forth of the Book of Mormon was to be concurrent with the fulfillment of ancient prophecies regarding the latter- day church of Christ. According to Latter Day Saint scripture, the narrative in the Book of Mormon came to an end in the ancient land Cumorah, where Moroni, in 421 AD deposited the golden plates prior to his death. Mormon and Moroni's Cumorah is claimed by many believers to be the same land containing the modern\" Hill Cumorah\" near Joseph Smith's home in Palmyra, western New York, from whence the gold plates of the Book of Mormon were retrieved. Others view the modern\" Hill Cumorah\" to be distinct from the original, and simply to have been named after it; thus adding no information to the question of the location of the lands described in the Book of Mormon.\nDocument[6](Title: Wisconsin State Fair) The first Wisconsin State Fair was held in 1851 in Janesville, with approximately 13,000 to 18,000 people in attendance.

A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: New Brunswick Museum) The New Brunswick Museum, located in Saint John, New Brunswick, is Canada's oldest continuing museum.

The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.

It was first presented at the 1999 SEMA Show. It is essentially a redesigned Prowler which addressed some of the complaints and problems existing Prowler owners had. The lack of cargo space in the Prowler was universally lamented, so the Howler addressed this by elongating and squaring off the back end, creating a moderate sized trunk. The Prowler was only available as a 3.5 L V6 that was rated at~ 250 hp at its highest. For what was considered to be a modern\" hot rod\", this was not considered to be enough power, so the Howler was given a 4.7L V8- which had nearly the same horsepower, but had significantly more torque. The engine is mated to a five speed manual transmission, instead of the Prowler's four speed automatic. This freed up some room in the undercarriage to enlarge the gas tank for the thirstier V8. The Howler also has a removable hardtop instead of the traditional ragtop of the Prowler. The top is manually removed, and can be stored in a compartment behind the seats. Though the concept was appreciated by most Prowler enthusiasts, the low sales volume of the Prowler and the ultimate demise of the Plymouth nameplate ensured that the Howler was never made into a production vehicle.\nDocument[2](Title: Domestic Relations) Domestic Relations is a 1957 short story collection by Frank O'Connor.\nDocument[3](Title: Clouds (film)) Clouds is a 2000 film written and directed by Don Thompson and produced by Will Arntz.\nDocument[4](Title: Dilan 1991) Dilan 1991 is a 2019 Indonesian teen romantic drama film.

Oxford was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom, a court favourite for a time, a sought-after patron of the arts, and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and court playwright, but his volatile temperament precluded him from attaining any courtly or governmental responsibility and contributed to the dissipation of his estate. Since the 1920s he has been among the most popular alternative candidates proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare's works. De Vere was the only son of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and Margery Golding. After the death of his father in 1562, he became a ward of Queen Elizabeth and was sent to live in the household of her principal advisor, Sir William Cecil. He married Cecil's daughter, Anne, with whom he had five children. De Vere was estranged from her for five years after he refused to acknowledge her first child as his. De Vere was a champion jouster and travelled widely throughout Italy and France. He was among the first to compose love poetry at the Elizabethan court, and he was praised as a playwright, though none of the plays known as his survive. A stream of dedications praised de Vere for his generous patronage of literary, religious, musical, and medical works, and he patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as musicians, tumblers, acrobats and performing animals. He fell out of favour with the Queen in the early 1580s and was exiled from court after impregnating one of her maids of honour, Anne Vavasour, which instigated violent street brawls between de Vere's retainers and her uncles. De Vere was reconciled to the Queen in 1583, but all opportunities for advancement had been lost. In 1586, the Queen granted de Vere a \u00a31,000 annuity to relieve his financial distress caused by his extravagance and selling off his income-producing lands for ready money. After his wife's death, he married Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen's maids of honour, with whom he had an heir, Henry de Vere. He died in 1604, having spent the entirety of his inherited estates.\nDocument[2](Title: Clifford Henry Fitzherbert Plowman) Clifford Henry Fitzherbert Plowman CMG OBE BA JP (23 July 1889 - 25 October 1948) was a British diplomat and Colonial Service administrator.

It became an Air Force base in 1951 with the mission of training Air Force engineers. Camp Wolters was the location where two of the war's most famous enlisted infantrymen underwent basic training- Audie Murphy and Eddie Slovik. Audie Murphy completed basic training at Camp Wolters. He was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of World War II, receiving every military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. At the age of 19, Murphy received the Medal of Honor after single- handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Mosaic) In the 5th-century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art.

The film follows a Union soldier- turned- drifter and his companion, a mixed- race prostitute, who become embroiled in a bitter, destructive feud between a gang of Confederate Red Shirts and a band of Mexican revolutionaries. Intended to capitalize on and rival the success of Sergio Leone's\" A Fistful of Dollars\", Corbucci's film is, like Leone's, considered to be a loose, unofficial adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's\" Yojimbo\". The film earned a reputation as one of the most violent films ever made at the time, and was subsequently refused a certificate in the United Kingdom until 1993, when it was issued an 18 certificate( the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004). A commercial success upon release,\" Django\" has garnered a large cult following outside of Italy and is widely regarded as one of the best films of the Spaghetti Western genre, with the direction, Nero's performance, and Luis Bacalov's soundtrack most frequently being praised. Although the name is referenced in over thirty\" sequels\" from the time of the film's release until the early 1970s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, most of these films were unofficial, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero reprised his role as Django in 1987's\" Django Strikes Again\", the only official sequel produced with Corbucci's involvement. Nero also made a cameo appearance in Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film\" Django Unchained\", as homage to Corbucci's original.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[5](Title: Iv\u00e1n T.

Pine trees cover its base, and at its two peaks are the 19th century Chapel of St. George, a theatre, and a restaurant. The name also refers to the residential neighbourhood immediately below the east of the hill. The hill is a tourist destination and can be ascended by the Lycabettus Funicular, a funicular railway which climbs the hill from a lower terminus at Kolonaki( The railway station can be found at Aristippou street). Lycabettus appears in various legends. Popular stories suggest it was once the refuge of wolves,( lycos in Greek), which is possibly the origin of its name( means\" the one[ the hill] that is walked by wolves\"). Another etymology suggests a Pelasgian, pre-Mycenean, origin(\" Lucabetu=mastoid hill\"). Mythologically, Lycabettus is credited to Athena, who created it when she dropped a limestone mountain she had been carrying from the Pallene peninsula for the construction of the Acropolis after the box holding Erichthonius was opened.\nDocument[2](Title: Amasa Walker) Amasa Walker( May 4, 1799 \u2013 October 29, 1875) was an American economist and United States Representative, and the father of Francis Amasa Walker.\nDocument[3](Title: Piano Sonata in A minor, D 784 (Schubert)) Franz Schubert's Piano Sonata in A minor, D 784 (posthumously published as Op. 143), is one of Schubert's major compositions for the piano. Schubert composed the work in February 1823, perhaps as a response to his illness the year before. It was however not published until 1839, eleven years after his death. It was given the opus number 143 and a dedication to Felix Mendelssohn by its publishers. The D 784 sonata, Schubert's last to be in three movements, is seen by many to herald a new era in Schubert's output for the piano, and to be a profound and sometimes almost obsessively tragic work.\nDocument[4](Title: Mohamed Ould Khalifa) Mohamed Ould Khalifa( born 6 May 1968) is a Mauritanian long- distance runner.

Since forming in 1993 as Thundercross, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, and a Live DVD. Rhapsody of Fire is known for its conceptual lyrics that constitute a fantasy story throughout all of their albums from 1997 to 2011. After using the moniker of Rhapsody for nearly ten years, the band changed their name to Rhapsody of Fire in 2006 due to trademark issues. In 2011, following the release of their album\" From Chaos to Eternity\" which concluded The Dark Secret Saga, and after 18 years as co-leader of the band, Turilli left Rhapsody of Fire( on good terms) to form a new Rhapsody band, Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, along with two other members who left with him, Dominique Leurquin, Patrice Guers. They describe their discography as a parallel continuation of Rhapsody of Fire's discography, with their first album being their own\" Rhapsody's 11th album\" and consider that they did n't leave the band, rather that it amicably split in two. In 2016, other long- term members Fabio Lione and Alex Holzwarth had left the band, and reunited with Turilli, Leurquin and Guers, to play again under the name Rhapsody for their 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour; in December 2018, several months after announcing that Luca Turilli's Rhapsody was now inactive, Turilli announced the creation of a new Rhapsody band named Turilli/ Lione Rhapsody, with the lineup of the 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour( recreating, minus Staropoli, the original band's 2002- 2011 lineup).\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Joe Palooka In Fighting Mad or Figaro-Ci, Figaro-L\u00e0?": [

Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sassanians and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held \"de facto\" power throughout his reign. In 270, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to southern Egypt, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to Roman emperor Aurelian's campaign in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress (declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome). The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life. Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.\n\nQuestion: Do both films: Gammat Jammat and Ready (2011 Film) have the directors from the same country?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[5](Title: Let's Be Friends (disambiguation)) Let's Be Friends is a 1969 album by Elvis Presley. \" Let's Be Friends\" can also refer to:\nDocument[6](Title: Gordeh, Fars) Gordeh( also known as Ard\u0101l, Qal\u2018eh Gerdeh, and Qal \u2019eh- ye Gordeh) is a village in Runiz Rural District, Runiz District, Estahban County, Fars Province, Iran.

The term refers to reports of luminescent, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, the phenomenon lasts considerably longer than the split- second flash of a lightning bolt. Two reports from the nineteenth century say that the ball eventually explodes, leaving behind an odor of sulfur. The actual existence of lightning ball phenomena is not proven, but they appear in a variety of accounts over the centuries. Until the 1960s, most scientists treated reports of ball lightning skeptically, despite numerous accounts from around the world. Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear. Scientists have proposed many hypotheses about ball lightning over the centuries. Scientific data on natural ball- lightning remains scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence depends on reported public sightings, which have produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Owing to inconsistencies and to the lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning remains unknown. The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball- lightning event was published in January 2014, and included a video at high frame- rate.\nDocument[2](Title: T. H.

Continental cuisine can be found in selected places. International chain restaurants are rare, but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there. It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins\nDocument[5](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Naciye Han\u0131m) Naciye Han\u0131m( born Zeliha Ankuap; 1882 \u2013 4 December 1924) was the thirteenth, and last wife of Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Samir Rifai's father?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal) The Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal published by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the American Association of Family & Consumer Sciences.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Anne de Gaulle) In October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur at Milon-la-Chapelle (Yvelines), where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the \"Fondation Anne de Gaulle\".\nDocument[4](Title: Unseen Evil) Unseen Evil is a 2001 supernatural horror film directed by Jay Woelfel.

He is credited with contributing to the spread of the Internet into Japan and the rest of Asia in the 1990s and was a pivotal figure in the early commercial development of the Internet. For this reason, he is often called the \"Mother of the Internet\" in Japan. Takahashi was born in Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture in 1941. After graduating from the Faculty of Arts at Tohoku University in 1964, he worked as a contributing editor and writer. Since 1982, he has been involved in marketing of Videotex.

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.\nDocument[4](Title: Watskeburt?!)

Popular as a dance band, the Tucker orchestra played concert halls, theatres, hotels and various venues across the country \u2014 for a span of 25 years. Recorded for Okeh in June 1941, his biggest hit,\" I Do n't Want to Set the World on Fire\", achieved status as a Gold Record.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[5](Title: Fjeldeventyret) Fjeldeventyret( The Mountain Story) is a Norwegian film from 1927 based on Henrik Anker Bjerregaard's play of the same name from 1824.

Originally, Subway Academy I was simply called \"Subway Academy\", but after Subway Academy II opened, the name was changed to \"Subway Academy I\". It was founded in September 1973, making it one of the oldest secondary alternative schools in Toronto. The original staff were Achim Krull, Judith Robertson and Murray Shukyn. The school was a reflection of the Ivan Illich \"deschooling\" movement, which proposed that people would learn best from community resources. As a result, a directory of resources along the Toronto subway system was created, and the school derives its name from that initiative. The community resource aspect of the program however faded very quickly. Students were more interested in formal credit courses and academic courses leading to admission to university or college admission. Subway Academy started as an independent studies program. It was intended to make education available to students with family or other obligations which limited their ability to attend school during regular hours and who could not attend night school. The school enrolled students at any time during the year, not just in September. Originally, there was no upper age limit on enrolment. The school attracted many adults. The independent studies program at Subway Academy operated very differently from regular high school programs. Students met their teachers by appointment several times a week, but there were no formal classes. During the appointments, students reviewed their progress with their teachers, wrote tests, handed in assignments, and received new work. Students could work at the school, or at home, or at the local library, wherever they were comfortable. Students started courses when they joined, and finished courses whenever they had completed all the required work. Additional courses could be started at any time. Today Subway Academy combined formal classes with independent studies, and students are required to complete courses during a regular semestered timeframe. Subway Academy One continues to share a building with Eastern Commerce Collegiate Institute. Today it offers courses from grades 9 to 12 at both the academic and applied level. As the enrolment at Subway Academy increased, it was divided into two branches. Subway Academy II was opened in the west end of Toronto. Judith Robertson became the first coordinator of that program. It continues today as an independent studies program.\nDocument[5](Title: Leslie Shows) Leslie Shows( born 1977) is an American artist who is recognized for expanding the boundaries of landscape painting.\nDocument[6](Title: Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte, 5th Prince of Canino) Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte, 5th Prince of Canino and Musignano( Napol\u00e9on Charles Gr\u00e9goire Jacques Philippe Bonaparte; 5 February 1839 \u2013 11 February 1899), was born in Rome as the son of Charles Lucien Bonaparte and his wife, Z\u00e9na\u00efde Bonaparte.\n\nQuestion: When is Prince Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's father's birthday?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Hunter (Bj\u00f6rk Song)?": [

As a young man, he spent six years in exile working closely with fellow exiles Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. After the revolution of February 1917, he returned to Moscow, where his Bolshevik credentials earned him a high rank in the Bolshevik party and after the October Revolution became editor of the party newspaper \"Pravda.\" Within the Bolshevik Party, Bukharin was initially a left communist, but gradually moved from the left to the right from 1921. His strong support for and defence of the New Economic Policy (NEP) eventually saw him lead the Right Opposition. By late 1924, this stance had positioned Bukharin favourably as Joseph Stalin's chief ally, with Bukharin soon elaborating Stalin's new theory and policy of socialism in one country. Together, Bukharin and Stalin ousted Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev from the party at the XVth Communist Party Congress in December 1927. From 1926 to 1929, Bukharin enjoyed great power as General Secretary of the Comintern's executive committee. However, Stalin's decision to proceed with collectivisation drove the two men apart and Bukharin was expelled from the Politburo in 1929. When the Great Purge began in 1936, Stalin looked for any pretext to liquidate his former allies and rivals for power and some of Bukharin's letters, conversations and tapped phone-calls indicated disloyalty. Arrested in February 1937, he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. After a show trial that alienated many Western communist sympathisers, he was executed in March 1938.\nDocument[6](Title: Ashkenazi Jews) With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \"usurious\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Augustus William, Duke Of Brunswick-Bevern born?": [

Some scholars have placed his work in the 3rd century BC, though the evidence of the date is not definitive. His only known work,\" Exag\u014dg\u0113\", is the earliest known Jewish play. It survives only in fragments found in the writings of Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria, and Pseudo- Eustathius. Nevertheless, the extensive quotations by these writers make possible the assembly of 269 lines of text, about 20- 25% of the whole. The only more extensive remnant of the Greco- Jewish poets is that found in the Sibylline Oracles. \" Exag\u014dg\u0113\" is a five- act drama written in iambic trimeter, retelling of the biblical story of The Exodus from Egypt. Moses is the main character of the play, and parts of the biblical story have been altered to suit the narrative's needs. These changes probably point to Ezekiel's intention to stage the play, since certain scenes that are impossible to stage were converted into monologue. This drama is unique in blending the biblical story with the Hellenistic tragic drama. The main modern edition is a parallel- text English- Greek edition by classical scholar Howard Jacobson.\nDocument[5](Title: Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg) Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (Victoria Eugenie Julia Ena; 24 October 1887 \u2013 15 April 1969) was Queen of Spain as the wife of King Alfonso XIII.\nDocument[6](Title: Father's Day (United States)) A bill to accord national recognition of the holiday was introduced in Congress in 1913.

US President Calvin Coolidge recommended in 1924 that the day be observed by the nation, but stopped short of issuing a national proclamation. Two earlier attempts to formally recognize the holiday had been defeated by Congress. In 1957, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith wrote a proposal accusing Congress of ignoring fathers for 40 years while honoring mothers, thus ``(singling) out just one of our two parents ''. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. Six years later, the day was made a permanent national holiday when President Richard Nixon signed it into law in 1972.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released more recently, Gaza Ghetto or Kull The Conqueror?": [

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944.

He was played by John Schneider. The name of\" Beauregard\" may have been chosen after the famous Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard. Bo and his cousin Lucas K.\" Luke\" Duke( Tom Wopat) live in an unincorporated area of the fictional Hazzard County, in Georgia. Bo and Luke own a 1969 Dodge Charger, named\" The General Lee\", which is painted orange, with the Confederate flag on top, and\" 01\" painted on the sides with the name\" General Lee\" inscribed above the doors that were welded shut for safety. Bo and Luke evade the corrupt officials of Hazzard County, Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane and usually end up putting an end to Hogg's latest crooked scheme. The Dukes( including cousin Daisy Duke and Uncle Jesse Duke) were well known for their role in the moonshine business among other interests. Bo and Luke had both been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine. As a result, neither was permitted to use firearms, instead preferring to use bow and arrows, which they sometimes tipped with dynamite. The terms of Bo and Luke's probation included staying within the boundaries of Hazzard County( unless given special permission by their Probation Officer, J.D. Hogg). Bo was the blonde, slightly younger of the two Duke boys, and the more impulsive one of the pair. He often reacted to situations on impulse without thinking, sometimes with an\" act/ speak now, think later\" attitude( although his character was seen to mature slightly over the seasons of the series). Although both Duke boys had a knack of landing themselves in trouble, it was more typically Bo's impulsive nature that often got them into various scrapes, and the slightly more mature Luke, the\" thinker\" of the duo, to find a solution. Bo's eye for the ladies and tendency to fall in love easily, also causes him to sometimes be easily led and affect his judgement and leads to trouble for the Dukes on a number of occasions( most prominently in the feature- length/ two- part story\" Carnival of Thrills\", produced at the end of the second season and broadcast at the start of the third). The character was nearly always seen wearing the same style of clothes, with a yellow shirt( with a blue T- shirt underneath for the first two seasons and some of third; this T- shirt is brown in the pilot episode), and light blue jeans. The exact hue of the shirt varied across the seasons- early on it was a deeper yellow; mid-run it was more of a cream color, and late examples saw it being more of a grey tone. The second episode produced and broadcast,\" Daisy's Song\", is notable for Bo instead wearing a red shirt for much of the story. A sequence in the fifth episode,\" High Octane\", sees Bo dressed in a light blue shirt, and many early publicity shots see the character dressed in a darker blue denim shirt. The character of Bo was best known for his rebel yell exclamation of the catchphrase, Yee- Haa!; cousin Luke sometimes also performed such a yell, but on a less regular basis. ( Actor Tom Wopat had trouble mastering the high- pitched yell early on, and in the opening credits and many examples within the episodes, it is actually a recording of John Schneider's version used twice to represent both Duke boys' yell). Most of the time, it was Bo who drove\" The General Lee\", with his cousin Luke riding shotgun( although these roles were swapped more regularly in later seasons); very early episodes suggested that the\" General\" belonged solely to Bo( Luke is said to have had a car that was wrecked very shortly before the start of the first episode,\" One Armed Bandits\"), but by mid-first season, it was more implied that both Bo and Luke owned the\" General Lee\" evenly between them. Bo was an ex-stock car driver( though he joined the Nascar Circuit for most of season 5 with his cousin Luke), and he was typically the one known for taking the\" General\" on most of its legendary jumps. Because its doors were welded shut, Bo and Luke always had to climb in and out of the car through the windows. Actors John Schneider and Tom Wopat have admitted that, on occasions that the roles were reversed and Luke drove, they found it much more difficult to climb in and out of the opposite window to which they were accustomed. Bo later left Hazzard County, along with his cousin Luke, to join the NASCAR circuit( coinciding with Schneider's and Wopat's decision to walk out of the show during the fifth season over a dispute over royalties owed to them), although how they managed to do this with the probation conditions in place was never revealed; Bo's cousin Coy( Byron Cherry), who was very similar in both appearance and nature to Bo, replaced Bo until he returned to the series a few months later. According to the 1997 film, Bo left Hazzard again to pursue a successful NASCAR career, this time without Luke. Shortly before his return to Hazzard, he crashed his car, and is still in Hazzard in the 2000 film. Although he was a lifelong bachelor, in the 2000 film, he met a woman named Gabrielle( nicknamed Gabby) in Los Angeles and convinced her to go to Hazzard to be with him.\nDocument[4](Title: Walter Halliday) Walter Halliday( also spelled Haliday, Halyday, and Holliday) was a long- serving royal minstrel in England in the 15th century.

Antionum also bordered on the seashore, apparently to the east of the land. The name Antionum was given the land by the Zoramites who gathered and settled the area. When Alma and his brethren went to the land to preach to the Zoramites they were surprised to find that the Zoramites had built synagogues and astonished at their unusual form of worship. Those who believed in the words of Alma and his missionary companions were cast out of the land and went north to the land of Jershon to live among the people of Ammon, the Lamanite converts. The Zoramites eventually allied with the Lamanites in an attempt to overthrow the Nephite government( as had done Amlici). The combined Zoramite/ Lamanite army gathered in the land Antionum as the Nephites gathered in the land of Jershon. In large part due to inferior defensive technology, the Lamanites were afraid to face the Nephites at that juncture, so they departed the land of Antionum into the wilderness, toward the land of Manti where a battle ensued.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Kutsna Amirejibi) Kutsna the Chamberlain,\" Kutsna Amirejibi\",( fl. 1350 \u2013 1415) was a Georgian nobleman active during and in the aftermath of Timur's invasions of Georgia.

Over the years, he has participated in investigative field work, mainly in Denmark and Greece, but also other countries [Afghanistan, Cambodia and Turkey], always adopting a highly systematic and methodical approach and producing widely acclaimed drawings of his finds. Erik Hansen was only very young, only five years old, when he lost his parents and was raised by his aunt Karen and\nuncle Jeppe in the villa behind the bishop's palace in Ribe in southwest Jutland. As a maths student from Ribe Cathedral School and timber apprentice from the city technical school, he joined the University of Copenhagen to study mathematics, physics and chemistry. He also completed the preparatory examination in philosophy course. He quickly realized that he should follow the footsteps of his father and become an architect. After one year he changed to School of Architecture, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, where he studied in Buildings and architectural history at Professor Mogens Koch's department where his artisanal interest and knowledge in carpentry was relevant. Architect Otto von Sprechelsen was one of Erik's best friends. Throughout his working life, Erik undertook the survey and documentation of building culture and monuments with careful measurements; the aim was to understand the monument and its construction technology, building and organizational factors underlying. His role model in this artisanal approach to conservation work was the Danish architect-archaeologist Ejnar Dyggve. Erik Hansen \"sterile\" surveying and his incomprehensible stringent lines in ink, which in all their simplicity, contained the necessary information for an understanding of the present monuments structural state formed school not only in Denmark but in many other countries where he was sent on mission by UNESCO to Afghanistan and Cambodia. Erik Hansen's international students in the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture were from Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greece, Mexico and other Scandinavian countries. His stay in Greece was one of the more durable and linked to Apollo's sanctuary in Delphi. A few times he stayed there for several years, other times he visited the site every six months. The first major work of the Ecole Francaise d'Ath\u00e8nes was examining Siphniernes famous Treasury in Delphi in the years 1955-1965, a large-scale topographic atlas of the sanctuary, which was completed in 1968, and finally his outstanding research in Apollo's Temple and its reconstruction after a landslide in 373 [BC]. His unusually precise measurements of each stone after another, in conjunction with construction contracts with named contractors was carved in stone, was released in French school big series Fouilles the Delphes, in three much attractive Volumes in 2010. In the many years living abroad he was accompanied by his Swedish wife Inger, called Kickan, who was pharmacist by education and a skilled photographer. Kickan was not just Erik's wife, she continued to be his tireless friend and engaged in everything he was dealing with. They both engaged with locals and wrote about what they saw and experienced. In Delphi they knew most of the inhabitants, and one was reminded about when travelling to Delphi, as one would carry a bag full of letters to their friends. Kickan and Erik also had their own traditions in Greece when the moon was full. They went out to the temple in dark and sat out there in silence, while the moon slowly rose above the deep valley of Delphi. Admittedly it was strictly forbidden. Erik lost Kickan in 2008 and lived alone for the remaining eight years of his life. Along with his work in UNESCO in training young professionals for and restoration of monuments in Afghanistan, for example the Ghurid Portal of the Friday Mosque of Herat in Afghanistan [Kabul and Herat, 1964-5], then Cambodia [Phnom Kulen,1968], and Korea, he also was deeply engaged in the difficult restoration works of the beautiful \"Marmorbro\" [the marble bridge] of Frederiksholms Channel in Copenhagen and its portals in the years 1977-1982. Also from this work there are stacks of upscale drawings produced in his hand-drawn lines that Akademir\u00e5det celebrated in 1977 awarding him Eckersberg medal. Also in France he in 1987 revered Prix Mendel, Academie des Inscriptions and Belles Lettres. Subsequently, in 2010, he was awarded the distinguished C. F. Hansen Medal for work with Siphniernes Treasury. Finally, his own residence, a city house built in 1725 in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, was an example of the simple building well preserved and maintained a citizen's house in which he lived with his wife Inger and their close friendship and entertained his colleagues, friends and students (national and internationals). Erik Hansen's motto: \" Well begun is half done - but well completed is only half started\", summarizes his fine distinctive way of life.\nDocument[2](Title: Hans Wunderlich) Hans Wunderlich( 18 June 1899- 26 December 1977) was a German journalist and politician of the SDP.

Sahm was born in Anklam, present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and educated as a lawyer, in 1906 he became a member of the Magdeburg city council and served from 1912 to 1919 as a deputy mayor of Bochum. In the meantime he also worked in the government of occupied Warsaw during World War I. In 1919 he was elected mayor of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), a city that had formerly belonged to the German Empire. In the same year Danzig and the surrounding territory was to be severed from Germany and turned into a city-state according to the Versailles treaty. After the establishment of the Free City of Danzig in 1920, Sahm became first President of the Senate, the de facto head of state beneath the High Commissioner of the League of Nations. Sahm protested against the take-over of the sea resort town (Ostseebad) Westerplatte by the League of Nations and Poland's establishment of a military transport depot. He held the office until 1931, re-elected two times. While Poland was in charge for Danzig's foreign affairs, citizens had to take on a separate \"Danzig\" citizenship or, if they wanted to retain their German citizenship, had to move out of the territory. Sahm politics aimed to strengthen the Free City's ties to the Weimar Republic and to ward off Polish claims; nevertheless the relations with Poland intermittently improved after the implementation of a customs union and the institution of the Danzig gulden in 1923, which protected Danzig from the hyperinflation in Germany. A nonpartisan, he proceeded tactically along party lines, which caused several difficulties in his government and finally led to his overthrow by the Danzig German National People's Party. In 1931 he became mayor of Berlin, a position he held even after the government takeover of the Nazi Party in 1933, though actually disempowered by the appointment of state commissioner Julius Lippert. Sahm joined the Nazi party in November 1933. He resigned in 1935 and was appointed a German envoy to Norway one year later. Sahm died in Oslo. He is buried at the Waldfriedhof Dahlem in Berlin.\nDocument[4](Title: Charlotte Lyon-Bowes, Lady Glamis) Charlotte Lyon-Bowes, Lady Glamis (\"n\u00e9e\" Grimstead; 22 January 1797 \u2013 19 January 1881) was a daughter of Joseph Valentine Grimstead, of Ewood Park and Merry Hall, and Charlotte Jane Sarah Walsh.

The film was selected as the Iranian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. It is the final part of Kiarostami's Koker trilogy, and the plot revolves around the production of the second film; \" And Life Goes On...\", which itself was a revisitation of the first film - \" Where Is the Friend's Home?\". Like much of Kiarostami's work, \"Through the Olive Trees\" is filmed in a naturalistic way; a complex study of the link between art and life, its narrative often blurs the boundaries between fiction and reality.

The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay; winning two for Best Actress and Best Production Design. The 1944 version was the second version to be filmed, following the British film\" Gaslight\", directed by Thorold Dickinson and released in 1940. This 1944 version was directed by George Cukor and starred Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, and 18- year- old Angela Lansbury in an Oscar- nominated screen debut( Supporting Actress). \" Gaslight\" had a larger scale and budget than the earlier film, and lends a different feel to the material.

This film features numerous deviations from the original stage play, though the central drama of a husband trying to drive his wife insane in order to distract her from his criminal activities remains.

He was the oldest son of Henry I the Fowler and Matilda. Otto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father's death in 936. He continued his father's work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king's powers at the expense of the aristocracy. Through strategic marriages and personal appointments, Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom's most important duchies. This reduced the various dukes, who had previously been co-equals with the king, to royal subjects under his authority. Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen royal authority and subjected its clergy to his personal control. After putting down a brief civil war among the rebellious duchies, Otto defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, thus ending the Hungarian invasions of Western Europe. The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto a reputation as a savior of Christendom and secured his hold over the kingdom. By 961, Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy. The patronage of Otto and his immediate successors facilitated a so-called \"Ottonian Renaissance\" of arts and architecture. Following the example of Charlemagne's coronation as \"Emperor of the Romans\" in 800, Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962 by Pope John XII in Rome. Otto's later years were marked by conflicts with the papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy. Reigning from Rome, Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire, which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm's further expansion to the south. To resolve this conflict, the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son Otto II in April 972. Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in May 973. Otto II succeeded him as Holy Roman Emperor.\nDocument[6](Title: Kosher Kitty Kelly) Kosher Kitty Kelly is a 1926 silent film comedy drama produced by Joseph P.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant) The Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant or Guosheng Nuclear Power Plant( \u570b\u8056\u6838\u80fd\u767c\u96fb\u5ee0), Second Nuclear Power Plant( \u7b2c\u4e8c\u6838\u80fd\u767c\u96fb\u5ee0 or \u6838\u4e8c), is a nuclear power plant in Wanli, New Taipei, Taiwan.

Appearing on the film's soundtrack\" Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by American singer Donny Osmond as the singing voice of Captain Li Shang in lieu of American actor BD Wong, who provides the character's speaking voice. The song also features contributions from Lea Salonga as Mulan, Eddie Murphy as Mushu, and Harvey Fierstein, Jerry Tondo and Wilder himself as Yao, Chien- Po and Ling, respectively. In addition, Mushu has a speaking line unlike the other characters in the song. \" I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written to replace the song\" We'll Make a Man of You\" after the film's original songwriter Stephen Schwartz departed from the project in favor of working on DreamWorks' \" The Prince of Egypt\"( 1998). Wilder and Zippel were inspired to complete the song after conceiving its ironic title, and the initial draft of the track was immediately approved by Disney. Prior to\" Mulan\", Osmond had auditioned for the role of Hercules in Disney's\" Hercules\"( 1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up- tempo military- style song that incorporates both Eastern and Western musical styles,\" I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her, while its lyrics explore hyper- masculinity contradicted with Mulan's gender. \" I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics, some of whom dubbed it the film's best song, while praising Osmond's performance. Critics have also drawn comparisons between the song and Disney's\" Hercules\" while likening Mulan's role and transformation to actress Demi Moore's performance as Lieutenant Jordan O' Neil in the film\" G. I. Jane\"( 1997). The song has since appeared on several\" best of\" Disney songs lists, including those of\" Total Film\" and the\" New York Post\".

In 1998, she became the mayor of Tegucigalpa and held the position for four years; during this time she was involved in a political scandal over the embezzlement of public funds. Vilma was born in Santa B\u00e1rbara to a large family of eight children who relocated to Tegucigalpa in the 1970s: There she spent her childhood, attended college, and met her husband, Cesar Castellanos Madrid. Cesar had strong political aspirations which eventually led to him being elected mayor of the Central District of Honduras in 1997; this post was taken over by his wife in 1998 after his untimely death in a helicopter crash and she presided in this role until 2002. Vilma's involvement as mayor included the creation of a project called \"El Vaso de Leche\", which was aimed at alleviating the suffering of poor children living in the slums of Honduras. In 1999 she met with Marisabel Rodriguez, the wife of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez : Rodriguez donated several million bolivars to the project but a later investigation concluded that this money was never handed over to those who needed it. Escalante claimed that the money had been misappropriated by the private secretary in charge of the company responsible for distributing it. She was indicted for the crime of embezzlement of public funds but has never appeared in court to face those charges. None of these accusations seemed to harm her political career. Vilma was elected a deputy of the National Congress of Honduras from 2006 to 2010, and she has represented Honduras in the Central American parliament.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Consort Liang's husband?": [

Sheeley wrote the song when she was fifteen years old. She had met Elvis Presley, and he encouraged her to write. It was based on her disappointment following a short- lived relationship with a member of a popular singing duo. Sheeley sought Ricky Nelson to record the tune. She drove to his house, and claimed her car had broken down. He came to her aid, and she sprang the song on him. Her version was at a much faster tempo than his recording. The song was recorded by Ricky Nelson on April 17, 1958, and released on Imperial Records through its catalog number: 5528. On 4 August 1958 it became the first number- one song on\" Billboard\" magazine's then- new Hot 100 chart, replacing the magazine's Jockeys and Top 100 charts. It spent two weeks at the number- one spot. It also reached the top ten on the\" Billboard\" Country and Rhythm and Blues charts. Following its success, Sheeley worked with Eddie Cochran. \" Poor Little Fool\" became a radio hit when it was released as part of a four- song Extended Play 45 rpm disc which was excerpted from the artist's second LP,\" Ricky Nelson\". Responding to the buzz, Lew Chudd, the founder and head of Imperial Records, rushed out a single version( on both 45 and 78 rpm). Nelson objected, however, believing that the move would hurt sales of the EP. Under his contract with Imperial, the singer had approval rights for all picture- sleeve art and to express his displeasure with Chudd's decision, he chose not to select a photograph for the\" Poor Little Fool\" single. As a result,\" Poor Little Fool\" was the only Ricky Nelson single released by Imperial to be issued in the United States without a photo in a plain label- cut- out sleeve. The\" Dodgers\" and Johnny Angel released a cover version of the song in 1958 on Skyway 45- 119- AA. The Fleetwoods recorded it in 1962. Terry Black released a version of the song in 1965 on his debut album,\" Only 16\", and it reached# 6 in Canada.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Prince Charles Louis, Duke Of Chartres born?": [

He was born in Brignoles, into an artistic family that produced fourteen painters over six generations. His grandfather Georges Parrocel (1540- ca. 1614) (no surviving works) and his father Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1595\u20131660) were both painters. One badly restored painting of Bath\u00e9lemy survives in the church of Saint-Sauveur in Brignoles, France. His brothers Jean Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1631\u20131653) (no surviving works) and Louis Parrocel (1634\u20131694) also became painters. He was soon noticed He was only thirteen years old when his father died in 1660. His elder brother Louis, who was already established as a painter in the Languedoc, took him under his care and gave him a training as painter. Three years later he ran away from his brother's house to Marseilles. His talent as a painter became soon noticed and he got a commission for a number of paintings with scenes of the life of Saint Anthony of Padua for the church Saint-Martin. But he only executed two of them. it is also possible that he painted them during his second stay in the Provence. He left for Paris and stayed there for four years, perfecting his skills. He then returned to the Provence and continued his journey to Italy, where he would stay for eight years. In Rome he became the pupil of Jacques Courtois, a famous painter of battle scenes who was also known als \"le Bourguignon\" or \"il Borgognone\". He also studied the works of Salvator Rosa, an unorthodox proto-Romantic painter. Joseph Parrocel worked with him in his workshop and was thoroughly influenced by him, even if he gave his style later a more French touch. Parrocel then started a journey through Italy and finally arrived in Venice. He was planning to settle in this town but after eight brigands had attempted to murder him on the Rialto Bridge, he left Italy in disgust. He settled in Paris in 1675 and earned himself a reputation. He was accepted as an elected member at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 29 February 1676 and he became an academician on 14 November 1676 with his admission piece \"Siege of Maastricht\". In 1703 he became a councillor at the Academy. As a member of the Academy, he would obtain royal commissions. However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and the Palace of Versailles. During his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings. He died, aged 57, in Paris. He is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also landscapes, historical pieces and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the H\u00f4tel de Soubise and the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of the \"f\u00eates galantes\" of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes. His differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours. During his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University). Joseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690\u20131774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688\u20131752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667\u20131722) and Pierre (1670\u20131739), who both became painters and engravers.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[4](Title: Invasion of the Bee Girls) Invasion of the Bee Girls (UK video title: Graveyard Tramps) is a 1973 science fiction film.

He was born approximately five months after the murder of his father. Joseph told Emma before he died what the child's name should be. Beginning in December 1847, he was raised by his mother and her second husband, Lewis C. Bidamon. Smith was a highly effective missionary for the RLDS Church. From 1865 to 1873, he conducted missionary trips throughout the Midwest, Utah Territory, and California, debating preachers of different theologies, including representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). From 1873 to 1885, Smith was a counselor to his brother Joseph Smith III in the First Presidency of the RLDS Church. He was also the father of Elbert A. Smith, who was a member of the First Presidency and a Presiding Patriarch in the RLDS Church. Smith was called the \"Sweet Singer of Israel\" because many who knew him, who heard him sing, and joined him in song, stated that he was the most inspiring singer of God they had encountered. The Joseph Smith Historic Site, maintained by the Community of Christ, houses Smith's original paintings of Nauvoo, Illinois.

I feel very sad and the tears run out of my eyes all the time and I don't know why. ... strive as I will my heart sinks like lead. ... I must tell someone my troubles.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Suzanne Luna) Suzanne Luna is an American producer and director best known for\" The Ellen DeGeneres Show\".\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Operation Secret?": [

In 1967 the Public Auction Yards hosted an event to showcase the region \u2019s vast livestock industry. By the fall of 1968, a full- fledged livestock show with 250 exhibitors and 600 entries was underway. The first NILE consisted of livestock shows, horse shows, and rodeo and today those traditions continue as the NILE Stock Show and ProRodeo has become one of the largest agricultural events of the Northwest. Through the years the NILE Stock Show has always been a show with some of the purest and most influential genetics in the world. The NILE is host to several national cattle breed shows and sales. Additionally, the NILE Gold Buckle Select Horse Sales features a weanling/ yearling sale, performance horse sale, as well as six different futurities. The NILE ProRodeo is Montana \u2019s most prestigious rodeos. As one of the first rodeos of the qualifying year, the NILE consistently showcases many of the top contestants in the PRCA. In 2006, the NILE added a Ranch Rodeo to their fall event. The popularity of this event and the essence of displaying real American ranch cowboys in this type of event quickly spread across the region. In 2009 the NILE Ranch Rodeo Finals was established in which winning teams from NILE sanctioned Ranch Rodeos from across the region came to compete for the top honor of being the NILE series champion team. The winning team is also eligible to compete in the Western States Ranch Rodeo Association Finals held in Winnemucca, NV Since the NILE \u2019s inception, it has grown to incorporate a variety of other events, like hosting the Professional Bull Riders each year in April. The NILE has been the host of the longest running event stop of the elite PBR Built FORD Tough Series. In 2008, the NILE purchased the Montana Agri-Trade Exposition( MATE Show) held annually the third week of February each year. A large focus has been placed on programs to encourage youth participation like the Merit Heifer Program, Jr. Fed Show and Sale, Jr. Breeding Cattle Shows, Youth Judging Contests, school assemblies, and an agricultural education program for over 2,000 area 4th graders. The first NILE was funded much the way it is funded today \u2013 through memberships from businesses, ranchers, and other supporters as well as sponsorships from corporate partners. The NILE is dedicated to the promotion of livestock production, agricultural education, and respect for our western tradition. We believe those are important for the future of agriculture.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

Born in Liverpool, England, Lavinia was the daughter of Olivia Serres and John Thomas Serres. Olivia Serres gained notoriety by claiming to be the daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, a younger brother of King George III of the United Kingdom. In 1822 Lavinia married Anthony Ryves, a portrait painter. They were divorced in 1841. In 1844\" Princess Lavinia\" tried to take Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington to court for having\" overlooked\", as George III's executor, a bequest of \u00a3 15,000 to Olivia. In 1850 Lavinia published a pamphlet requesting financial aid from Queen Victoria. In 1866, aged sixty- nine, Princess Lavinia asked the Court of Probate to declare her the legitimate granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland and award her the \u00a3 15,000 bequest\" left\" by George III. In the process of the 1866 trial, Lavinia produced several remarkable documents attesting to her claims, and a handwriting expert testified to the authenticity of George III's and James Wilmot's signatures. Testimony was introduced that in fact the Duke of Kent had supported Olivia financially, and had spoken of Olivia as\" my cousin Serres\", apparently believing her story. The trial was most considered remarkable, perhaps, for the claims made by Dr. Walter Smith, Lavinia's barrister, that George III had been privately married to a Quaker, Hannah Lightfoot, and that in consequence thereof, neither George IV nor Queen Victoria had any right to the throne. Lavinia's case, however, quickly ran into difficulties: in some of the submitted documents, George III had\" signed\" his name as\" George Guelph\"; in others, William Pitt and Lord Brook had\" signed\" as earls before they had in fact become earls. The court found that Lavinia was the legitimate daughter of John and Olivia Serres and was not the granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland. The court did not prosecute Lavinia for forgery: Lavinia maintained she believed in good faith that the documents left her by Olivia were genuine. It is thought that the documents were in fact forged at the behest of Olivia, rather than Lavinia, perhaps by William FitzClarence, Olivia's boyfriend, who had calligraphic talents. Lavinia continued to write pamphlets in support of her claims, and her case was reheard by the House of Lords. She died with her claims unrecognized.\nDocument[3](Title: Charles Bruffy) Charles Bruffy( born 1958) is an American choral conductor.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: My Name Is Bandu) My Name is Bandu is a 2015 Sri Lankan Sinhala comedy, family film directed by Suranga de Alwis and produced by Suranga de Alwis.

The film dramatizes the creation of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima. The film originated in October 1945 as a project of actress Donna Reed and her high school science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, who was a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Bob Considine wrote the treatment, which was sent to MGM script writers. The title was supplied by President Harry S. Truman.

Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, was hired as a consultant for $10,000 .

An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the \"Enola Gay\" on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and it is said that leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid.

He was raised to the high rank of \"sebastokrator\" by his older brother John II Komnenos in reward for his support, but they later fell out, as Isaac began to covet the throne. In 1130, Isaac and his sons fled to exile after becoming involved in a conspiracy against John. For several years, they wandered in Asia Minor and the Levant, trying to gain support from the local rulers, but ultimately in vain. John's military successes forced Isaac to seek a reconciliation with his brother in 1138, although he did not give up his designs on the throne. In 1139, after his oldest son defected to the Seljuk Turks, Isaac was exiled to Heraclea Pontica. During the struggle for John's succession in 1143, he supported the unsuccessful candidacy of his elder nephew, likewise named Isaac, over his younger nephew Manuel I Komnenos. In 1150, weakened by the onset of an illness, he was forced to retire from public life by Manuel. Isaac then devoted himself to the construction of the monastery of Theotokos Kosmosoteira at Bera (modern Feres) in western Thrace, where he was to be buried. Isaac was noted for his erudition and his patronage of learning, and is considered the author of a number of scholarly and poetic works. He is also notable for rebuilding the Chora Church in Constantinople, where his mosaic donor portrait survives to this day.

Gilles Carle, who was a key figure in the development of a commercial Qu\u00e9bec cinema, worked as a graphic artist and writer before he joined the National Film Board of Canada in 1960.

The quirkily paced, proto-feminist \"La Vraie Nature de Bernadette\" \u2013 widely regarded as his best film \u2013 and \"Le Mort d\u2019un b\u00fbcheron\" eventually led to the more mainstream but graceful \"Les Plouffe\" and the epic love story \"Maria Chapdelaine\", both classics of Quebec cinema. In 1972 Carle won the Canadian Film Award for best Director for his \"The True Nature of Bernadette\". Carle was born in Maniwaki, Quebec. His film \"50 ans\", celebrating the \"50 years\" of the National Film Board of Canada, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.\nDocument[3](Title: Walter Runciman, 1st Baron Runciman) Walter Runciman, 1st Baron Runciman ( 6 July 1847 \u2013 13 August 1937) was an English and Scottish shipping magnate. He was born in the Scottish town of Dunbar. He was the fourth son of Walter Runciman, master of a schooner and later a member of the coastguard, and Jane, oldest daughter of John Finlay, shipowner, also of Dunbar. The family moved to the coastguard station at Cresswell, Northumberland, because his father was appointed a position there. After attending a church school, the younger Walter ran away from home to work at sea in 1859. This explains why he was referred to by his grandson Steven as\" a Geordie of Scots descent who ran away to sea at 11, was a master mariner by 21 and founded a shipping line\", and, usefully for historians of a related area, Runciman wrote several books based on his years at sea. He also served briefly as a Liberal Member of Parliament. In 1889, Runciman founded the South Shields Shipping Company, based in the port of South Shields, on the south bank at the mouth of the River Tyne, which was then part of County Durham but now in Tyne and Wear. Walter Runciman was Managing Director and Secretary, and John Elliott was the chairman. In 1892 the company offices moved up the River Tyne to the city- port of Newcastle. In April 1897 the company changed its name to Moor Line Ltd. Runciman and his son, who had carried on business as partners in Runciman and Co, were appointed Managing Directors of Moor Line. Elliott died in 1898 and the elder Runciman held the position of Chairman until his death in 1937. Runciman was created a baronet in 1906, and served as Liberal MP for Hartlepool from 1914 to 1918. In 1910 he wrote\" The Tragedy of St. Helena\", an account of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile and death. In 1933, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Runciman of Shoreston. Four years later his son, the long- serving MP Walter Runciman( 1870 \u2013 1949), followed him into the House of Lords with the title Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford.

Outey was the youngest son of King Soriyopear. He was appointed the \"ouparach\" (heir apparent or viceroy) in 1618. He was appointed the regent after Chey Chettha II's death, assuming the title \"uprayorach\" (\u17a7\u1797\u1799\u17c4\u179a\u17b6\u1787), the title usually borne by kings who had abdicated but retained executive powers. Outey married Princess Ang Vathi, whom was the former fianc\u00e9e of king Thommo Reachea II (Ponhea To). The dissatisfied king rebelled against him but was defeated and executed together with Ang Vathi in 1631. Ang Tong Reachea (Ponhea Nou) was crowned the new king. Ang Tong Reachea died in mysterious circumstances in June 1640. Although Ponhea Chan should be the next king, Outey forced Chan to give the crown to his own son Batom Reachea. With the help of Cham and Malay mercenaries, Chan assassinated Outey on 5 January 1642. In the same time Batom Reachea was away on a hunting trip. Chan captured him and had him executed in Oudong.\nDocument[6](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film T\u0159i Chlapi V Chalup\u011b?": [

The film, directed and choreographed by Busby Berkeley, is considered a camp classic, and is noted for its use of musical numbers with fruit hats. Included among the 10 highest- grossing films of that year, it was at that time Fox's most expensive production. Musical highlights include Carmen Miranda performing an insinuating, witty version of\" You Discover You're in New York\" that lampoons fads, fashions, and wartime shortages of the time. The film is also memorable for Miranda's\" The Lady in the Tutti Frutti Hat\", which because of its sexual innuendo( dozens of scantily clad women handling very large bananas), apparently prevented the film from being shown in Brazil on its initial release. Even in the US the censors dictated that the chorus girls must hold the bananas at the waist and not at the hip. Alice Faye sings\" A Journey to a Star, No Love, No Nothin',\" and the surreal finale\" The Polka- Dot Polka.\" The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction- Interior Decoration, Color( James Basevi, Joseph C. Wright, Thomas Little). It was the last musical Faye made as a Hollywood superstar. She was pregnant with her second daughter during filming. In 2014,\" The Gang's All Here\" was deemed\" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nDocument[4](Title: Gracie Films) Gracie Films is an American independent film and television production company created by James L.

It was discovered photographically, when the comet was in outburst and the magnitude was about 13. Precovery images of the comet from March 4, 1902, were found in 1931 and showed the comet at 12th magnitude. The comet is unusual in that while normally hovering at around 16th magnitude, it suddenly undergoes an outburst. This causes the comet to brighten by 1 to 5 magnitudes. This happens with a frequency of 7.3 outbursts per year, fading within a week or two. The magnitude of the comet has been known to vary from 18th magnitude to 10th magnitude, a more than thousand- fold increase in brightness, during its brightest outbursts. Outbursts are very sudden, rising to maximum in about 2 hours, which is indicative of their cryovolcanic origin; and with the times of outburst modulated by an underlying 57- day periodicity possibly suggesting that its large nucleus is an extremely slow rotator. The comet is a member of a relatively new class of objects called\" Centaurs\", of which at least 400 are known. These are small icy bodies with orbits between those of Jupiter and Neptune. Astronomers believe that Centaurs have been recently perturbed inward from the Kuiper belt, a disk of Trans- Neptunian Objects occupying a region extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. Frequent perturbations by Jupiter will likely accumulate and cause the comet to migrate either inward or outward by the year 4000. The dust and gas comprising the comet's nucleus is part of the same primordial materials from which the Sun and planets were formed billions of years ago. The complex carbon- rich molecules they contain may have provided some of the raw materials from which life originated on Earth. The comet nucleus is estimated to be in diameter. 29 P reached perihelion on March 7, 2019 and opposition on October 9, 2019.\nDocument[2](Title: Plunkett & Macleane) Plunkett & Macleane is a 1999 British historical action comedy film directed by Jake Scott, and starring Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler.

He sadly explains he is a humbug -- an ordinary old man who, by a hot air balloon, came to Oz long ago from Omaha. The Wizard provides the Scarecrow with a head full of bran, pins, and needles (``a lot of bran - new brains ''), the Tin Woodman with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Cowardly Lion a potion of`` courage''. Their faith in the Wizard's power gives these items a focus for their desires. The Wizard decides to take Dorothy and Toto home and leave the Emerald City. At the send - off, he appoints the Scarecrow to rule in his stead, which he agrees to do after Dorothy returns to Kansas. Toto chases a kitten in the crowd and Dorothy goes after him, but the tethers of the balloon break and the Wizard floats away.\nDocument[4](Title: Sylvia Scarlett) Sylvia Scarlett is a 1935 romantic comedy film starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, based on\" The Early Life and Adventures of Sylvia Scarlett\", a novel by Compton MacKenzie. Directed by George Cukor, it was notorious as one of the most famous unsuccessful movies of the 1930s. Hepburn plays the title role of Sylvia Scarlett, a female con artist masquerading as a boy to escape the police. The success of the subterfuge is in large part due to the transformation of Hepburn by RKO makeup artist Mel Berns. This film was the first pairing of Grant and Hepburn, who later starred together in\" Bringing Up Baby\"( 1938),\" Holiday\"( 1938), and\" The Philadelphia Story\"( 1940). Grant's performance as a dashing rogue sees him incorporate a Cockney accent and remains widely considered the first time Grant's famous personality began to register on film. ( Grant used the Cockney accent in only a few other films, notably 1939's\" Gunga Din\" and Clifford Odets'\" None but the Lonely Heart\" in 1944.) Cockney was not, however, Cary Grant's original accent. He was born and grew up in Bristol, which has a very different accent from that of London, although it was much closer to Grant's pre-Hollywood accent than the voice he used in most films, a product of his attempting to sound more American in order to broaden the range of roles for which he could be cast.\nDocument[5](Title: Darreh-ye Mirak) Darreh- ye Mirak( also Romanized as Darreh- ye M\u012brak; also known as Darreh, Darreh- i- Aulia, Darreh \u2018 Oly\u0101, and Darreh- ye B\u0101l\u0101) is a village in Baqeran Rural District, in the Central District of Birjand County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The trust then made an agreement with the council for the organ to be based there. The cinema was then renamed as the Paramount in honour of the new resident. The building itself remains the property of Barnsley Metropolitan District Council, and is leased back to Penistone Town Council to keep it open as a cinema.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film My Country'S Wings?": [

Zhou was China's head of government, serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976. Zhou served under Chairman Mao Zedong and was instrumental in the Communist Party's rise to power, and later in consolidating its control, forming foreign policy, and developing the Chinese economy. A skilled and able diplomat, Zhou served as the Chinese foreign minister from 1949 to 1958. Advocating peaceful coexistence with the West after the Korean War, he participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference and the 1955 Bandung Conference, and helped orchestrate Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. He helped devise policies regarding the bitter disputes with the United States, Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India and Vietnam. Zhou survived the purges of other top officials during the Cultural Revolution. While Mao dedicated most of his later years to political struggle and ideological work, Zhou was the main driving force behind the affairs of state during much of the Cultural Revolution. His attempts at mitigating the Red Guards' damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in the Cultural Revolution's later stages. As Mao's health began to decline in 1971 and 1972 and following the death of disgraced Lin Biao, Zhou was elected to the vacant position of First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party by the 10th Central Committee in 1973 and thereby designated as Mao's successor (the third person after Liu Shaoqi and Lin), but still struggled against the Gang of Four internally over leadership of China. His last major public appearance was at the first meeting of the 4th National People's Congress on 13 January 1975, where he presented the government work report. He then fell out of the public eye for medical treatment and died one year later. The massive public outpouring of grief in Beijing turned to anger at the Gang of Four, leading to the 1976 Tiananmen Incident. Although Zhou was succeeded by Hua Guofeng as First Vice Chairman and designated successor, Zhou's ally Deng Xiaoping was able to outmaneuver the Gang of Four politically and took Hua's place as paramount leader by 1978.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Nesmrteln\u00e1 Teta or Illang: The Wolf Brigade?": [

The song is a parody of the 2013 single \"Blurred Lines\" by Robin Thicke, featuring Pharrell Williams and T.I. The song spoofs misuse of proper English grammar and usage, reflecting Yankovic's own rigor for proper syntax and semantics.

The eldest son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, he became Earl of Warwick through marriage, and was the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with political connections that went beyond the country's borders. One of the leaders in the Wars of the Roses, originally on the Yorkist side but later switching to the Lancastrian side, he was instrumental in the deposition of two kings, which led to his epithet of \"Kingmaker\". Through fortunes of marriage and inheritance, Warwick emerged in the 1450s at the centre of English politics. Originally, he was a supporter of King Henry VI; however, a territorial dispute with Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, led him to collaborate with Richard, Duke of York, in opposing the king. From this conflict, he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais, a position that benefited him greatly in the years to come. The political conflict later turned into full-scale rebellion, where in battle York was slain, as was Warwick's father Salisbury. York's son, however, later triumphed with Warwick's assistance, and was crowned King Edward IV. Edward initially ruled with Warwick's support, but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king's choice of Elizabeth Woodville as his wife. After a failed plot to crown Edward's brother, George, Duke of Clarence, Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne. The triumph was short-lived, however: on 14 April 1471, Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet, and killed. Warwick's historical legacy has been a matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died later, September Affair or A Gathering Of Eagles?": [

The first of Tati's films to be released in colour,\" Mon Oncle\" won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a Special Prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film, receiving more honors than any of Tati's other cinematic works. The film centers on the socially awkward yet lovable character of Monsieur Hulot and his quixotic struggle with postwar France's infatuation with modern architecture, mechanical efficiency and consumerism. As with most Tati films,\" Mon Oncle\" is largely a visual comedy; color and lighting are employed to help tell the story. The dialogue in\" Mon Oncle\" is barely audible, and largely subordinated to the role of a sound effect. The drifting noises of heated arguments and idle banter complement other sounds and the physical movements of the characters, intensifying comedic effect. The complex soundtrack also uses music to characterize environments, including a lively musical theme that represents Hulot's world of comical inefficiency and freedom. At its debut in 1958 in France,\" Mon Oncle\" was denounced by some critics for what they viewed as a reactionary or even\" poujadiste\" view of an emerging French consumer society, which had lately embraced a new wave of industrial modernization and a more rigid social structure. However, this criticism soon gave way in the face of the film's huge popularity in France and abroad \u2013 even in the U.S., where rampant discretionary consumption and a recession had caused those on both the right and the left to question the economic and social values of the era. The film was another big success for Tati with a total of 4,576,928 admissions in France.\nDocument[3](Title: Delusions of Grandeur (Fleming and John album)) Delusions of Grandeur is an album by Fleming and John that was released in 1995.\nDocument[4](Title: Cuscatancingo) Cuscatancingo is a municipality in the San Salvador department of El Salvador.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[4](Title: Itapetinga Radio Observatory) The Itapeting Radio Observatory (Portuguese: R\u00e1dio Observat\u00f3rio de Itapetinga - ROI) is a radio observatory located in the municipality of Atibaia in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil.

Tulard was one of the experts involved in verifying the heart believed to be that of Louis XVII of France, actually the Dauphin of France as the heir apparent to the throne, who died in 1795 in imprisonment. Scientists using DNA samples from Queen Anne of Romania, and her brother Andre de Bourbon- Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie- Antoinette's hair, proved the young royal's identity. Historic evidence as to the location of the heart over the decades was also considered. In a summary of the investigation in 2004, Tulard wrote:\" This heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII. We can never be 100 per cent sure but this is about as sure as it gets\". In April 2010, he became Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, Thalapathi or Pour La Peau D'Un Flic?": [

The parish was established in 1867. The original sanctuary and current building were designed by the Rev. Frederick B. Scheetz and completed in 1884. The building is a rare example of an extant wood framed Carpenter Gothic church in the state of Missouri. The interior walls and vaulted ceilings are covered with narrow strips of wood paneling set diagonally on the walls and horizontally on the ceiling. A trio of stained glass windows is set above the wooden altar in the apse at the north end of the transept. The church has received few if any alterations since it was built in 1884. An early description of the newly built church would be accurate today:\" The church is frame, 40 feet by 24, with a porch in front 8 by 10 feet, with a bell tower extending above the roof. It is strongly and well built, with a solid stone foundation, which is so high in the rear of the church as to give room for a cellar for wood. The interior is ceiled throughout with narrow stuff put on diagonally, the timbers above do not show.\"' St. Paul's Episcopal Church embodies a distinctive; type of' vernacular' adaptation to the earlier Gothic Revival style important in church construction. Economic exigencies as well as available materials quite probably limited this Midwestern frame structure to a simple relatively small derivative of the more expansive models constructed in the eastern United States. The simple yet elegant form and decorative features of St. Paul's reflect the Midwestern 19th century philosophy of spiritual beliefs constrained by the realities of the time and place. The continuity in the structure can easily be interpreted to reflect the continuity in the religious community which began and still maintains this impressive building. St. Paul's Episcopal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 9, 1985.\nDocument[4](Title: Rocky (1948 film)) Rocky is a 1948 American film directed by Phil Karlson and starring Roddy McDowall.\nDocument[5](Title: Tekle Haymanot) Tekle Haymanot or Takla Haymanot ( Ge'ez \u1270\u12ad\u1208 \u1203\u12ed\u121b\u1296\u1275\" takla h\u0101ym\u0101n\u014dt\", modern\" tekle h\u0101ym\u0101n\u014dt Plant of Faith\"; known in the Coptic Church as Saint Takla Haymanot of Ethiopia)( c. 1215 \u2013 c. 1313) was an Ethiopian Hermit, monk and\" Lek'e P'ap'as\"( Ge'ez Title for the bishop with a higher rank than the other bishops, but a lower rank than the Archbishop or Patriarch) who founded a major monastery in his native province of Shewa.

It was written by Bronislaw Kaper and Walter Jurmann, with lyrics by Gus Kahn. It is sung by Jeanette MacDonald six times in the film, and becomes an anthem for the survivors of the 1906 earthquake. The lyrics of the chorus begin as follows:<br> \"San Francisco, open your Golden Gate<br> You'll let no stranger wait outside your door <br> San Francisco, here is your wanderin' one<br> Saying I'll wander no more. \" The song is now a popular sentimental sing-along at public events such as the city's annual earthquake commemoration. It is one of two official city songs, along with \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco.\" Judy Garland included the song to her concert repertoire, with a new introduction that starts, \"I never will forget Jeanette MacDonald; just to think of her it gives my heart a pang. I never will forget, how that brave Jeanette, just stood there in the ruins and sang. A-a-a-and sang... \" She opened a late 1950s concert at the Cow Palace with her version. It was so well and tumultuously received that she sang it again as an encore. In her later career, her interpretation grew darker.

Rex, Barry White, Diana Ross and various Pan's People appearances. It was the 10th song of this episode, being preceded by David Essex and being followed by Typically Tropical. This version of the song suffered from part of the backing music being omitted. De Paul also performed the song, unusually sat on a motorbike, rather than at her more usual piano on the Bay City Rollers show \"Shang a Lang\" on 7 July 1975. She also performed the song as a special international guest on German TV's \"Die aktuelle Schaubude\", where she played it on a gold upright piano. Although originally a non-album single, it was released for the first time on CD on the de Paul album, \"Greatest Hits\", and has since appeared on a number of CD albums such as \"Best of the Seventies\". More recently, it appeared with an additional backing track, giving it a fuller sound, on \"Into My Music Anthology 1975-1979\", where also the B-side \"Into My Music\" was included as an album track for the first time. Both songs also recently appeared on the MP3 album \"Singles Collection 1974-1979\". \"Rhythm and Blue Jean Baby\" was used as backing music for Karlie Kloss at the Sonia Rykiel Spring/Summer 2008 Fashion Show in Paris.

The district includes roughly twelve square blocks of the city and encompasses 140 buildings, 118 of which are contributing buildings to the district's historic character. The 1901 McLean County Courthouse, the center of government of McLean County, is the focal point of the district.

The Miller-Davis Law Buildings, two of the oldest buildings in the district, were built in 1843 and represent the early period of Bloomington's development. Bloomington's commercial core grew rapidly during the 1850s and 1860s after two railroads opened in the city; while the 1854 Gridley Bank is the only surviving pre-1857 building from this period, several more remain from the later part of the boom. The city continued to grow, and its business district continued to expand, from 1860 until 1900; however, a fire destroyed much of its downtown in 1900. Several buildings in the district date from the rebuilding period of the early 1900s.\nDocument[3](Title: Andr\u00e9-Benjamin Papineau) Andr\u00e9- Benjamin Papineau( December 23, 1809 \u2013 February 1, 1890) was a notary and political figure in Lower Canada. He represented Terrebonne in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1837 until the suspension of the constitution in 1838. He was born in Montreal, the son of Andr\u00e9 Papineau and Marie- Anne Roussel, was educated at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al and received his commission as notary in 1835.

He was a younger son of \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in and became his father's chosen heir upon the death of his elder brothers. Adomn\u00e1n's \"Life of Saint Columba\" has Columba foresee that Eochaid, then a child, will succeed his father in preference to his adult brothers Art\u00far, Eochaid Find and Domangart. In the last two years of his reign, 627\u2013629, Eochaid was apparently co-ruler with Connad Cerr, who predeceased him. Eochaid was followed by his son Domnall Brecc. Eochaid's other sons named by the Senchus fer n-Alban are Conall Crandomna, Failbe (who died at the Battle of Fid Eoin), C\u00fa-cen-m\u00e1thair (whose death is reported in the Annals of Ulster for 604), Conall Bec, Connad or Conall Cerr (who may be the same person as Connad Cerr who died at Fid Eoin), Failbe, Domangart and Domnall Donn (not the same person as Domnall Donn unless his obituary is misplaced by 45 years like that of Ferchar mac Connaid) According to the \"Fled D\u00fain na nG\u00e9d\", Eochaid Buide was the grandfather of Congal C\u00e1ech. The story has anachronistic features as it has Eochaid alive at the time of the battle of Mag Rath (securely dated to within a year of 637), but it is chronologically feasible that Congal C\u00e1ech could have been the son of Eochaid's daughter if the identification of C\u00fa-cen-m\u00e1thair and the dating of his death is correct.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of Eochaid Ailtlethan?": [

Set in the neon- lit nightclub environments of Tokyo, the story follows Oscar, a young American drug dealer who gets shot by the police, but continues to watch subsequent events during an out- of- body experience. The film is shot from a first- person viewpoint, which often floats above the city streets, and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past. No\u00e9 labels the film a\" psychedelic melodrama\". No\u00e9's dream project for many years, the production was made possible after the commercial success of his previous feature film,\" Irr\u00e9versible\"( 2002). \" Enter the Void\" was primarily financed by Wild Bunch, while Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 Films led the actual production. With a mix of professionals and newcomers, the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and psychedelic drug experiences. Principal photography took place on location in Tokyo, and involved many complicated crane shots. Co-producers included the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie, which also provided the computer- generated imagery. The film's soundtrack is a collage of electronic pop and experimental music. A rough cut premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but post-production work continued, and the film was not released in France until almost a year later. A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010.

The Court ruled 7 -- 2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life.

The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician \u00c9variste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation \u03b8n = 1 (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.\nDocument[3](Title: Elena Ecaterina Rare\u0219) Doamna Elena Ecaterina Rare\u015f (died 1553) was the daughter of Jovan Brankovi\u0107 and a princess consort of Moldavia by marriage to Peter IV Rare\u0219.

Conn was the son of the ruling monarch of Ulster at the time, Shane O'Neill, known as  or \"Shane The Proud\". There are conflicting accounts of his mother, those being the Countess Catherine MacLean, final wife of Shane O'Neill, or a daughter of Shane Og Maguire, Prince of Fermanagh, to whom Shane was briefly married to in 1562, or Mary O'Donnell, daughter of Calvagh Prince of Tir Connell. Early in life, he was often held as a pledge for his father and later his brothers good conduct to both the English and to important Irish dynasties. However, by the 1570s, he appears to live in Scotland at the court of the MacLeans. Conn followed his brothers Hugh Gaveloch and Henry MacShane O'Neill into a protracted war against their cousins Turlough Lineach O'Neill and Hugh, the Earl of Tyrone in 1583. Collectively, the ten brothers were known as the \"Mac Shanes\" and waged continual war from 1583 to 1591 for domination of Ulster with the backing of a Scottish army made up of MacLeans and MacDonnells. In 1589, the ruling O'Neill Mor, Sir Turlough Lineach O'Neill, adopted Conn MacShane and declared him Tanist of the O'Neill nation. Conn opposed his first cousin, Hugh Rua O'Neill, the 2nd Earl of Tyrone continuously during the 1590s and into the 17th century. He went so far as to travel to England and accuse the Earl of treason in 1590. He and his brother Hugh had a letter of thanks, written by a Spanish Captain who had been shipwrecked and given hospitality by the Earl. The case was tried in front of Elizabeth and for political reasons, the Earl went unpunished. Soon after Conn's brothers Hugh and Brian were caught and executed by the Earl and the MacShanes had to return to Ulster no better off than before. In 1590, Conn was briefly elected The O'Neill Mor. However, he was overthrown and during the 9 Years War, he was arrested and again held captive by his cousin on an island stronghold in Killetragh. As the Earl started to lose the war, Conn escaped and joined the English, fighting with them to defeat of the Earl. Conn was married to Mary O'Donnell, a Princess of the Tirconnell dynasty. It is difficult to determine whether she was a daughter of Manus O'Donnell or his son Sir Hugh O'Donnell, as both have named Mary or Mair\u00e9ad. When the Earl fled Ireland in 1607, Conn was rewarded with a large estate known at Clabbye in south-western Ulster for the rest of life. Conn had two sons that wielded some power of their own; Hugh McShane O'Neill, and Art Og' O'Neill. Hugh was the Chief of the McShane clan along the western Bann river in Glenconkeyne, and Art Og' inherited Clabbye and was known to have fortified it and held it into the 1640s. Conn MacShane's family was considered close enough to the Earl's to be considered part of the titled bloodline. In 1640, the 3rd Earl of Tyrone listed the descendants of Conn as the final lineage capable of claiming the title of \"Tyrone\" should all the lineage of Mathew \"Ferdocha\" O'Neill be extinguished. To that fact, in 1683, Conn's grandson Cormac MacShane O'Neill traveled to Spain and unsuccessfully petitioned for the title and position as the 8th Earl/Count of Tyrone in the Spanish creation. He was undermined by a young nephew of the 7th Earl/Count. However, upon his death in the early 1690s, the line of Conn MacShane O'Neill back in Ireland reverted using the O'Neill Mor name again, and kept up the traditions of election within the O'Neill family beyond 1888.\nDocument[5](Title: William White (actor)) William White was a film producer and actor.

Lewis Watson until 1806, was an English peer. His legal struggle with his former tutor over the occupation of the rectory of Kettering led to the case of \"Fletcher\" v. \"Lord Sondes\", in which the House of Lords declared that bonds of special resignation were simoniacal. After extensive litigation, he succeeded in instituting his younger brother in the rectory. The eldest son of Lewis Watson, 2nd Baron Sondes, and his wife Mary , he succeeded his father in the peerage in 1806. On 1 February 1810, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1814, Sondes presented his tutor, William Brice Fletcher, to the rectory of Kettering, of which he held the advowson. Fletcher entered into a bond with Sondes that he should resign the rectory when either of Sondes' younger brothers became capable of accepting a benefice. Sondes requested Fletcher's resignation in 1820 for the purpose of presenting his younger brother Henry; Fletcher, who had expected Sondes to find another benefice for him, refused, and Sondes successfully sued him for non-compliance. Fletcher appealed the verdict up to the House of Lords; in 1827, on judicial advice, they reversed the verdict and declared the bond to be simoniacal. Bonds of general resignation, where the appointee to a benefice bonded himself to resign whenever called upon by a patron to do so, had been held to be simoniacal in the case of \"Bishop of London\" v. \"Ffytche\". However, bonds of special resignation, like that signed by Fletcher, were thought to have been legal and were frequently used until \"Fletcher\" v. \"Lord Sondes\" was decided. Parliament subsequently passed legislation indemnifying existing bondholders and legalizing bonds of special resignation under certain regulated terms. As the presentation of Fletcher had been adjudged simoniacal, it was held to be void and the right to make the next presentation fell to the Crown; the King presented Henry Watson to the rectory. On 20 December 1830, Sondes was commissioned first major in the East Kent Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry. He was present to give homage in person at the coronation of William IV in 1831.

He is mentioned in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester along with other members of his family. He was probably the oldest son of \u00c6thelstan Half-King and succeeded to some of his father's offices in 956 when \u00c6thelstan became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. He was a benefactor of Ramsey Abbey and a supporter of the Benedictine reform movement which began in the reign of King Edgar. He was the first husband of \u00c6lfthryth who married King Edgar after \u00c6thelwald's death. William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta regum anglorum\" has a late account of \u00c6thelwald's marriage and death. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter \u00c6lfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent \u00c6thelwald to see \u00c6lfthryth, ordering him \"to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report. \" When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, \u00c6thelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this deception, and decided to repay \u00c6thelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed \u00c6thelwald. He asked \u00c6lfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed \u00c6thelwald during a hunt. Edward Augustus Freeman debunks the \u00c6thelwald murder story as a \"tissue of romance\" in his \"Historic essays\", but his arguments were in turn refuted by the naturalist William Henry Hudson in his 1920 book \"Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn\". \u00c6thelwald was seemingly dead by 962 as he ceases to witness charters at that time. He was buried at Ramsey Abbey. His younger brother \u00c6thelwine succeeded to his offices. A memorial to \u00c6thelwald, known as the Dead Man's Plack, was erected in Longparish, Hampshire in 1825.\nDocument[6](Title: Lai Lee-chiao) Lai Lee-chiao( born 15 January 1955) is a Taiwanese hurdler.

Although her ideal home was too expensive for most people in the period before World War II( 1939 \u2013 45), her work led to more efficient designs in French apartments and houses built after the war.\n\nQuestion: Who is Alexandra Of Lithuania's father-in-law?": [

He retired at Marine Barracks 8th & I on 8 September 2010.\nDocument[6](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film The Blue And White Lion?": [

Oliver was Armstrong's teacher and mentor, the latter commenting that Oliver was a pioneer in the evolution of jazz. Oliver is significant as one of those who shaped the Creole sound of New Orleans jazz. \"Snag-it\" appeared on the album of the same name by Franz Jackson, as well as on Armstrong's \"Satchmo: A Musical Autobiography\".\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died later, The Monkey Talks or Varakatnam?": [

In 1964, he hit a home run 573 feet onto- and- over the left- field roof of Chicago's Comiskey Park. While playing in Chicago and because of his towering home runs, he was known by the nickname\" Big Nick\". Nicholson had an unusual batting style, holding the bat almost over his head as he'd look out at the pitcher from underneath his arms. During his 7- year career, he struck out 573 times in 1,419 at- bats, the worst strikeout rate in Major League history. In 1963, in 126 games and 449 at- bats, Nicholson struck out an American League- leading 175 times; this would remain a single- season franchise record until Adam Dunn struck out 177 times in 2011. On May 5, 1962, Nicholson was the last batter of a no-hitter pitched by Bo Belinsky of the Los Angeles Angels against the Baltimore Orioles, popping out to third base. The Orioles had signed Nicholson and loved his potential, having seen him hit .298 for their Aberdeen, South Dakota farm club in 1959 with 35 home runs. But the strikeouts accumulated, so in January 1963, Nicholson was traded to the White Sox along with Hoyt Wilhelm, Ron Hansen, Pete Ward for longtime All- Star shortstop Luis Aparicio and outfielder Al Smith. He enjoyed his best season in the majors, producing 103 hits with a career- high 22 home runs. But his league- leading 175 strikeouts kept his position with the team in jeopardy. One of the most memorable nights of the 1964 season occurred on May 6, during a doubleheader at Comiskey Park during which Nicholson demonstrated an amazing feat of strength. In Game 1, batting against Kansas City Athletics starter Moe Drabowsky in the fifth inning, Nicholson walloped a leadoff home run that either bounced atop the left- field roof or entirely cleared it. The ball was found across the street. Howie Roberts, the team's traveling secretary, told the Associated Press: \" If it had landed on the roof, it would have a visible bruise on it. It cleared the roof.\" The home run was officially measured at 573 feet and was discussed in years to come as one of baseball's longest of all time. Nicholson homered three times in that doubleheader, another off Drabowsky in the following inning, and a shot off Aurelio Monteagudo in the first inning of Game 2. Typically of his up- and- down fortunes, Nicholson would end up hitting just 13 home runs that entire 1964 season. For his career, he played in 538 Games and had 1,419 At Bats, 184 Runs, 301 Hits, 32 Doubles, 12 Triples, 61 Home Runs, 179 RBI, 6 Stolen Bases, 219 Walks, 0.212 Batting Average, 0.318 On- base percentage, 0.381 Slugging Percentage, 540 Total Bases, four Sacrifice Hits, 12 Sacrifice Flies, and seven Intentional Walks.\n\nQuestion: Who is Infante Philip, Duke Of Calabria's paternal grandmother?": [

With the beginnings of modern biological taxonomy in the late 17th century, two opposed ideas influenced Western biological thinking: essentialism, the belief that every species has essential characteristics that are unalterable, a concept which had developed from medieval Aristotelian metaphysics, and that fit well with natural theology; and the development of the new anti-Aristotelian approach to modern science: as the Enlightenment progressed, evolutionary cosmology and the mechanical philosophy spread from the physical sciences to natural history. Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature. In the early 19th century Jean - Baptiste Lamarck (1744 -- 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution.\nDocument[2](Title: Sundori) Sundori is a 1979 Bangladeshi feature film directed by Amjad Hossain.

An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete.

Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere, and June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere. The coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in January or February in the Northern Hemisphere and in June, July or August in the Southern Hemisphere. Nighttime predominates in the winter season, and in some regions winter has the highest rate of precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation. Blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays. Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching \u2212 40 \u00b0 F (\u2212 40 \u00b0 C) due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air. They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape. The Swedish meteorological institute (SMHI) define winter as when the daily mean temperatures go below 0 \u00b0 C (32 \u00b0 F) for five consecutive days. According to the SMHI, winter in Scandinavia is more pronounced when Atlantic low -- pressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes, leaving the path open for high -- pressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur. As a result, the coldest January on record in 1987 was also the sunniest in Stockholm.\nDocument[4](Title: Campichoeta) Campichoeta are a genus of flies, and are in the family Diastatidae.\nDocument[5](Title: Lesnoye, Tver Oblast) Lesnoye is a rural locality( a\" selo\") and the administrative center of Lesnoy District of Tver Oblast, Russia.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Rick Thornberry) Rick Thornberry( born 17 February 1968) is an Australian former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2002.

In the orthohydrogen form, the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (1\u20442+1\u20442); in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (1\u20442\u20131\u20442). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, also known as the \"normal form\". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.\nDocument[6](Title: Oskar Roehler) Oskar Roehler (born 21 January 1959) is a German film director, screenwriter and journalist.

As the sources of temptation, they are viewed as in opposition to the Trinity. They are reflected in the Temptation of Christ in the desert: the world: to tempt God by casting himself off the pinnacle; the flesh: to turn stones into bread; and the devil: to worship Satan. These are the same three temptations one renounces at baptism. The roots of this triad are possibly to be found in Jesus' parable of the Sower: the three scenes of unproductive soil represent\" Satan\"( birds eating the seed), shallow and unreceptive believers( corresponding to weak\" flesh\"?), and\" the cares of the world and the lure of wealth\"( Gospel of Mark 4:15\u201317). These three are also present as a triad in the Letter to the Ephesians chapter 2, verses 1 \u20133: \" You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient. All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses ...\" Many Christian sources refer to the world, the flesh, and the devil. Peter Abelard states in his\" Expositiones\" that:\" Tria autem sunt quae nos tentant, caro, mundus, diabolus.\" Thomas Aquinas refers to the world, the flesh, and the devil in the\" Summa Theologica\". The Council of Trent sixth session, degree on justification: Nevertheless, let those who think themselves to stand, take heed lest they fall, and, with fear and trembling work out their salvation, in labours, in watchings, in almsdeeds, in prayers and oblations, in fastings and chastity: for, knowing that they are born again unto a hope of glory, but not as yet unto glory, they ought to fear for\" the combat which yet remains with the flesh, with the world, with the devil\", wherein they can not be victorious, unless they be with God's grace, obedient to the Apostle, who says; We are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live. The phrase may have entered popular use in English through the Book of Common Prayer, which includes in its Litany:\"[ F] rom al the deceytes of the worlde, the fleshe, and the deuill: Good lorde deliuer us.\" John of the Cross cites the world, the flesh, and the devil as threats to the perfection of the soul, and offers different\" precautions\" to be taken against each of these. Some have responded to the idea of temptation by teaching or practicing asceticism; see also ascetical theology and mortification of the flesh. The question of whether the world and the flesh are inherently bad and what the individual's proper relationship to them ought to be has long been debated in many philosophical and spiritual traditions.\nDocument[2](Title: Love Affair (1939 film)) Love Affair is a 1939 American romantic film starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer and featuring Maria Ouspenskaya.

Initially he was a cup-bearer of Mieszko II and the governor of Masovia. However, an internal crisis and a pagan reaction led to the exile of Mieszko and rule of Bezprym. This weakened the Piast overlordship over Masovia. Initially, Mieszko's successor, Casimir I, did not have enough power to reunite the country and the region succumbed into chaos. The pagan reaction in Masovia was particularly strong and it is assumed that Miec\u0142aw, having achieved delegated authority in Masovia under Mieszko, simply took advantage of the difficult situation to increase his rights or become independent. However, Casimir I in 1039 was supported by Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor against the Bohemians and soon afterwards he also concluded an alliance with Kievan Rus.

Reinald IV became the second Duke of Guelders and J\u00fclich upon his brother William's death in 1402 without heirs. Reinald, in conjunction with the Wittelsbach Counts of Holland, Hainaut and Zeeland, tried in vain to slow the emergence of Burgundy in the Netherlands area and in 1406 was unable to enforce old claims against Burgundy to Brabant-Limburg. He allied himself with Rupert, King of Germany, supporting his coronation in Aachen and remained closely connected with the House of Orl\u00e9ans. In 1407, Reinald supported his brother-in-law, John of Arkel, against the Dutch and in 1409 received the city of Gorinchem from John. This started a new feud with Holland which ended in 1412 when Reinald ceded Gorinchem for a large sum of money. He also conceded the city of Emmerich as a result of an earlier promise to the Duke of Cleves. Reinald led the traditional feuds of his House, particularly those against the Bishops of Utrecht and against Holland and Friesland. He occupied Arkel, but in 1422 he was forced to seek peace and return all of his conquests. Reinald also stood against the House of Cleves in the Niederrhein area and maintained a lot of influence over Guelders. On 5 May 1405, Reinald married Marie of Harcourt, daughter of John VI, Count of Harcourt. Reinald died near Arnhem on 25 June 1423 and was buried at Kloster Monkhuizen. As Reinald died without legitimate issue, the Duchy of J\u00fclich descended to Adolf, Duke of Berg, son of Reinald's cousin William VII of J\u00fclich, 1st Duke of Berg. In 1426, Reinald's widow married Adolf's son Rupert, but he died in 1431 without heirs and the Duchy of J\u00fclich-Berg then descended to Adolf's nephew Gerhard. The Duchy of Guelders descended to Reinald's great-nephew, Arnold of Egmond, although the House of J\u00fclich fought unsuccessfully against the House of Egmond for this title.\nDocument[6](Title: Seehamer See) Seehamer See is a lake in the Alpine foothills, Bavaria, Germany.

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.\nDocument[6](Title: Rough and Ready (film)) Rough and Ready is a 1918 American silent western film directed by Richard Stanton and produced and distributed by the Fox Film Corporation.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Samarpane?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[4](Title: Nova Zembla (film)) Nova Zembla is a 2011 Dutch historical drama film directed by Reinout Oerlemans.

He was born in Brignoles, into an artistic family that produced fourteen painters over six generations. His grandfather Georges Parrocel (1540- ca. 1614) (no surviving works) and his father Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1595\u20131660) were both painters. One badly restored painting of Bath\u00e9lemy survives in the church of Saint-Sauveur in Brignoles, France. His brothers Jean Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1631\u20131653) (no surviving works) and Louis Parrocel (1634\u20131694) also became painters. He was soon noticed He was only thirteen years old when his father died in 1660. His elder brother Louis, who was already established as a painter in the Languedoc, took him under his care and gave him a training as painter. Three years later he ran away from his brother's house to Marseilles. His talent as a painter became soon noticed and he got a commission for a number of paintings with scenes of the life of Saint Anthony of Padua for the church Saint-Martin. But he only executed two of them. it is also possible that he painted them during his second stay in the Provence. He left for Paris and stayed there for four years, perfecting his skills. He then returned to the Provence and continued his journey to Italy, where he would stay for eight years. In Rome he became the pupil of Jacques Courtois, a famous painter of battle scenes who was also known als \"le Bourguignon\" or \"il Borgognone\". He also studied the works of Salvator Rosa, an unorthodox proto-Romantic painter. Joseph Parrocel worked with him in his workshop and was thoroughly influenced by him, even if he gave his style later a more French touch. Parrocel then started a journey through Italy and finally arrived in Venice. He was planning to settle in this town but after eight brigands had attempted to murder him on the Rialto Bridge, he left Italy in disgust. He settled in Paris in 1675 and earned himself a reputation. He was accepted as an elected member at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 29 February 1676 and he became an academician on 14 November 1676 with his admission piece \"Siege of Maastricht\". In 1703 he became a councillor at the Academy. As a member of the Academy, he would obtain royal commissions. However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and the Palace of Versailles. During his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings. He died, aged 57, in Paris. He is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also landscapes, historical pieces and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the H\u00f4tel de Soubise and the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of the \"f\u00eates galantes\" of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes. His differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours. During his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University). Joseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690\u20131774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688\u20131752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667\u20131722) and Pierre (1670\u20131739), who both became painters and engravers.

The main character, Alice, hypothesizes,\" Mad as a March hare\" is a common British English phrase, both now and in Carroll's time, and appears in John Heywood's collection of proverbs published in 1546. It is reported in\" The Annotated Alice\" by Martin Gardner that this proverb is based on popular belief about hares' behaviour at the beginning of the long breeding season, which lasts from February to September in Britain. Early in the season, unreceptive females often use their forelegs to repel overenthusiastic males. It used to be incorrectly believed that these bouts were between males fighting for breeding supremacy. Like the character's friend, the Hatter, the March Hare feels compelled to always behave as though it is tea- time because the Hatter supposedly\" murdered the time\" whilst singing for the Queen of Hearts. Sir John Tenniel's illustration also shows him with straw on his head, a common way to depict madness in Victorian times. The March Hare later appears at the trial for the Knave of Hearts, and for a final time as\" Haigha\"( which is pronounced to rhyme with\" mayor\", according to Carroll, and a homophone of\" hare\" in a non-rhotic accent), the personal messenger to the White King in\" Through the Looking- Glass\"( Alice either does not recognize him as the March Hare of her earlier dream, or chooses not to comment about this).\nDocument[4](Title: Park Seung-jung) Park Seung- jung is a South Korean cardiologist.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[4](Title: Gerry (2002 film)) Gerry is a 2002 American drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant and starring and co-written by Matt Damon and Casey Affleck.

Eldest daughter of King Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma, she was married in May 1785 aged 10 with Infante John, Lord of the Infantado and Duke of Beja, second son of Queen Maria I of Portugal, in an attempt to cement ties between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal.

They are the producers in a food chain, such as plants on land or algae in water (in contrast to heterotrophs as consumers of autotrophs). They do not need a living source of energy or organic carbon. Autotrophs can reduce carbon dioxide to make organic compounds for biosynthesis and also create a store of chemical energy. Most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent, but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. Some autotrophs, like green plants and algae, are phototrophs, meaning that they convert electromagnetic energy from sunlight into chemical energy in the form of reduced carbon.\nDocument[2](Title: Achacha District) Achacha is a district situated within Mostaganem Province, lying on the Mediterranean Sea, northern Algeria.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities. The Saverne Affair was vivid in the memory among the Alsatians.\nDocument[2](Title: Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus) Independently of Castello and Coup, James Anthony Bailey had teamed up with James E.

The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000\u2013100,000 years.\n\nQuestion: Are both Lise Kristiansen and Bernt Lund from the same country?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: We Are Young.

Between 1972 and 2015, he directed ten theatrically released feature films, six of which he wrote. He has been involved in numerous television projects as director, writer, producer and animator. Beginning his career at the Terrytoons television cartoon studio as a cel polisher, Bakshi was eventually promoted to animator, and then director.

Ivy Tech Community College, 853 F.3d 339 (7th Cir. 2017), was a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in which the Court held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ruling made the Seventh Circuit the first federal appeals court to find that sexual orientation is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Educator Kimberly Hively sued Ivy Tech Community College for employment discrimination in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, alleging that Ivy Tech had unlawfully discriminated on the basis of her sexual orientation. The District Court dismissed the lawsuit, holding that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit, but the Seventh Circuit judges voted to rehear the case \"en banc\", before all 11 judges of the Court of Appeals. Writing for the 8\u20133 majority, Chief Judge Diane Wood held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Wood wrote that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex, because if an employer discriminates on the basis of sex, a man in a relationship with a woman would not be discriminated against, but a woman in a relationship with a woman would be. Additionally, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in \"Loving v. Virginia\", Wood wrote that discrimination on the basis of a person's partner's sex is tantamount to discrimination on the basis of sex. After the Seventh Circuit's ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit published a contradictory opinion in \"Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital\", ruling that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\nDocument[3](Title: Saddle Mountain, Oklahoma) Saddle Mountain is an unincorporated community in Kiowa County, Oklahoma, United States, along State Highway 115.

A standalone sequel to\" Final Destination 2\"( 2003), it is the third installment in the\" Final Destination\" film series. Wong and Glen Morgan, who worked on the franchise's first film, wrote the screenplay. \" Final Destination 3\" stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, and takes place five years after the first film. Winstead plays Wendy Christensen, a high school graduate who has a premonition that a roller coaster she and her classmates are riding will derail. Although she saves some of them, Death begins hunting the survivors. Wendy realizes photographs she took at the amusement park contain clues about her classmates' death. Allies with another survivor and friend Kevin Fischer( Merriman), Wendy tries to use this knowledge to save the rest of them and to ruin Death's scheme. The film's development began shortly after the release of\" Final Destination 2\"; Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for the third one. Unlike the second film, which was a direct sequel to the first, the producers envisioned\" Final Destination 3\" as a stand- alone film. The idea of featuring a roller coaster derailment as the opening- scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan saw control as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005 and concluded in April. Like the previous two installments, it was filmed in Vancouver, Canada. The first two weeks of the three- month shoot were spent filming the roller coaster's derailment. Following its premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on February 2, 2006, the film was released in cinemas in the United States on February 10, 2006. The DVD, released on July 25, 2006, includes commentaries, documentaries, a deleted scene and an animated video. A special- edition DVD called\" Thrill Ride Edition\" includes a feature called\" Choose Their Fate\", which acts as an interactive film, allowing viewers to make decisions at specific points in the film that alter the course of the story. \" Final Destination 3\" received a mixed critical response. Some critics called the film formulaic and said it brought nothing new to the franchise, while others praised it for being enjoyable and fulfilling its audience's expectations. Two death scenes involving tanning beds and a nail gun, respectively, as well as Winstead's performance attracted positive comments from reviewers. The film was a financial success and, with box office receipts of nearly$ 118 million, the highest- grossing installment in the franchise at the time.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Joseph A.

He was the oldest son of Henry I the Fowler and Matilda. Otto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father's death in 936. He continued his father's work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king's powers at the expense of the aristocracy. Through strategic marriages and personal appointments, Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom's most important duchies. This reduced the various dukes, who had previously been co-equals with the king, to royal subjects under his authority. Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen royal authority and subjected its clergy to his personal control. After putting down a brief civil war among the rebellious duchies, Otto defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, thus ending the Hungarian invasions of Western Europe. The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto a reputation as a savior of Christendom and secured his hold over the kingdom. By 961, Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy. The patronage of Otto and his immediate successors facilitated a so-called \"Ottonian Renaissance\" of arts and architecture. Following the example of Charlemagne's coronation as \"Emperor of the Romans\" in 800, Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962 by Pope John XII in Rome. Otto's later years were marked by conflicts with the papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy. Reigning from Rome, Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire, which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm's further expansion to the south. To resolve this conflict, the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son Otto II in April 972. Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in May 973.

Tomalski was a technology journalist: he founded\" Home Cinema Choice\" magazine and contributed to many other magazines on the subjects of TV, video, satellite TV, mobile phones and camcorders. He also appeared regularly on Sky News' weekly\" Technofile\" programme, reviewing gadgets alongside presenter Martin Stanford. He was also a regular contributor to\" Media Network\", a communications magazine on the English service of Radio Netherlands. Tomalski started his broadcasting career on the south west London pirate scene of the 1970s, where he became best known as the host of Roger Tate's Mailbox Show on European Music Radio, later becoming a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign G6CQF. His maisonette in Mitcham, Surrey was equipped with a broadcast- quality mixing desk and two Nakamichi cassette decks, alongside the high- quality turntables. These were complemented by a collection of several thousand albums, mainly of his favourite genre; soul and funk, but topped up with many chart albums and a few hundred 60s and 70s rock records. He was also a collector of state of the art video equipment. He was a co-founder of Wandle Valley Radio( WVR) in 1984, still under the pseudonym\" Roger Tate\", broadcasting a soul/ funk/ hi-energy programme- he was a friend of the hi-energy artist Hazell Dean- alongside Alan Rogers and Paul James( both pseudonyms for obvious reasons). He provided the studio facilities for the station, which was amongst the pioneers of microwave links from the studio to the FM Band II transmitter, a technology later very widely used in pirate radio. Another technology which Tomalski pioneered was that of computer data transmission via Band II FM radio- raw data transmitted onto the audio signal with no subcarrier: WVR featured the\" Roger Tate Computer Program Programme\" with Tomalski introducing( after the music had ended for the night) half an hour of 8- bit data sounds played from a Nakamichi cassette deck, representing programs for the BBC Micro and the Tandy TRS- 80 microcomputers, among others. Surprisingly, for such an innovation being broadcast into listeners homes late at night, the telephone and postal feedback on the programme was overwhelmingly positive; a tribute to Tomalski's broadcasting skills. His home studio was raided in the late 80s after alleged transmission offences, and the Home Office even went as far as confiscating his electric kettle( as well as the studio gear), on the grounds that it was connected to the same ring main as his transmitting equipment. In his subsequent radio career, Tomalski was a regular contributor to\" You and Yours\" and\" The Big Byte\" on BBC Radio. He also broadcast for Radio Mercury and Radio Invicta( which also sparked the career of Steve Walsh), and was the resident' Inspector Gadget' on the LBC\" Weekend Wireless Show\", talking about the week's technology news, reviewing gadgets and answering listener queries.\nDocument[6](Title: Florian Pumh\u00f6sl) Florian Pumh\u00f6sl (born 1971) is an artist based in Vienna, mainly known for his works that employ abstract visual language to reflect on the diverse manifestations of modernity.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died later, Swarg Narak or Antardhan?": [

Starting immediately after the cacophony that ends \"21st Century Schizoid Man\", the mood of this song is a stark contrast; it is serene, simple and peaceful. Ian McDonald's flute begins the song, and is one of the lead instruments throughout. He also plays a classical-inspired solo in the middle of the song as a \"C\" section and a longer one at the end as a coda. These themes would be revisited by the band, notably on their second album, \"In the Wake of PoseidonPictures of a City\", with a similar mood as \"21st Century Schizoid Man\", would be followed by \"Cadence and Cascade\", another calm song, and the second album's title track also mirrors \"Epitaph\" in some aspects as well, both of which end side one. This song is the only song on \" In the Court of the Crimson King\" that does not have at least one separately titled section. An earlier demo version of this song may be found on the now out-of-print LP \"A Young Person's Guide to King Crimson\", which featured Robert Fripp (guitar), Peter Giles (bass), Michael Giles (drums), and Ian McDonald (flute), along with Judy Dyble (formerly of Fairport Convention) on vocals.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Sammy Baloji) Sammy Baloji is a photographer from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.\nDocument[2](Title: Goose Lake (Washington)) Goose Lake, in the U.S. state of Washington, is located within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Mark \"Pelli\" Pellizzer) Mark Pellizzer (born June 14, 1980), better known by his stage name Mark Pelli, is a Canadian musician, singer, songwriter and record producer.

After publishing the very influential\" The Rise of the West\"( 1963) and\" Plagues and Peoples\"( 1976), McNeill published an essay called, \u201c How the Potato Changed the World \u2019s History \u201d in 1999.

Morgan) Ephraim Franklin Morgan (January 16, 1869January 15, 1950) was born on a farm near Forksburg, Marion County, West Virginia, a descendant of the first white settler of western Virginia, Morgan Morgan, and his son David Morgan. He studied at Fairmont State Normal School and graduated from the West Virginia University law school in 1897. After establishing a law practice in Fairmont, Morgan enlisted in the First West Virginia Infantry during the Spanish\u2013American War. Following the war, he became the Fairmont city attorney. He served as a judge of the Marion County Intermediate Court from 1907 to 1912 and as a member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission from 1915 to 1920. In 1902, he married Alma Bennett. At the time Morgan became governor, a virtual state of war existed between union coal miners and coal operators. The United Mine Workers union was protesting for the right to organize miners in the southwestern part of the state. In late summer 1921, the governor called upon President Warren G. Harding to dispatch federal troops to end an armed miners' march in Boone and Logan counties. After the conflict ended, Morgan used National Guard troops to discourage miners from again taking up arms. A more detailed discussion of the 1921 armed miners' march and the Battle of Blair Mountain can be found in Clayton D. Laurie's \"The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920\u20131921\" in \"West Virginia History\", Volume 50 (1991).

Another theory holds that the island found by da Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, 2,430 kilometres (1,510 mi) to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships attached to the squadron of Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama expedition on 30 July 1503 (as reported in the account of clerk Thom\u00e9 Lopes). However, a paper published in 2015 reviewed the discovery date and dismissed the 18 August as too late for da Nova to make a discovery and then return to Lisbon by 11 September 1502, whether he sailed from St Helena or Tristan da Cunha. It demonstrates the 21 May is probably a Protestant rather than Catholic or Orthodox feast-day, first quoted in 1596 by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, who was probably mistaken because the island was discovered several decades before the Reformation and start of Protestantism. The alternative discovery date of 3 May, the Catholic feast-day for the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, quoted by Odoardo Duarte Lopes and Sir Thomas Herbert is suggested as being historically more credible.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film Foma Gordeyev (Film)?": [

Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities.

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent film era. At the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney\" the best there has ever been\". Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles,\" National Velvet\" and\" The Human Comedy\", said he was\" the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\". Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played Puck in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of\" A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as\" one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in\" Boys Town\". At 19, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in\" Babes in Arms\", and he was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award in 1939. At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer's most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer. Rooney was the top box- office attraction from 1939 to 1941 and one of the best- paid actors of that era, but his career would never again rise to such heights. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well- received supporting roles in films such as\" Breakfast at Tiffany's\"( 1961),\" Requiem for a Heavyweight\"( 1962),\" It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\"( 1963), and\" The Black Stallion\"( 1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in\" Sugar Babies\" and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an Emmy in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in\" Bill\"( 1981).\nDocument[6](Title: Robert Dillon, 3rd Baron Clonbrock) Robert Dillon, 3rd Baron Clonbrock (29 March 1807 \u2013 4 December 1893), was an Irish peer.

Its rulers, called counts, had a special and privileged standing in the Empire. The County of Cleves was first mentioned in the 11th century. In 1417, the county became a duchy, and its rulers were raised to the status of Dukes. Its history is closely related to that of its neighbours: the Duchies of J\u00fclich, Berg and Guelders and the County of Mark. In 1368, Cleves and Mark were united. In 1521 J\u00fclich, Berg, Cleves and Mark formed the United Duchies of J\u00fclich- Cleves- Berg. The territory was situated on both sides of the river Rhine, around its capital Cleves and roughly covering today's districts of Cleves, Wesel and the city of Duisburg. He married Margaret, daughter of Floris III, Count of Holland, and his wife Ada of Huntingdon. According to the German, Dutch and French Wikipedia there was only one Dietrich between 1172 and 1198. This Dietrich was the son of Dietrich II and Adelaide of Sulzbach and was married to Margaret of Holland.

Composed by Beyonc\u00e9, Jeff Bhasker, Luke Steele, the song's development was motivated by the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 wanted a song that would help people through both their painful and happy moments. \" Rather Die Young\" is an R&B-soul power ballad that is instrumentally complete with synthesizers, a piano, a strummy guitar, and heavy drums, which were inspired by the work of the American band Earth, Wind & Fire. Lyrically, the song talks about the inability to fight what the heart wants. The female protagonist sings to an indifferent love interest, whom she likens to American actor James Dean and tells him that she prefers to die rather than live without him. \" Rather Die Young\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics who described it as a dark, yet enchanting ballad.

Critics also noted that the ballad was heavily influenced by the 1980s R&B and soul music, adding that it has a Philadelphia soul vibe.

He was also a Knight Templar. William was the son of Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby, and his wife, Margaret Peverel. He succeeded his father as Earl of Derby in 1162. He was married to Sybil, the daughter of William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, and Bertha of Hereford.\nDocument[6](Title: Charles Sanders Peirce) Charles Sanders Peirce (September 10, 1839 \u2013 April 19, 1914) was an American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist who is sometimes known as \"the father of pragmatism\". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism. An innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. Additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers. In 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce \"the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logicianWebster's Biographical Dictionary\" said in 1943 that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time\". Keith Devlin similarly referred to Peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of William De Ferrers, 4Th Earl Of Derby?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Piyal Wijetunge) Piyal Kashyapa Wijetunge( born August 6, 1971, Badulla) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played in one Test in 1993.

Designed by architect James Lake Parkinson in a Carpenter Gothic style, the building is one of 25 stations built of the 1882 life- saving type. It is also one of six still in existence in the country. Construction on the facility began in September 1885 and was completed in the following year. There were two earlier stations in the northern end of Ocean City before this facility was constructed, and there were two stations farther south on the island. At 4th Street and Atlantic Avenue, the life- saving station was originally near the beach, but sand gradually accumulated, such that it is currently about from the coast. In December 1936, the facility was shut down in favor of the larger Great Egg Coast Guard Station, across Great Egg Harbor Inlet. The United States Coast Guard continued to own the property, utilizing it during World War II to store equipment and personnel who patrolled the beach for German submarines and spies. In October 1945, the Coast Guard sold the life- saving station, and for 54 years the building served as a private residence. From 1999 to 2010, a developer sought to demolish the building in favor of constructing three duplexes. After legal battles and intervention from local historic groups, Ocean City purchased the property in May 2010. After a$ 1.5 million renovation, the life- saving station reopened on December 31, 2017, and six months later reopened as the Ocean City Life- Saving Museum.\nDocument[4](Title: James Whale) James Whale (22 July 1889 \u2013 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theater director and actor, who spent the greater part of his career in Hollywood. He is best remembered for several horror films: \"Frankenstein\" (1931), \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical \"Show Boat\". He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, and many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. Whale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play \"Journey's End\" led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from \"Journey's End\" (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera. At the height of his career as a director Whale directed \"The Road Back\" (1937), a sequel to \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool. Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career.\nDocument[5](Title: Julian von Schleinitz) Julian von Schleinitz( born September 19, 1991 in Germany) is a German luge athlete who represents his nation in the men's singles luge event in international competition.

The first two centuries of the empire's existence were a period of unprecedented political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, or ``Roman Peace ''. Following Octavian's victory, the size of the empire was dramatically increased. After the assassination of Caligula in AD 41, the Senate briefly considered restoring the republic, but the Praetorian Guard proclaimed Claudius emperor instead. Under Claudius, the empire invaded Britannia, its first major expansion since Augustus. After Claudius' successor, Nero, committed suicide in AD 68, the empire suffered a series of brief civil wars, as well as a concurrent major rebellion in Judea, during which four different legionary generals were proclaimed emperor. Vespasian emerged triumphant in AD 69, establishing the Flavian dynasty, before being succeeded by his son Titus, who opened the Colosseum shortly after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. His short reign was followed by the long reign of his brother Domitian, who was eventually assassinated. The Senate then appointed the first of the Five Good Emperors. The empire reached its greatest extent under Trajan, the second in this line.\nDocument[3](Title: Brothers and Sisters, Are You Ready?)

The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Kahlik Bolaghi) Kahlik Bolaghi may refer to:\nDocument[3](Title: Frederick T. van Beuren Jr.) Frederick T. van Beuren Jr., M.D. (February 10, 1876 \u2013 March 13, 1943) was a physician and surgeon, a medical school administrator and professor, a researcher, and a hospital administrator.

A genius.\" On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz.

The world's first international telegraph connection under the sea, a link from Dover to Calais in 1851, used a cable made by the company. Except for a few early ones, submarine cables were armoured with iron, then later steel, wires. The Gutta Percha Company made only the insulated cores, not the complete cable, until 1864 when it merged in to the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, The Affairs Of Martha or The Football Lottery?": [

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Bodily Harm (Film)?": [

It was founded in 1973 by eight artists( Martin Bartlett, Mo van Nostrand, Kate Craig, Henry Greenhow, Glenn Lewis, Eric Metcalfe, Michael Morris, Vincent Trasov) who wanted to create a space for the exploration and creation of new art forms. After they purchased the former Knights of Pythias lodge hall located in Mount Pleasant, Vancouver, it quickly became a centre for poets, dancers, musicians and visual artists interested in exploration and interdisciplinary practices. Many of the Western Front's early works reflect this interdisciplinary ethos with early influences of Duchampian and Fluxus- based investigations into mail art, telecommunications art, live electronic music, video and performance art. Western Front also supported a number of political and activist projects- in one of their most famous performance pieces, founding member Vincent Trasov adopted the personality of Mr. Peanut, gave a number of performances and in 1974 ran for mayor of Vancouver. Mr. Peanut was so highly regarded that he was picked by The Vancouver Sun as one of the province's 100 most influential people as the end of the millennium approached in 1999. As a focal point of experimental art practice through the 1970s and 1980s, the Western Front, in connection with other centres like it, played a major role in the development of electronic and networked art forms in a national and international context. Over its nearly 40- year history the Western Front has promoted critical investigations into and surrounding interdisciplinary, media- based, anti-object, and ephemeral practices with particular attention to the contexts and economies in which art is produced. While general curatorial priorities have remained dedicated to these practices, the Western Front's internal structure has continued to evolve and a number of distinct programs have been established and retired over the years including Performance Art, Movement Arts, Literary Arts and\" Front Magazine\". The Western Front still continues to program events and exhibitions related to these genres, but no longer supports fully dedicated departments. The Western Front continues to maintain programs in Media Art, New Music, and Exhibitions.

He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history. His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their realism, dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music. Kubrick was raised in the Bronx, New York City, and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. He received average grades, but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for \"Look\" magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, \"The Killing\", for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas, the war picture \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) and the historical epic \"Spartacus\" (1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself. Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of the Hollywood industry, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964). A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of  (1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation's \"big bang\", and it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. For the 18th-century period film \"Barry Lyndon\" (1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA, to film scenes under natural candlelight. With \"The Shining\" (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots. While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release\u2014particularly \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy\u2014most were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and underwent critical reevaluations. His last film, \"Eyes Wide Shut\", was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70.\nDocument[3](Title: Chakkarpur) Chakkarpur is a big village in Gurgaon city of Haryana, India.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Abdul Ali Lalu) AFM Abdul Ali Lalu( 20 October 1932 \u2013 21 July 2008) was a Bangladeshi film and television actor mostly in a comedic role.

Cornwallis-West was born into an upper-class Irish family as the daughter of the Rev. Frederick, a descendant of Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 1st Baron Upper Ossory and Lady Olivia FitzPatrick, daughter of Thomas Taylour, 2nd Marquess of Headfort. Her mother unsuccessfully attempted to seduce Albert, Prince Consort, and Cornwallis-West herself became mistress of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) at the age of 16. The affair was discovered and she was married to the twice older William Cornwallis-West in 1872. Three children were born to Mary and William Cornwallis-West: a daughter named Daisy in 1873, a son named George the following year and finally Constance in 1876. Cornwallis-West became notorious for using her influence over the Prince of Wales to arrange marriages for her children, particularly the marriage of her younger daughter to the wealthy Duke of Westminster. In 1915, she began a relationship with a much younger shell-shocked soldier, Patrick Barrett, nursed in the Duchess of Westminster's hospital in Le Touquet. Her attempts to have the soldier promoted within the army caused a scandal. She was widowed in 1917 and died three years later.\nDocument[3](Title: I Musici de Montr\u00e9al Chamber Orchestra) I Musici de Montr\u00e9al is a Canadian chamber orchestra.

He began his vocal studies in his native city in 1814 and made his stage debut there in 1821. He quickly made a specialty of Rossini roles, singing in\" Il barbiere di SivigliaTancrediLa cenerentola La gazza ladraSemiramide\", etc. He created for Donizetti the roles of Olivo in\" Olivo e Pasquale\" in 1827, and of Azzo in\" Parisina\" in 1833, also creating the role of Arnoldo in Pacini's\" Carlo di Borgogna\", in 1835. Cosselli was one of the first singers to make the transition between the old conception of the bass vocal range to what we know today as the baritone, a voice type that was still in its infancy. For Donizetti again, he created the role of Enrico in the highly successful\" Lucia di Lammermoor\", at the San Carlo in Naples, in 1835, giving to the role a new dramatic dimension, looking forward to what was to become known as the Verdi-baritone; the standard published score of Lucia contains several downward transpositions which mask the consistently high tessitura of the role as written for Cosselli. He went on singing the florid bass roles of Rossini such as Mos\u00e8, Maometto, Assur, etc.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Neil Lloyd Macky or Domenico Cosselli?": [

He also collaborated to the re-creation of\" M\u00e2rouf, savetier du Caire\", at the Opera of Marseille, and to the production of\" La jolie fille de Perth\" in Compi\u00e8gne( France). Thanks to his stage presence and his acting skills, he achieved great success in the operetta repertoire, performing the roles of Brissac,(\" Les mousquetaires au couvent\"), to great acclaim in Toulouse, le Vice- roi du P\u00e9rou(\" la P\u00e9richole\") in Marseille and Nancy, and especially Danilo,(\" La veuve joyeuse\") in Montr\u00e9al, Bordeaux, Li\u00e8ge and Lausanne. Though a noted performer of the French opera repertoire, Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Lapointe also made his mark in the Italian and Russian repertoire: he sang Figaro(\" Le Barbier de Seville\") at the Op\u00e9ra Com\u00e9die, Count Almaviva(\" Les Noces de Figaro\") in Nancy and Don Giovanni in Trieste.

It was produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille from a screenplay by Harold Lamb, Edwin Justus Mayer and C. Gardner Sullivan adapted by Jeanie Macpherson from the novel\" Lafitte the Pirate\" by Lyle Saxon. The music score was by George Antheil and the cinematography by Victor Milner. The film stars Fredric March as Lafitte, Franciska Gaal and Akim Tamiroff with Margot Grahame, Walter Brennan, Ian Keith, Spring Byington, Douglass Dumbrille, Beulah Bondi and Anthony Quinn in supporting roles. It is one of the few pre -1950 sound films by Paramount to remain under that studio's ownership( partly so the remake could be filmed), whereas most films from that era had been sold to EMKA, Ltd. \u2013 now part of NBCUniversal Television Distribution \u2013 in the early television era. Cecil B. DeMille remade the film in 1958 in Technicolor and VistaVision with the same title, but because of ill health, he allowed Henry Wilcoxon, his longtime friend and associate, to produce it, and the film was directed by Anthony Quinn, who was his son -in- law at the time. De Mille received no screen credit, but did make a personal appearance in the prologue to the film, much as he did in\" The Ten Commandments\". The 1958 version of\" The Buccaneer\" stars Yul Brynner, Charles Boyer and Claire Bloom, with Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson. Douglass Dumbrille appeared in both versions and Quinn acted in the earlier version.\n\nQuestion: Who is Sobe (Sister Of Saint Anne)'s grandchild?": [

Born 1 August 1365 at Epworth in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire, John de Mowbray was the elder son of John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray, and Elizabeth Segrave. He had a younger brother, Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, and three sisters, Eleanor, Margaret and Joan( for details concerning his siblings, see the article on his father, John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray). He was styled' cousin' by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. At the death of his mother in 1368, Mowbray is said to have become Baron Segrave. However he had little financial benefit from his inheritance as a result of the very large jointure which had been awarded to Elizabeth Segrave's mother, Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, who lived until 1399. In 1368 he also succeeded to the barony of Mowbray when his father was slain by the Turks near Constantinople while en route to the Holy Land. In April 1372, custody of both John and his brother Thomas was granted to Blanche Wake, a sister of their grandmother, Joan of Lancaster. On 23 April 1377, he was knighted in company with the future Richard II and the future Henry IV when the latter two noblemen were made Knights of the Bath. When Richard II was crowned on 16 July 1377, Mowbray was created Earl of Nottingham. As joint tenants of the estates of William Beauchamp of Bedford, he and William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer successfully claimed the right to serve as Almoner at the coronation. Mowbray died before 12 February 1383, aged seventeen and unmarried, and was buried at the Whitefriars in Fleet Street, London. The earldom of Nottingham became extinct at his death. He was succeeded in the barony of Mowbray by his younger brother, Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who subsequently became Earl of Nottingham on 12 January 1386 by a new creation of the earldom.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is the director of film The Mexican Dream?": [

His rule was confined to the western half, as eastern Mercia was then part of the Viking- ruled Danelaw. \u00c6thelred's ancestry is unknown. He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881, and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. The alliance was cemented by the marriage of \u00c6thelred to Alfred's daughter \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. In 886 Alfred took possession of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; as it had traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to \u00c6thelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year \u00c6thelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, \u00c6thelred's health may have declined, and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d may have become the effective ruler of Mercia. After \u00c6thelred's death, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Breed Of The Border (1924 Film)?": [

Born in Gro\u00dfenhain, Saxony, under the name Friedrich Traugott Pursh, he was educated at Dresden Botanical Gardens, and emigrated to the United States in 1799.

In 1805, he traveled south from Maryland to the Carolinas and, in 1806, he traveled north from the mountains of Pennsylvania to New Hampshire. He made both trips principally on foot, with only his dog and a gun, covering over three thousand miles each season.

It spread outward from Imerina, the Central Highlands region primarily inhabited by the Merina ethnic group with a spiritual capital at Ambohimanga and a political capital west at Antananarivo, currently the seat of government for the modern state of Madagascar. The Merina kings and queens who ruled over greater Madagascar in the 19th century were the descendants of a long line of hereditary Merina royalty originating with Andriamanelo, who is traditionally credited with founding Imerina in 1540.\nDocument[3](Title: J\u00falio Santos (athlete)) J\u00falio Santos( born 30 May 1936) is a Portuguese athlete.

He is an original character and does not appear in the television series, and should not be confused with the character of the same name from the serial\" Ghost Light\"( 1989). Nimrod works for the Forge, a top- secret organization responsible for experimenting with extraterrestrial material. During World War I Dr William Abberton was responsible for genetic experiments on vampire DNA \u2014 the so- called\" Project: Twilight\" \u2014 creating a hybrid race to act as super- soldiers. However, when the hybrids escaped, Abberton was mortally injured, only saving himself by injecting himself with the Twilight Virus, turning himself into a hybrid as well. He took the code name Nimrod, after the legendary hunter king, and hunted down the survivors of his vampire experiments. Over the years, he endured genetic alterations to stabilize his condition, even getting several cybernetic implants. Years later, he replaced Colonel Crichton as Deputy Director of the Forge. He first met the Sixth Doctor and Evelyn Smythe in 1999, while tracking down the last of the vampires to a casino called\" Dusk\". Evelyn befriended a girl who worked there called Cassie. Cassie had left her son Tommy with his grandmother up north while Cassie tried to earn a good living in London. But the vampires turned her into one of their own and she was the only one of them to escape when Nimrod destroyed the Dusk. He eventually found her in Norway, where the Doctor had left her while he tried to create a cure. He brainwashed her and made her his replacement field agent, Artemis. He then began work on\" Project: Lazarus\", a plan to create clones of the Doctor to discover the secrets of Time Lord regeneration. Once the Doctor had created a cure for the Twilight Virus, he and Evelyn returned to administer it to Cassie a few years later. But Nimrod captured the Doctor, took samples from his body and murdered Cassie before she could be cured. After the Doctor escaped, Nimrod started work on the cloning process, and succeeded in creating multiple identical versions of the Sixth Doctor. He clinically murdered many of them, but they all failed to regenerate. They were each short lived, but he kept them as a sort of pet, one at a time, dressing them like the real Doctor and tricking them into being his Scientific Adviser. After a few years of this, the Seventh Doctor arrived at the Forge and revealed the truth to his clone. Enraged by this, the replica Doctor destroyed the Forge. Nimrod escaped, but he believed it was the real Doctor that obliterated the facility. Although their building was gone, the Forge continued. They re-branded themselves as the public face of alien encounters. Even Nimrod became a public figure, now calling himself Sir William Abberton. But in 2026 a deadly alien mutagen escaped from the Forge, forcing most of London to be evacuated. The Seventh Doctor arrived in the middle of this emergency, but he was younger than the version that saw the destruction of the Forge two decades previously. With the Doctor were his companions Ace and Hex. Nimrod already knew that Hex was Cassie's son, now a grown man. He played on Hex's doubts and fears and confusion to drive a wedge between him and the Doctor. He even convinced Hex to resurrect the remains of his mother, but she returned as a monstrous zombie. However, her instincts were retained and she quickly turned on Nimrod and killed him. Meanwhile, the Forge was overthrown by his second in command, Captain Aristedes, whose initial hostility at the Doctor for his role in the destruction of the Forge shifted to Nimrod when the Doctor devised a cure for the mutagen that Nimrod explicitly modified to kill the victims rather than cure them. Aristedes thus implemented\" Project: Destiny\", and Nimrod and the Forge were destroyed. The book contains the short story\" Twilight's End\". The new Forge skyscraper was the most scientifically advanced building in the world, but it was hardwired to the remains of Nimrod, kept in a sealed vault deep below the property. The Seventh Doctor arrives, leaving a syringe containing the Twilight Cure, giving Nimrod the choice to use it.\nDocument[5](Title: Place of birth) The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[6](Title: Don't Ever Open That Door) Do n't Ever Open That Door( Spanish: No abras nunca esa puerta) is a 1952 Argentine thriller film directed by Carlos Hugo Christensen and starring \u00c1ngel Magana, Roberto Escalada and Norma Gim\u00e9nez.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \"Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film, \"The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's \"Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\" (1925). \"The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, \"Wara Wara\" (1930) and \"Hacia la Gloria\" (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and \"Wara Wara\" remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is \"Amerindia\" (1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas. In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease. He and Hood moved to Houston for better medical care.

Son of Sidney Wortley Montagu and grandson of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich , Wortley Montagu was educated at Westminster School, Trinity College, Cambridge (1693) and trained in the law at the Middle Temple (1693). He was called to the bar in 1699 and entered the Inner Temple in 1706.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[3](Title: Speaker of the United States House of Representatives) Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Seal of the Speaker Flag of the Speaker Incumbent Paul Ryan since October 29, 2015 United States House of Representatives Style Mr. Speaker (Informal and within the House) The Honorable (Formal) Status Presiding officer Seat United States Capitol, Washington, D.C.

Following the acquittal of Angus Sinclair for the World's End Murders in 2007, on 20 November 2007 the then Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill MSP instructed the Scottish Law Commission to consider the law relating to several issues arising from the trial and make recommendations for reform. One of these issues was \"the principle of double jeopardy, and whether there should be exceptions to it\" In December 2009 the Scottish Law Commission published its report on the principle of double jeopardy. The commission recommended that the principle be retained in Scottish Law and also \"The general rule against double jeopardy should be reformed and restated in statute\". The commission further recommended that exceptions to the rule be created in three circumstances:\nThe commission addressed the issue of retrospectivity, recommending that any exceptions to the rule of double jeopardy only apply to cases heard after any legislation created to create the exceptions is passed. This recommendation was not followed by the Scottish Government and the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill introduced on 7 October 2010 included provisions to apply the proposed legislation retrospectively.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nDocument[2](Title: Phil Greco) Phil Greco( born October 1st, 1948) is a former head football coach and athletic director.\nDocument[3](Title: Nanban (2012 film)) Nanban is a 2012 Indian Tamil- language coming- of- age comedy drama film directed by Shankar.

During his research in the 1980s on the 44M Tas heavy tank he found sources mentioning that components for two chassis of the 44M Tas were made and he jumped to the conclusion that the second hull was for a tank destroyer based on the hull of the 44M Tas design. Due to the very limited information on the 44M Tas project at the time this spread as fact fairly quickly. It was first later in the 2000s that more information was found which explained that the components made where for a second 44M Tas prototype and not for some tank destroyer variant. P\u00e1l Korbuly in his research seems to have hinted that there was there was at least some idea based around making a tank destroyer on the 44M Tas chassis but no surviving documentation of this exists and if the idea actually existed it most likely stayed just as an idea and never went anywhere.\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Dominick Basso or Ilse Lehiste?": [

It was first presented at the 1999 SEMA Show. It is essentially a redesigned Prowler which addressed some of the complaints and problems existing Prowler owners had. The lack of cargo space in the Prowler was universally lamented, so the Howler addressed this by elongating and squaring off the back end, creating a moderate sized trunk. The Prowler was only available as a 3.5 L V6 that was rated at~ 250 hp at its highest. For what was considered to be a modern\" hot rod\", this was not considered to be enough power, so the Howler was given a 4.7L V8- which had nearly the same horsepower, but had significantly more torque. The engine is mated to a five speed manual transmission, instead of the Prowler's four speed automatic. This freed up some room in the undercarriage to enlarge the gas tank for the thirstier V8. The Howler also has a removable hardtop instead of the traditional ragtop of the Prowler. The top is manually removed, and can be stored in a compartment behind the seats. Though the concept was appreciated by most Prowler enthusiasts, the low sales volume of the Prowler and the ultimate demise of the Plymouth nameplate ensured that the Howler was never made into a production vehicle.\nDocument[6](Title: Autaz-mirim River) Autaz- mirim River is a river of Amazonas state in north- western Brazil.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Pixie Geldof's father?": [
