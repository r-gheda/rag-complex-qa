It deals with the life of Gay-Neck, a prized Indian pigeon. Mukerji wrote that \"the message implicit in the book is that man and winged animals are brothers.\" He stated that much of the book is based on his boyhood experiences with a flock of forty pigeons and their leader, as the boy in the book is Mukerji himself. He did have to draw from the experiences of others for some parts of the book, such as those who trained messenger pigeons in the war. The book offers an insight into the life of a boy of high caste during the early 1900s and also into the training of pigeons. Several chapters are told from Gay-Neck's perspective, with the pigeon speaking in first person. Elizabeth Seeger writes in a biographical note about Mukerji that, \"Gay-Neck was written in Brittany, where every afternoon he read to the children gathered about him on the beach the chapter he had written in the morning.\" In an article in the children\u2019s literature journal \"The Lion and the Unicorn\", Meena G.

During the Early Middle Ages, he united the majority of western and central Europe. He was the first recognised emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire. He was later canonized by Antipope Paschal III. Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon, born before their canonical marriage. He became king in 768 following his father's death, initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne the sole ruler of the Frankish Kingdom. He continued his father's policy towards the papacy and became its protector, removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain. He campaigned against the Saxons to his east, Christianizing them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden. He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Rome's Old St. Peter's Basilica. Charlemagne has been called the \"Father of EuropePater Europae\"), as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule. His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church. Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire considered themselves successors of Charlemagne, as did the French and German monarchs. The Eastern Orthodox Church viewed Charlemagne less favorably due to his support of the filioque and the Pope's having preferred him as Emperor over the Byzantine Empire's Irene of Athens. These and other disputes led to the eventual split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054. Charlemagne died in 814 and was laid to rest in his imperial capital city of Aachen. He married at least four times and had three legitimate sons who lived to adulthood, but only the youngest of them, Louis the Pious, survived to succeed him.\nDocument[2](Title: Michel Vaucaire) Michel Vaucaire( born 3 August 1904 in Brissago, Switzerland and died 18 June 1980 in Saint- Denis) was a French lyricist.

They are in particular the authors of\" Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien( No Regrets)\", written in 1956 with Charles Dumont, its most notable recording completed in 1960 by Edith Piaf. He was the husband of Genevieve Collin, better known under the name of Cora Vaucaire( see), \u201c the white lady of Saint- Germain- of- Meadows \u201d.\nDocument[3](Title: The Last Mitterrand) The Last Mitterrand (French title: Le Promeneur du Champ de Mars) is a 2005 film directed by Robert Gu\u00e9diguian depicting the final period in the life of an unnamed French President (but the English title suggests the president is Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand). The film is based on the book \"Le Dernier Mitterrand\" by Georges-Marc Benamou. Benamou had talked with and accompanied Mitterrand for the last 1,000 days of his presidency. Benamou worked for a small circulation magazine called \"Globe\" - a magazine for \"champagne socialistsla gauche caviar\" in the French idiom. It is not clear why Mitterrand chose Benamou but the journalist has said they got on well and discussed life, women and literature. When the resulting book appeared in 1997 however, Benamou was turned upon by many of Mitterrand's family and associates - even Pierre Berg\u00e9, who financed the \"Globe \" magazine called it a work of \"absolute treachery\" - and they would not help with the film. It seems they were particularly outraged not by revelations about Mitterrand's private life,-Mitterrand had a secret second family including the daughter he kept hidden from the public- or anything to do with Vichy, but with a description of Mitterrand devouring a plateful of ortolans. The bird is a protected species and eating them forbidden under EU law. Certain other people at the dinner called Benamou a liar saying this incident never happened. Benamou denied this. In 2004 one of Mitterrand's closest associates, who had also been at the meal said Benamou was right but no ortolans appear in the film and Mitterrand eats a plate of oysters. Benamou, an Algerian born Sephardic Jew, asserted that he had not found Mitterrand anti-semitic either in his time in Vichy or afterwards, - something that Mitterrand, who sometimes spoke of 'le lobby juif', his term for some French Jews' and their focus on his wartime record - had been accused of. Benamou defended Mitterrand in spite of his protection of collaborators like Ren\u00e9 Bousquet and Maurice Papon - \"Papon became a minister under Giscard d'Estaing; he was chief of police under de Gaulle. This is not a secret of Mitterrand [but of] the French bourgeoisie and Mitterrand was an emblem of that.\" The film won a C\u00e9sar award for Michel Bouquet in his role as Mitterrand.\n\nQuestion: Who is Charles Bretagne Marie De La Tr\u00e9moille's paternal grandfather?": [

He is considered one of the greatest film directors of all time. While in his twenties Welles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African American cast and the political musical \"The Cradle Will Rock\". In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941, including \"Caesar\" (1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\". In 1938, his radio anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" gave Welles the platform to find international fame as the director and narrator of a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel \"The War of the Worlds\", which caused widespread panic because many listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources say these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety. His first film was \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which is consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made, which he co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles released twelve other features, the most acclaimed of which include \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), \"The Lady from Shanghai\" (1947), \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) , \"The Trial\" (1962), \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1966) and \"F for Fake\" (1973). Welles was an outsider to the studio system, and struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios in Hollywood and later in life with a variety of independent financiers across Europe, where he spent most of his career. Many of his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. Some, like \"Touch of Evil\", have been painstakingly re-edited from his notes. With a development spanning almost 50 years, Welles's final film, \"The Other Side of the Wind\", was released in 2018. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots and long takes. He has been praised as \"the ultimate auteur\". Welles had three marriages, including one with Rita Hayworth, and three children. Known for his baritone voice, Welles performed extensively across theatre, radio and film. He was a lifelong magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years. In 2002 he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. He was also included in the list of the 50 greatest Hollywood actors of all time by The Telegraph UK.\nDocument[3](Title: Robert Stevenson (director)) Robert Edward Stevenson( 31 March 1905 \u2013 30 April 1986) was an English film writer and director.

He is best remembered for several horror films:\" Frankenstein\"( 1931),\" The Old Dark House\"( 1932),\" The Invisible Man\"( 1933) and\" Bride of Frankenstein\"( 1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical\" Show Boat\". He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, and many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. Whale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play\" Journey's End\" led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from\" Journey's End\"( 1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and\" Hell's Angels\"( 1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera. At the height of his career as a director Whale directed\" The Road Back\"( 1937), a sequel to\" All Quiet on the Western Front\". Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box- office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool. Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films,\" Bride of Frankenstein\" in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?": [

In January 1993, a live performance by Jackson at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration also served as a promotional platform, for both the song and AIDS- related funding. \" Gone Too Soon\" later received more exposure, following the deaths of both Diana, Princess of Wales, and Jackson himself.\nDocument[3](Title: Gillamaire Ua Conallta) Gillamaire Dall Ua Conallta, Irish poet and Chief Ollam of Ireland, died 1166.\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Madame Pasca or James A.

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \"computing machine\" and one of the first computer programmers. Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, \"Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart? \". He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace. Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\" and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\". When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called \"Notes\". These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool. She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, D'Arcy Coulson or Thomas William Adams?": [

In addition to being known for her film career, she received notoriety for being involved in several scandals throughout her career. Raised in Portland, Oregon, Carmen began acting in Hollywood at age 15, eventually performing with Keystone Studios. She first garnered public attention for her involvement in a statutory rape case involving herself and a 35-year-old automobile dealer in Los Angeles, but the charges against him were ultimately dropped as she could not concretely prove her age. Carmen resumed her career, appearing in several films throughout the 1910s, including a small role in D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), followed by leads in \"American Aristocracy\" (1916) opposite Douglas Fairbanks, and in Frank Lloyd's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1917). She also starred as Cosette in Lloyd's adaptation of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (also 1917). In 1918, she married film director Roland West. Carmen made her final film appearance in West's horror film \"The Bat\" (1926). In December 1935, Carmen garnered significant media coverage following the death of actress Thelma Todd, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the garage of Carmen and West's Pacific Palisades home. Carmen became embroiled in the investigation after she claimed to have seen Todd on Hollywood Boulevard hours after the time police determined Todd had died. A grand jury ultimately ruled Todd's death accidental, with the consensus that she had inadvertently caused her own death by running her car inside the garage to warm herself after West locked her out of the home; Todd and West had been engaged in a romantic affair at the time. Following Todd's death, Carmen and West divorced, and she lived the remainder of her life outside the public eye before dying in an El Cajon nursing home in 1984, aged 86.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born later, A Quiet Place In The Country or When Were You Born?": [

An active film-maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in the production of over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the \"Koker\" trilogy (1987\u20131994), \"Close-Up\" (1990) , \"The Wind Will Carry Us\" (1999), and \"Taste of Cherry\" (1997), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works, \"Certified Copy\" (2010) and \"Like Someone in Love\" (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films \"Where Is the Friend\u2019s Home?Close-Up\", and \"The Wind Will Carry Us\" were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics' poll by BBC Culture. \"Close-Up\" was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial \"Sight & Sound\" poll conducted in 2012. Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai, Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Masoud Kimiai, Dariush Mehrjui, Sohrab Shahid-Saless and Parviz Kimiavi. These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues. Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary-style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.\n\nQuestion: Where does the director of film Man At Bath work at?": [

It is a direct continuation of\" Paris By Night 22: 40 N\u0103m \u00c2m Nh\u1ea1c Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\" and\" Paris By Night 28: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 2- D\u00f2ng Nh\u1ea1c N\u1ed1i Ti\u1ebfp\", that was released several years earlier. This program was codenamed,\" In Houston 2\"( which was thought to be a successor to\" Paris By Night 36: In Houston\", before the title was announced). Before the main subject title was announced, the program was then codenamed to\" In Houston 2: Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng 3\"( the third Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series). The\" three\" was scrapped off the title and the subject was simply,\" Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\". Vietnamese composer, Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, is one of the Vietnamese community's most famous composers today; composing famous songs before and even after the Vietnam War, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Since the early years of\" Paris By Night\", Th\u00fay Nga has been making single- composer videos dedicated to just a single composer. Starting in Paris By Night 64: \u00d0\u00eam V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 Th\u00ednh Ph\u00f2ng however, Thuy Nga introduced the three- composer format.

However, composer Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is an exception. After being beloved by many, and his songs are in a timeless label, Th\u00fay Nga thought that he should deserve the entire program just dedicated to him and his songs, in a program that was meant for three composers. \" Paris By Night 88\" is Th\u00fay Nga's third live- performance show, after\" Paris By Night 86\" and\" Paris By Night 87\", which was the PBN Talent Show. This is a trend that Th\u00fay Nga may be beginning to adapt, after years of having singers lip- sync on stage, a practice that is common and accepted in the Vietnamese music community. \" Paris By Night 88\" used famous songs that was originally performed in\" Paris By Night 28\" and\" Paris By Night 22\", which were part of the Lam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng series. This is also director Alan Carter's first direction of\" Paris By Night\", in place of its regular director, Michael Watt after many years.

In 1803 he began publishing the \"Repertoire des Clavecinistes\", which included the first editions of keyboard pieces by composers such as Muzio Clementi, Johann Baptist Cramer, and Ludwig van Beethoven. He founded two singing societies (\"S\u00e4ngervereine\") in Zurich, in addition to writing profusely on music theory and aesthetics, as well as introductory treatises for students. He died in Zurich in 1836. Much of N\u00e4geli's compositional output consists of keyboard works and songs. His \"Gold'ne Abendsonne\" was adapted by others for various purposes. One version of the tune, sung by a bird (feathered) on \"Today\", was described by its presenters as a \"Folk Song\", but also appears in various music editions of the Metrical psalter (as the tune \"Zurich\"), where it is correctly attributed to N\u00e4geli.

(Antakaa Meille Luurankomme in Finnish, Oaivveskaldjut in North Sami) is a 1999 documentary film directed by Paul-Anders Simma about Niillas Somby, a Sami man who retraces his family ancestry as he searches for the head of his ancestor, Mons Somby. Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jakobsen H\u00e6tta were executed by decapitation on 14 October 1854 for murder, following the 1852 Kautokeino rebellion against the local Norwegian government in which two people were murdered. Their heads were claimed by the government for scientific research, and were held as part of a collection of 900 skulls at the Anatomical Institute, in Oslo. The movie describes three parallel plots; the first is Niillas Somby's story on how he became one of the most celebrated protesters during the Alta Dam Protests between 1979-1981 near Kautokeino, Norway. In the years that followed, he traveled in exile to Canada where he was given sanctuary by the Iroquois First Nation, and later returned to Norway. The second plot was the disturbing examination of the scientific racism and racial classification movement that was considered an accepted fact by Scandinavian scientists from the early 19th century until the 1950s. This included the plundering of Sami graves for their skeletons and the forced sterilization of the Sami and other peoples in Scandinavia who were viewed as competing with the \"noble races\", as part of a larger eugenics program. The third and final plot was Niillas Somby's emotional struggle with bringing Mons Somby's skull home for a proper burial.\nDocument[2](Title: Mastino II della Scala) Mastino II della Scala( 1308 \u2013 3 June 1351) was lord of Verona.

At the death of Cangrande I, he and his brother Alberto II were associated in the rule of Verona. Soon, however, Mastino's independent attitude overshadowed the brother's presence. In the first part of his reign, abandoning the careful policy of balance held by his father, he conquered Brescia( 1332), Parma( 1335) in Lombardy and Lucca( 1335) in Tuscany. However, the extension of Mastino's power spurred the creation of League of all the other local powers( Florence, Siena, Bologna, Perugia and Venice). In the first year of war he managed to resist, but in 1336 the League was joined by Azzone Visconti of Milan, the Este of Ferrara, the Gonzaga of Mantua and the Papal States. Surrounded by every side, he could only ask for a treaty of peace through the intermediation of Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria, which he obtained in 1339. His territories were restricted to Verona and Vicenza, the remaining part split among the victorious enemies. An attempt to recover part of his lands with the German mercenaries that had remained in Vicenza after the war, led by Lodrisio Visconti, was unsuccessful. He died in Verona in 1351. He is buried in the Gothic mausoleum near the church of Santa Maria Antica, in one of the Scaliger Tombs.\nDocument[3](Title: The Loves of Hercules) The Loves of Hercules is a 1960 international co-production film starring Jayne Mansfield and her then husband Mickey Hargitay.

His older brother was the famous \"Sun King\", Louis XIV. Styled Duke of Anjou from birth, Philippe became Duke of Orl\u00e9ans upon the death of his uncle Gaston in 1660. In 1661, Philippe also received the dukedoms of Valois and Chartres. Following Philippe's victory in battle in 1671, Louis XIV added the dukedom of Nemours, the marquisates of Coucy and Folembray, and the countships of Dourdan and Romorantin. During the reign of his brother he was known simply as \"Monsieur\", the traditional style at the court of France for the younger brother of the king. Although he was open about his homosexual behaviour and freely acted effeminately, he married twice and fathered several children. He was the founder of the House of Orl\u00e9ans, a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon, and thus the direct ancestor of Louis Philippe I, who ruled France from 1830 until 1848 in the July Monarchy. Through the children of his two marriages, Philippe became an ancestor of most modern-day Roman Catholic royalty, giving him the nickname of \"the grandfather of Europe\". He was also military commander at the Battle of Cassel in 1677. Through careful personal administration, Philippe greatly augmented the fortunes of the House of Orl\u00e9ans.\n\nQuestion: Who is Gaston, Duke Of Orl\u00e9ans's paternal grandmother?": [

Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia (1354\u20131360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41-year-old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief. Their only known child, a son named Philip, was born in 1371 and died the same year. Elizabeth was widowed on 25 November 1374.

Following her husband's signature for the Jaipur State to become part of the Union of India and her step-son's assumption of the title in 1970, she was known as Maharani Gayatri Devi, Rajmata of Jaipur. Ethnically born in a Koch Rajbongshi Hindu family, her father was Maharaja Jitendra Narayan of Cooch Behar in West Bengal, and her mother was Maratha Princess Indira Raje of Baroda, the only daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. Following India's independence and the abolition of the princely states, she became a successful politician in the Swatantra Party. Gayatri Devi was also celebrated for her classical beauty and became something of a fashion icon in her adulthood. She served 12 years in congress, during which time she was a prominent critic of Indira Gandhi's government. After her departure from politics, she lived a quiet life in her large estate, spending time with her grandchildren and on hobbies and leisure. She died on 29 July 2009 in Jaipur, at the age of 90. She was suffering from paralytic ileus and a lung infection. She left an estate estimated at nearly half a billion USD, which were passed on to her grandchildren.\nDocument[3](Title: Stephen III of Moldavia) Stephen III of Moldavia, known as Stephen the Great (died on 2 July 1504), was Voivode (or Prince) of Moldavia from 1457 to 1504. He was the son of and co-ruler with Bogdan II, who was murdered in 1451 in a conspiracy organized by his brother and Stephen's uncle Peter III Aaron who took the throne. Stephen fled to Hungary, and later to Wallachia, but with the support of Vlad III Dracula, Voivode of Wallachia, he returned to Moldavia, forcing Aaron to seek refuge in Poland in the summer of 1457. Teoctist I, Metropolitan of Moldavia, anointed Stephen prince. He attacked Poland and prevented Casimir IV Jagiellon, King of Poland, from supporting Peter Aaron, but eventually acknowledged Casimir's suzerainty in 1459. Stephen decided to recapture Chilia (now Kiliya in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which brought him into conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. He promised support to the leaders of the Three Nations of Transylvania against Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1467. Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the Battle of Baia. Peter Aaron attacked Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the Moldavian boyars who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and built new ones, which improved Moldavia's defence system as well as strengthened central administration. Ottoman expansion threatened Moldavian ports in the region of the Black Sea. In 1473, Stephen stopped paying tribute (\"hara\u00e7\") to the Ottoman sultan and launched a series of campaigns against Wallachia in order to replace its rulers \u2013 who had accepted Ottoman suzerainty \u2013 with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. However, each prince who seized the throne with Stephen's support was soon forced to pay homage to the sultan. Stephen eventually defeated a large Ottoman army in the Battle of Vaslui in 1475. Stephen was referred to as \"Athleta ChristiChampion of Christ\") by Pope Sixtus IV, even though Moldavia's hopes for military support went unfulfilled. The following year, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II routed Stephen in the Battle of Valea Alb\u0103, but the lack of provisions and the outbreak of a plague forced him to withdraw from Moldavia. Taking advantage of a truce with Matthias Corvinus, the Ottomans captured Chilia, their Crimean Tatar allies Cetatea Alb\u0103 (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine) in 1483. Although Corvinus granted two Transylvanian estates to Stephen, the Moldavian prince paid homage to Casimir, who promised to support him to regain Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103. Stephen's efforts to capture the two ports ended in failure. From 1486, he again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans. During the following years, dozens of stone churches and monasteries were built in Moldavia, which contributed to the development of a specific Moldavian architecture. Casimir IV's successor, John I Albert, wanted to grant Moldavia to his younger brother, Sigismund, but Stephen's diplomacy prevented him from invading Moldavia for years. John Albert attacked Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103, but had to acknowledge the loss of the two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler Bogdan III played an active role in government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in Moldovenism. After the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as \"Stephen the Great and Holy\u0218tefan cel Mare \u0219i Sf\u00e2nt\").\n\nQuestion: Where did Prince Gustav Of Thurn And Taxis (1848\u20131914)'s mother die?": [

Clayton looked set for a brilliant future, and he was highly regarded by peers and critics alike, but a number of overlapping factors hampered his career.

In 1977, he suffered a double blow - his current film was cancelled just two weeks before shooting was due to begin, and a few months later he suffered a serious stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak, and put his career on hold for five years.

It lies on the left bank of the Northern Dvina River, along the Kholmogory Highway, southeast of Arkhangelsk and north of the Antonievo- Siysky Monastery. The name is derived from the Finnish\" Kalmom\u00e4ki\" for\" corpse hillcemetery\"). Population: The Kholmogory area was at first in historical times inhabited by the Finno- Ugrians\" Savolotshij Thsuuds\",( sa-volokis, i.e.\" the Chud[ who live] beyond the portage\"), known also as Yems in old Novgorod chronicles, and Karelians. The first Slavonic population to enter to Kalmam\u00e4ki were Pomors from Vologda area after 1220. As early as the 14th century, the village( the name of which was then spelled\" Kolmogory\") was an important trading post of the Novgorod Republic in the Far North of Russia. Its commercial importance further increased in 1554 when the English Muscovy Company made it a center of its operations in furs. The Polish- Lithuanian vagabonds( see Lisowczycy) besieged the wooden fort during the Time of Troubles( 1613), but had to retreat in failure. In the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, the settlement was also a place of exile, notably for ex-regent Anna Leopoldovna and her children. In 1682, the six- pillared Kholmogory cathedral was consecrated; the biggest in the region. It was disfigured by the Communists in the 1930s. Many ancient wooden shrines and mills, however, still survive in the neighborhood. One of the nearby villages is the birthplace of the Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov. Local artisans\u2014such as Fedot Shubin\u2014have been famed for their craft of carving the tusks of mammoths and walruses. In Kholmogory, a craft of Kholmogory bone carving was developed in the 17th century. The bone carvings from Kholmogory were notable for excellent craftsmanship and perfected technique. The best carving masters from Kholmogory were invited to work in the Kremlin Armoury, which performed orders for the tsar \u2019s court.

He has been described as \"rock & roll's first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century.\" A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music , Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis. \" Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"Great Balls of FireBreathless\" and \"High School Confidential\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old cousin. He had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\" is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the \"Billboard Country and Western Chart\". His No. 1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for YouThere Must Be More to Love Than ThisWould You Take Another Chance on Me\", and \"Me and Bobby McGee\". Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper's \"Chantilly Lace\" and Mack Vickery's \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album \"Last Man Standing\" is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by \"Mean Old Man\" in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career. Lewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie \"Great Balls of Fire\", starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" listed his box set  number 242 on their list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records' Million Dollar Quartet and the \"Class of '55\" album, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley. Music critic Robert Christgau has said of Lewis: \"His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.\"\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song God (John Lennon Song) born?": [

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \" Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for\" his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/ native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry\" at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film,\" The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's\" Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\"( 1925). \" The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its\" social critique\" and\" because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films,\" Wara Wara\"( 1930) and\" Hacia la Gloria\"( 1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and\" Wara Wara\" remains\" the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent- film era\". He also made short documentary films,\" before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is\" Amerindia\"( 1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico.

The film was named for, and includes music from, the contemporaneous album \"Christopher's Movie Matin\u00e9e\" by influential Canadian folk music band 3's a Crowd. The film did not receive widespread theatrical distribution, instead being shown primarily in private screenings for schools and organizations until it was broadcast on CBC Television in 1969.

He was born in Rotterdam, the son of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. In 1607 he visited Paris with his brother Willem van Oldenbarnevelt as part of their Grand tour, and they were received at the court of king Henry IV of France. He married Anna Weytsen, lady of Brandwijk and Gijbeland, in Delft in 1608. They had three children; Jacoba Francina (1610), Johan (1612) and Jacob van Oldenbarnevelt (1614).

Van den Herik helped Feyenoord to purchase some players in 1984 as chairman of the\" Friends of Feyenoord Group\". In a few years time he had invested 3 million Dutch guldens in the club. In 1989 be became president of the Stadion Feyenoord NV. When Feyenoord almost was bankrupt due to their sponsor HCS, Van den Herik claimed his position in the Feyenoord board by saying\" If I lose my money, I would like to be there myself\". In 1992, he became Feyenoord's chairman by taking over from. In 1998 the Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service( FIOD) visited Feyenoord because of suspected fraud. Mainly based on the signings of Aurelio Vidmar, Christian Gyan and Patrick Allotey. This became a continuous subject in the years to come with Van den Herik as the main suspect. After several visits in court Van den Herik and Feyenoord were found to be not guilty in 2002. The Attorney General however appealed, but in 2005, after three years of investigations the results stayed the same. They still did not give up and went into cassation. On 19 December 2006 Van den Herik and Feyenoord came out of court as the winners again and this time it was the final decision. Van den Herik has already said he will take the Attorney General to court to reclaim the damage his personality has received in all these years. The 2005/06 season ended in disappointment for Feyenoord. The team was challenging the Dutch Championship for most of the season, but eventually lost it to PSV Eindhoven. The newly born Dutch play- offs( held for the first time that year) then became fatal for Feyenoord. Ajax Amsterdam which ended on a fair distance in the regular league was Feyenoord's opponent in the play- offs and overclassed them and Feyenoord was eliminated for winning an UEFA Champions League ticket. During the summer break Feyenoord had to sell two of their key players, Salomon Kalou and the very popular Dirk Kuyt. Only a small amount of the money became available to invest in new players. When Angelos Charisteas was signed from arch rivals Ajax to replace Dirk Kuyt hundreds of die- hard fans moved to the Feyenoord board to force Van den Herik to resign. Van den Herik stayed at the team and did not want to give up his position, unless the growing pressure, the underperforming of the team and several other problems that had not been solved yet. In the meanwhile Feyenoord was placed under special guardianship because of their financial problems. A group of some Feyenoord icons, with former chairman Gerard Kerkum as their leader, operated under the name of\" Commissie Kerkum\" to restructure Feyenoord's future. In December 2006 they published their thoughts and came to the conclusion that Van den Herik should leave the club. Still Van den Herik did not want to leave, however after hooligan incidents in Nancy and the growing pressure he announced his retirement in mid December. Van den Herik himself said not the thoughts of the Commissie Kerkum were the key factor for his decision, but the upcoming final result in the fraud case was. After the case was finished in December 2006- Van den Herik was acquitted- he stepped down. In the summer transfer window of 2007, Feyenoord surprised friend and foe with the signing of big names like Roy Makaay and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. According to player manager Rob Jansen, Van den Herik played an important role in the realization of the transfers.\n\nQuestion: Which country Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father is from?": [

Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi.

A Charles Hart was christened on 11 December 1625, in the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, in London. It is not absolutely certain that this was the actor, though the name was not common at the time .. He was most likely the son of William Hart, a minor actor with the King \u2019s Men. Hart began his career as a boy player with the King's Men; he was an apprentice of Richard Robinson, longtime member of that company. Hart established his reputation by playing the role of the Duchess in\" The Cardinal,\" the tragedy by James Shirley, in 1641. Wright says in Historia histrionica that:\" Hart and Clun, were bred up Boys at the Blackfriers; and Acted Womens Parts, Hart was[ Richard] Robinson's Boy or Apprentice: He Acted the Dutchess in the Tragedy of the Cardinal, which was the first Part that gave him Reputation.\" He served as a soldier in the English Civil War, and was an officer in Prince Rupert's regiment of cavalry, along with fellow actors Nicholas Burt and Robert Shatterell. Hart and the others most likely saw combat at the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and perhaps at Edgehill as well. Hart then returned to acting; evidence suggests he was with other displaced English actors in Europe in 1646. In 1648, Hart, Walter Clun and eight other actors, were involved in an attempt to restart the King's Men company during the Puritan Commonwealth, which, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. On 5 February 1648, at the Cockpit Theatre, Hart and other King's Men were arrested for violating the ban against theatrical performance; they were caught in the midst of a performance of\" Rollo Duke of Normandy\"( in which Hart played the character Otto). Hart and the others were imprisoned for a short time, then released. Just before the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, acting resumed on a larger scale, and Hart seems to have been then a member of a company performing at the Cockpit playhouse, led by Michael Mohun. As soon as the King's Company was formed in 1660, Hart became one of its leading men; he specialized in playing the male half of witty, bantering couples. This type of dialogue in Restoration comedy was largely influenced by the talents and personalities of Hart and Nell Gwyn, in plays like James Howard's\" The Mad Couple\"; Gwyn was his mistress before she became Charles II's. Hart's natural dignity in playing royal roles was also often commented on by contemporaries, and in the heroic play he\" was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden's\" Conquest of Granada When Hart played in\" Euterpe Restored\" in 1672, Richard Flecknoe composed the following lines: Throughout his Restoration career, Hart filled a range of noteworthy parts. He was Cassio in early stagings of Shakespear's\" Othello\"; after 1669 he played the title role. He played roles in revivals of plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and John Fletcher \u2014 \u2014 and in contemporary dramas, by John Dryden \u2014 \u2014 and by other dramatists \u2014 In 1682, when the King's Company joined with the Duke's Company to form the United Company, Hart retired due to poor health, with a pension of 40 shillings per week.\nDocument[3](Title: Patrick de Graham) Sir Patrick de Graham of Kincardine was a 13th- century Scottish noble.

He joined P.C.L.( a precursor to Toho) in 1933 and began working as an assistant director to Kajir\u014d Yamamoto alongside his longtime friend, acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa. He made his feature film directing debut in 1947 with\" Snow Trail,\" which was written by Kurosawa. \" Snow Trail\" starred Toshir\u014d Mifune in his film debut and actress Setsuko Wakayama. It helped establish Taniguchi's reputation for action film. Taniguchi and Wakayama married in 1949( he had earlier been married to the screenwriter Y\u014dko Mizuki), but the couple divorced in 1956. Taniguchi married his third wife, actress Kaoru Yachigusa, in 1957. Yachigusa and Taniguchi remained together for over fifty years until his death in 2007. Taniguchi was the screenwriter for the 1949 film,\" The Quiet Duel,\" which Kurosawa directed and which also starred Mifune. His most acclaimed film as a director was\" Escape at Dawn\", a controversial anti-war work from 1950 about a Japanese soldier and a\" comfort woman\" that got into trouble with Occupation era censors. Taniguchi continued to direct movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but the quality of his work declined.

First known as Lockhart School and established for the mill town's children, the school started in 1903 in a three- room frame building with Mrs. Christine McLeod as the first teacher and an enrollment of 75 students. The building was also used for Sunday school classes. That building was used until 1924 when a more modern school( the current grammar school building) was constructed of materials from Jackson Lumber Company and named W.S. Harlan Consolidated School in honor of the lumber mill's manager, William Stewart Harlan, who had secured its construction before his death in 1923. The junior high building was also built of Jackson Lumber Company materials and constructed in 1939 as part of the Federal Works Agency's Public Works Administration. The grammar school building is the oldest schoolhouse in Covington County, Alabama, still functioning as an active school. The school has served various grade levels through the years, from pre -K to eighth grade, but is currently an elementary school for students pre- K to sixth grade. The designations of the two buildings as\" grammar school\" and\" junior high school\" are in recognition of the days in which the school served students K- 8. No matter the age of the students, W.S. Harlan School has educated the children of the Lockhart area since it was part of the mill- town community of 1903. An Alabama Historical Association marker was unveiled at the school on December 11, 2017. On the same occasion the school \u2019s auditorium was designated the Joann Welch Geohagan Auditorium in honor of her 48 years of teaching at WSH.

He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Beas River. Alexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi: Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.\nDocument[3](Title: Elisabeth of Bohemia (1358\u20131373)) Elisabeth of Bohemia( 1358\u20131373) was the daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Anne of Schweidnitz.

Mendes de Leon was the son of Isaac Mendes de Leon( 1808 \u2013 1856) and Annely F. Phillips and grandson of Amsterdam city council member Jacobo Abraham Mendes de Leon( 1784- 1842) whose father, Abraham Jacob Mendes de Leon( 1764- 1818), was also an Amsterdam city council member. He grew up in his mothers country, England, until the age of ten, after which the family moved to Amsterdam. He studied medicines at the University of Amsterdam and in 1881 obtained a PhD at the University of Heidelberg. In 1882 he married his distant relative Anna Mathilde Teixeira de Mattos( 1862\u2013 1937). He promoted gynaecology in the Netherlands as a separate speciality, partly because of the new surgical possibilities following the discoveries of anaesthesia and antisepsis and in 1889 he started a private gynaecological clinic at the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam. In his clinic he devoted himself to the surgery of ovarian tumours, uterus myomatosus and genital prolapse, but also to the diagnosis and treatment of supposed inflammations of the cervix and endometrium as cause of psychological disorders. In this he followed the opinions of contemporary English gynaecologists. As he was not aware of physiological histology, he nearly always found signs of inflammation. He treated this with curettage and drastic caustics, sometimes after using a dilation knife( hysterotome) for the cervix. At the turn of the twentieth century Dutch gynaecologists such as Treub and Nijhoff began to cast doubt on such theories of\" reflex neurosis\", but Mendes de Leon persisted in his views.\nDocument[2](Title: George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence) George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (21 October 144918 February 1478), KG, was a son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the brother of English Kings Edward IV and Richard III.

One of the leading Belgian architects of the 20th century, De Koninck developed an original form of modernism and constructivism architecture. Not a theoretician, L H De Koninck has rooted his design in the in depth understanding of popular architecture developed by farmers on the Belgian sea shore. He spent many years copying these natural design, and maintained a deep sense of them all his life even when expressed through the most modern concepts and breakthrough use of lights and space in the 1920s. The growing corpus of publications on L.H. De Koninck, reflects the increased recognition of the importance of his work for Modern Architecture. \" History makers are often ignored for too long like the Californian architect Rudolf Schindler( 1887- 1953) whose career runs parallel to that of Louis -H De Koninck; it was only during the sixties that his work was examined for the first time then discovered and eventually revealed. It is no doubt owing to the detailed study, by the Archive of Modern Architecture in Brussels( since 1968) that De Koninck was mentioned in Michel Ragon's historical work and correctly situated in the Visual History of Twentieth- Century architecture in which Dennis Sharp compares the Lenglet Villa, built by De Koninck in 1926, with the houses which Gropius built in Dessau in 1925- 1926 and the famous House of Falling Water built about the same time in Bear Run by F.L. Wright( in order to illustrate the fundamental divergence which exist between a striking illustration of European doctrinaire functionalism- closed forms, square plan, endless surfaces of the white envelope- and the stimulated spatial character of American organic architecture based upon daring plan and articulations). \" De Koninck realized some of his most notable works prior to the founding of CIAM; namely his own house( 1924), Lenglet House( 1926) and Haverbeke house( 1927).

He was accompanied by his wife, Kwailan, and his five- year- old son Pierre. As the first known Trinidadian sailors to cross the Atlantic and later to circumnavigate, Harold and Kwailan were awarded the nation's highest honour \u2013 the Gold Trinity Cross. Harold was born in Trinidad, West Indies, on June 18th 1933( died June 2016), of parents with a rich mixture of blood in their veins \u2013 French, African, Spanish and Amerindian( Carib). He was educated at a local Roman Catholic school and began his sailing career by building dinghies, in which he taught himself the rudiments of seamanship, and reading any book about deep- sea sailing that he could lay his hands on. Harold La Borde was determined to get a suitable boat, opting to build one himself. In his first book,\" An Ocean to Ourselves\"( 1962), La Borde tells how he built a 26- foot ketch\" Humming Bird\". Harold and Kwailan, who were married in 1959, made their maiden voyage in the 26- foot vessel,\" Humming Bird\", to England in 1960, together with a friend, Buck Wong Chong. The\" Humming Bird\" was subsequently sold, and says Harold\" is somewhere in Europe.\" The La Bordes, always working as a team, took jobs at an Outward Bound school in Nigeria in 1961, after the voyage, but the call of the sea was too strong for the young couple and they returned to Trinidad in 1963, when they started to build the 40- foot ketch\" Humming Bird II\". Their first- born son, Pierre, arrived while work was in progress. The boat was completed in three years and, after chartering her out to Americans for a further three years in order to raise sufficient funds, the family set out on 2 February 1969 on the, now historic, voyage that took them around the world. Harold and Kwailan were both awarded their nation's highest award, the Trinity Cross for their seafaring adventure. Their second son, Andre, was born in Auckland, New Zealand, during the voyage. Upon their return home, the 40- foot\" Humming Bird II\" was purchased by the Trinidad and Tobago Government in 1973, and can be seen in the museum near the lighthouse on South Quay; and according to Harold\" is rotting away there. It is a sad thing, especially when you talk about taking care of historical things.\" The La Bordes went on to another circumnavigation voyage via Cape Horn( 1984 \u2013 86) in the\" Humming Bird III\". Harold La Borde T.C. also wrote a further two books with input from his family, wife Kwailan and sons Pierre and Andr\u00e9,\" All Oceans Blue\"( 1977), and\" Lonely Oceans South\"( 1987). Documentary films of their travels were made in conjunction with the Government Film Unit, which were also very professionally put together. After retiring from their respective jobs in Trinidad, the La Bordes ran a small family marina in Trinidad's busiest yachting bay. Harold's full- time job was working on the Humming Bird III, every day while Kwailan finished their autobiography which includes all of their sailing voyages to the present, entitled\" Wind, Sea, and Faith\".

The film stars Kapoor as the eponymous character, with Simi Garewal, Kseniya Ryabinkina and Padmini in supporting roles, and was also the debut of Kapoor's son Rishi Kapoor. The plot focuses on a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows. Three women who shaped his life view his final performance. The film is one of the lengthiest films of Indian cinema.

The film was partly made with the participation of Soviet actors and was partly shot in Moscow. The film's music, still very popular, was composed by Shankar Jaikishan, for which the duo got their ninth Filmfare award. In India, upon release the film was rejected by audiences and critics, putting Kapoor into a financial crisis, as the film was panned for its length and plot. The film has gained a cult status, and is regarded as a classic today. Both audience's and critics' response has turned highly favorable with the passage of time. An abridged version was released in the 1980s and had a highly successful run at the box office. Kapoor termed it his favorite film and described it as having deep philosophical depth and meaning.

Hallstein's sons were Philip and Ingi, and they succeeded to the Kingdom of Sweden after King Ingi the elder. (The 13th century \"Hervarar saga\") Other sources say that after the death of Philip (1118), Inge the Younger was the sole king of Sweden, but the year of his own death is unknown. According to the regnal list in the \"Westrogothic law\", Inge was poisoned with an evil drink in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland:\nNiun\u00f0i war Ingi konong\u00e6r, bro\u00f0her Philipus\u00e6r konongs, oc heter \u00e6ptir Ing\u00e6 kononge, Halstens konongs br\u00f8dh\u00e6r.

She often finds herself bearing the brunt of Ralph's insults, which she returns with biting sarcasm. She is levelheaded, in contrast to Ralph's pattern of inventing various schemes to enhance his wealth or his pride. In each case, she sees the current one's un-workability, but he becomes angry and ignores her advice (and by the end of the episode, her misgivings almost always are proven to have been well - founded). She has grown accustomed to his empty threats -- such as ``One of these days, POW!!! Right in the kisser! '',`` BANG, ZOOM!'' or ``You're going to the moon! ''-- to which she usually replies,`` Ahhh, shaddap!'' Alice studied to be a secretary before her marriage and works briefly in that capacity when Ralph is laid off.

Mullineaux correctly predicted that Mount St. Helens would erupt before the end of the 20th century. Born in Galesburg, Illinois, Crandell fought in World War II as a lieutenant in an Army mortar platoon. Once the war had finished he returned to America and earned a doctorate from Yale. It was then he was placed at the USGS office in Colorado. Crandell and Mullineaux, who met at the offices then began to work on the theory that Mount St. Helens will erupt. The pair proved that about 5,600 years earlier, the summit of Mount Rainier had collapsed and caused a landslide filling some valleys up to 400 feet deep. That awakened the recognition that a similar event could endanger hundreds of thousands of people living atop the ancient mudflows. They went on to write the 1978 report that claimed Mount St. Helens is \u201can especially dangerous volcano\u201d and it would more than likely erupt before the end of the 20th century. On May 18, 1980 their predictions came true when the volcano erupted killing 57 people and caused more than $1 billion worth of damage. He retired shortly after the eruption. Crandell died in a hospice in Colorado on April 6, 2009 after suffering a heart attack. He was survived by his two daughters, three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

He was landlord to Robespierre. On the evening of 17 July, after the Champ de Mars massacre, the authorities ordered numerous arrests. Robespierre, who attended the Jacobin club, did not dare to go back to the rue Saintonge where he lodged, and so asked Laurent Lecointre if he knew a patriot near the Tuileries who could put him up for the night.

It also includes some elements of anti-capitalist propaganda, claiming that the real rulers of Germany were \"armament kings\" such as Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.

His elder half-brother was the Elector Johann Cicero of Brandenburg. Friedrich succeeded his father as Margrave of Ansbach in 1486 and his younger brother Siegmund as Margrave of Bayreuth in 1495. After depleting the finances of the margraviate with his lavish lifestyle, Frederick I was deposed by his two elder sons, Casimir and George, in 1515. He was then locked up at Plassenburg Castle by his eldest son Casimir in a tower room from which he could not escape for 12 years. Thereupon, his son Casimir took up the rule of the Margraviate of Bayreuth (Kulmbach) and his son George took up the rule of the Margraviate of Ansbach. However, the overthrow of Frederick did outrage his other younger sons and led to far-reaching political countermeasures. When Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg visited Kulmbach during his journey to Augsburg, and wanted to plead for Frederick's release, he was nevertheless denied entry to Plassenburg Castle. The dispute was finally cleared when an agreement was reached in 1522, in which the demands of the younger sons of Frederick were met.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Guilty Of Treason?": [

Richard's father, Edward the Black Prince, died in 1376, leaving Richard as heir apparent to King Edward III. Upon the death of his grandfather Edward III, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne. During Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of regency councils, influenced by Richard's uncles John of Gaunt and Thomas of Woodstock. England then faced various problems, most notably the Hundred Years' War. A major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. A firm believer in the royal prerogative, Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private retinue for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre. The king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, Richard took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's \"tyranny\". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, Henry of Bolingbroke, who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, Bolingbroke deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate. Richard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by William Shakespeare, whose play \"Richard II\" portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, but that the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, leading to his downfall.\n\nQuestion: Where did Charles Stewart, 3Rd Duke Of Richmond's father graduate from?": [

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino, but which reduced papal finances. In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter's Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther's 95 Theses. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal Bull of 1520, \"Exsurge Domine\", condemned Martin Luther's condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult. He borrowed and spent money without circumspection. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, \"Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it. \" Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Leo also reorganised the Roman University, and promoted the study of literature, poetry and antiquities. He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy.\nDocument[2](Title: Jorge de Brito) Jorge Artur Rego de Brito (7 November 1927 \u2013 2 August 2006) was a Portuguese businessman, founder of Banco Intercontinental Portugu\u00eas (BIP) and Brisa, who served as the 28th president of sports club S.L. Benfica, succeeding Jo\u00e3o Santos. During Brito's term at Benfica, from 24 April 1992 to 7 January 1994, its football team won the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in 1993. At the end of that year, during the following season, he resigned due to financial difficulties dating back to \"Ver\u00e3o Quente\" (Hot Summer), when Benfica did not sign new players and lost two players to Lisbon rivals Sporting, thus not completing his triennal term. He was succeeded by Manuel Dam\u00e1sio. Associate number 88, Brito was awarded with the \u00c1guia de Ouro (Golden Eagle) by Benfica on 14 December 1973, during the presidency of Duarte Borges Coutinho.

He succeeded his father Boniface I, Margrave of Tuscany in Lucca \u2014 in what was an early example of hereditary succession \u2014 and extended his power over the region. During his tenure, the bishops of Lucca gradually lost control of the municipal government, which fell to the counts. Since 770, the counts of Lucca had been charged with the coastal defence of Tuscany and Corsica. In February 825, at Marengo, the Emperor Lothair I emanated a \"Capitula de expeditione corsicana\" for the defence of the island. In 828, Boniface received the titles of \"prefectus\" and \"tutela\" over the island from Lothair and the legateship of the island from the bishop of Luni. In July and August 828, he led a small fleet in search of Saracen pirates. Finding none at sea, the fleet landed at Sardinia and there decided to attack Africa. They assaulted the Saracen coast between Utica and Carthage with success. The fleet then returned to Corsica. In 833, Boniface backed Louis the Pious against his son Lothair, who promptly dispossessed him and put Aganus in his place. In 834, he joined with Ratald, Bishop of Verona, and Pepin, Count of Vermandois, to free the Empress Judith of Bavaria from her convent-prison. They escorted her back to Louis at Aachen. Boniface spent 836\u2013838 in Germany at court. Eventually he retired to hereditary lands in southern France. He was invited to participate in the trial of Bernard of Septimania, but died before he could. His son Adalbert regained the Tuscan march later.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Alessandro Vitelli's father?": [

Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the film stars David Niven, Roger Livesey, Raymond Massey, Kim Hunter and Marius Goring. The film was originally released in the United States under the title Stairway to Heaven, which derived from the film's most prominent special effect: a broad escalator linking Earth to the afterlife. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in Three- strip Technicolor, but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as\" Colour and Dye- Monochrome Processed in Technicolor\". This reversed the effect in\" The Wizard of Oz\". Photographic dissolves between\" Technicolor Dye- Monochrome\"( the Other World) and Three- Strip Technicolor( Earth) are used several times during the film.

Her family is of the House of Dinefwr. Nest was the wife of Gerald de Windsor (c. 1075 \u2013 1135), constable of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, by whom she was the ancestress of the FitzGerald dynasty and of the prominent Carew family, of Moulsford in Berkshire, Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire (in the Kingdom of Deheubarth) and of Mohuns Ottery in Devon (see Baron Carew, Earl of Totnes and Carew baronets). Nest had two younger brothers, Gruffydd ap Rhys and Hywel, and, possibly, an older sister named Marared, as well as several older illegitimate half-brothers and half-sisters. After their father's death in battle in 1093, \"the kingdom of the Britons fell\" and was overrun by Normans. Nest's younger brother Gruffydd was spirited into Ireland for safety; their brother Hywel may have been captured by Arnulf de Montgomery, along with their mother, unless, as appears likelier, their mother was captured with Nest; their fate is unknown.

He married Marared ferch Madog. His son, Llywelyn the Great, eventually united the realm and became known as\" Llywelyn Fawr\" and is one of Wales's most famous monarchs. Iorwerth received Nant Conwy as his inheritance from his father, Owain Gwynedd. However, he did not receive the crown succession, as was the normal tradition, because of his nose defect( his sobriquet' Trwyndwn' means broken- nosed).\nDocument[3](Title: Llywelyn the Great) Llywelyn the Great, full name Llywelyn ap Iorwerth,( c. 117311 April 1240) was a King of Gwynedd in north Wales and eventually ruler of all Wales. By a combination of war and diplomacy he dominated Wales for 45 years. During Llywelyn's childhood, Gwynedd was ruled by two of his uncles, who split the kingdom between them, following the death of Llywelyn's grandfather, Owain Gwynedd, in 1170. Llywelyn had a strong claim to be the legitimate ruler and began a campaign to win power at an early age. He was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200 and made a treaty with King John of England that year. Llywelyn's relations with John remained good for the next ten years. He married John's natural daughter Joan in 1205, and when John arrested Gwenwynwyn ap Owain of Powys in 1208, Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys. In 1210, relations deteriorated, and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover them the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216, he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year to apportion lands to the other princes. Following King John's death, Llywelyn concluded the Treaty of Worcester with his successor, Henry III, in 1218. During the next fifteen years, Llywelyn was frequently involved in fights with Marcher lords and sometimes with the king, but also made alliances with several major powers in the Marches. The Peace of Middle in 1234 marked the end of Llywelyn's military career, as the agreed truce of two years was extended year by year for the remainder of his reign. He maintained his position in Wales until his death in 1240 and was succeeded by his son Dafydd ap Llywelyn.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?": [

After earning her teaching credentials in Belgium and France, Rennotte taught for three years in Germany before moving to Brazil as a governess. Giving private lessons and teaching at a girls' school, she lived in Rio de Janeiro from 1878 to 1882. Hired to teach in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, she moved to Piracicaba where from 1882 to 1889 she taught science, developed the curriculum, and enhanced the reputation of the\" Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano\". The school was an innovative institution which promoted girls' education as equal to that of boys, offering co-educational instruction. In 1889, Rennotte, on a scholarship provided by the state, enrolled in medical school at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. That year, she was granted citizenship when a legal change allowed all foreigners permanently living in Brazil to become naturalized. Graduating in 1892, she studied at the Paris H\u00f4tel- Dieu Hospital between 1893 and 1895, completing a specialization in obstetrics and gynaecology. Upon her return to Brazil, she defended her thesis to a jury from the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Rio de Janeiro, validating her degree and allowing her to practice medicine in the country. From 1895 to 1899, Rennotte directed the obstetrics and maternity unit of the. She also saw patients both in the hospital and in private homes, assisting with births. Opening her own practice after she resigned from the Maternity Hospital, she operated a dispensary for the poor and immigrant communities, while continuing to see patients.

She conducted research at the surgery of the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia on the effects of chloroform as an anesthetic from 1906 to 1910 and then traveled to Europe to study how to establish a Red Cross Branch in S\u00e3o Paulo. Upon her return she founded the local branch in 1912, opened a nurses training school, and began a campaign to found the first children's hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo. She continued to practice medicine through the mid-1920s, but increasingly in the 1920s and 1930s became more involved in the international feminist movement and scientific conferences. In 1922, she founded the\" Alian\u00e7a Paulista pelo Sufr\u00e1gio Feminino\"( Paulistan Alliance for Women's Suffrage). By the late 1930s, suffering from ill health, blindness and deafness, she was granted a state pension, which she collected until her death in 1942.

Her husband was Emperor Wenxuan( Gao Yang), the first emperor of Northern Qi. Li Zu'e was the daughter of Li Xizong( \u674e\u5e0c\u5b97), and she was from Zhao Commandery( \u8d99\u90e1, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). She was ethnically Han. The date that she married Gao Yang, the second son of Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan, is not known, but it is known that at that time, he was the Duke of Taiyuan during the reign of his brother- in- law, Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei\u2014and she carried the title of Duchess of Taiyuan. She bore him two sons, Gao Yin, and Gao Shaode( \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7). In 549, Gao Yang took over the regency of Eastern Wei after his older brother, Gao Cheng, was assassinated by the servant Lan Jing( \u862d\u4eac). In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi( as Emperor Wenxuan). Emperor Wenxuan, before he became emperor, also had another key consort\u2014his concubine Lady Duan, the sister of his cousin and the powerful official Duan Shao( \u6bb5\u97f6). ( Duan Shao was born of Gao Yang's aunt, but it is not clear that Lady Duan shared the same mother, so it is not clear whether Lady Duan was his cousin.) The officials Gao Longzhi( \u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b) and Gao Dezheng( \u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), wanting to ingratiate themselves with Duan Shao, suggested that a Han woman should not be allowed to be empress. Emperor Wenxuan rejected their suggestion and created Li Zu'e empress, and only created Lady Duan an imperial consort. Emperor Wenxuan also created Empress Li's son Gao Yin crown prince. Emperor Wenxuan was violent and capricious in his behavior, fueled by his alcoholism, and often beat his consorts, although he never touched Li Zu'e. Once, when visiting Empress Li's household, he fired an arrow at Empress Li's mother, stating,' When I am drunk, I do not even recognize my own mother. Who do you think you are?\" However, despite Emperor Wenxuan's violent behavior \u2014 which included battering his concubines and sometimes even killing them \u2014he remained respectful of Empress Li herself. In 559, he also began to have her referred to as both\" Kehedun\"( \u53ef\u8cc0\u9813, the Tujue title for empresses) and empress. Emperor Wenxuan died in 559, and Gao Yin succeeded to the throne as Emperor Fei. Empress Li became empress dowager. However, the political climate of the time was uncertain, as there were suspicions that Emperor Wenxuan's mother, Grand Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun, would encourage her sons Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan or Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang to seize the throne. The prime minister Yang Yin, believing that the young Emperor Fei was being endangered, discussed a plan with Empress Dowager Li to gradually strip Gao Yan and Gao Zhan of power. Empress Li discussed the plan with one of Gao Cheng's widow consorts, Li Changyi( \u674e\u660c\u5100), who was her good friend coming from the same clan of Li. Li Changyi subsequently revealed the plan to Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who in turn relayed the news to Gao Yan and Gao Zhan. The two princes responded by arresting and executing Yang and his associates Kezhuhun Daoyuan( \u53ef\u6731\u6e3e\u9053\u5143), Song Qindao( \u5b8b\u6b3d\u9053), and Yan Zixian( \u71d5\u5b50\u737b). Gao Yan and Gao Zhan took over the reins of government, and Empress Dowager Li lost her remaining authority. Six months later, by Grand Empress Dowager Lou's decree, Emperor Fei was deposed, and Gao Yan became emperor( as Emperor Xiaozhao). Empress Dowager Li lost her empress dowager title, and became known as Empress Zhaoxin, because she resided at Zhaoxin Palace. In 561, Emperor Xiaozhao killed her son Gao Yin the former emperor. Emperor Xiaozhao died in 561, and Gao Zhan became emperor( as Emperor Wucheng). Some time after Emperor Wucheng's taking the throne, he began to force Empress Li to have a sexual relationship with him \u2014 threatening her that he would kill her son Gao Shaode if she did not agree. Eventually, she became pregnant, and in shame, she began to refuse seeing Gao Shaode. Gao Shaode found out that she was pregnant and became indignant. In shame, when she bore a daughter in 562, she threw the infant away, causing the child's death. When Emperor Wucheng found out, he became angry, and he stated,\" Because you killed my daughter, I will kill your son.\" He summoned Gao Shaode and, in her presence, beat him to death with the hilt of a sword. She cried bitterly, and Emperor Wucheng, in anger, stripped her and pounded her. She suffered severe injuries, but eventually recovered, and Emperor Wucheng expelled her from the palace to be a Buddhist nun. In 577, Northern Qi was destroyed by its rival, Northern Zhou. Empress Li followed the Emperor Wucheng's son Gao Wei, the penultimate emperor, to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an, where the members of Northern Qi's imperial Gao clan were slaughtered later that year. After Northern Zhou's own destruction in 581, Emperor Wen of Sui permitted her to leave Chang'an, and she returned to her home in Zhao Commandery. Nothing further is known about her, including the date of her death.\nDocument[2](Title: Empress Qiang) Empress Qiang (\u5f37\u7687\u540e, personal name unknown) (died 356), formally Empress Mingde (\u660e\u5fb7\u7687\u540e, literally \"the understanding and virtuous empress\"), was an empress of the Chinese/Di state Former Qin.

Little is known about her life during the next few years, when Murong Bao saw his empire collapse in light of attacks by Northern Wei and internal rebellions, and he was killed in a rebellion by Lan Han in 398, along with her son Murong Ce (\u6155\u5bb9\u7b56) the crown prince. Lan spared her, however, and after Murong Bao's son by his concubine Consort Ding, Murong Sheng, killed Lan and became emperor, he honored her as empress dowager.

After Zhang Jun's death in 346, Zhang Chonghua succeeded him and honored her as \"Empress Dowager\" while honoring Princess Yan as \"Grand Empress Dowager.\" After Zhang Chonghua died in 353, his son Zhang Yaoling carried the Jin Dynasty (265-420)-created title Duke of Xiping and was the titular ruler, but actual power was in Empress Dowager Ma's and Zhang Chonghua's older brother Zhang Zuo's hands. Most historians believed that she had an affair with Zhang Zuo, and later that year, she deposed Zhang Yaoling and replaced him with Zhang Zuo. In 355, however, the overly extravagant and cruel Zhang Zuo was deposed and killed by a coalition of officials, including Zhang Guan (\u5f35\u74d8) and Song Hun (\u5b8b\u6df7), and they pressured her into making Zhang Chonghua's younger son, Zhang Xuanjing, the new ruler. (Zhang Yaoling had been killed by Zhang Zuo earlier that year.) Zhang Guan initially served as regent, but was killed in 359 by Song Hun, who served as regent until his death in 361. He was replaced by his brother Song Cheng (\u5b8b\u6f84), who was in turn killed by Zhang Yong (\u5f35\u9095) later that year. It was said that Empress Dowager Ma also carried on an affair with Zhang Yong, who was in turn overthrown by Zhang Jun's youngest son Zhang Tianxi late in the year.

Brother was regarded as Winnipeg's first supergroup, playing all original material, the live shows of which were greatly admired by Burton Cummings. At the invitation of Cummings, Winter joined The Guess Who in June 1970, along with guitarist Greg Leskiw, who had also succeeded Winter as a guitarist in Gettysbyrg Address. He succeeded Randy Bachman, who had abruptly left The Guess Who. Winter is solely credited with writing the hit singles\" Bus Rider\" and\" Hand Me Down World\", both of which were hits for The Guess Who, but which had been composed while Winter was with Brother. Songs written by Brother were collectively written by Winter, Wallace and Masters. Winter also co-wrote a number of songs with group leader Burton Cummings, including the hits\" Hang on to Your LifeRain Dance\", and\" Runnin' Back to Saskatoon\" and also co-wrote\" Clap for the Wolfman\" with Cummings and Bill Wallace.

Kurt Winter was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on April 2, 1946. He attended Daniel McIntyre Collegiate Institute. Winter commenced the development of his music career with a number of Winnipeg bands, including Gettysbyrg Address( 1967, with later Guess Who bassist Bill Wallace), The Fifth( 1968, with drummer Vance Masters) and Brother( late 1969, with Wallace and Masters). Brother was regarded as Winnipeg's first supergroup, playing all original material, the live shows of which were greatly admired by Burton Cummings. At the invitation of Cummings, Winter joined The Guess Who in June 1970, along with guitarist Greg Leskiw, who had also succeeded Winter as a guitarist in Gettysbyrg Address. He succeeded Randy Bachman, who had abruptly left The Guess Who. Winter is solely credited with writing the hit singles\" Bus Rider\" and\" Hand Me Down World\", both of which were hits for The Guess Who, but which had been composed while Winter was with Brother. Songs written by Brother were collectively written by Winter, Wallace and Masters. Winter also co-wrote a number of songs with group leader Burton Cummings, including the hits\" Hang on to Your LifeRain Dance\", and\" Runnin' Back to Saskatoon\" and also co-wrote\" Clap for the Wolfman\" with Cummings and Bill Wallace. Winter was dismissed from The Guess Who in June 1974, with no reason specified, exactly four years after he had joined the band. He was replaced by ex-James Gang member Domenic Troiano. Winter later regrouped with a reformed lineup of the band under the leadership of bassist Jim Kale from 1977 to 1978, appearing on and contributing songs to the group's 1978 release,\" Guess Who's Back\". Winter remained a lifelong resident of Winnipeg.

Since 1998, a scholarship in Winter's name has been presented annually at Daniel McIntyre Collegiate Institute. Burton Cummings later memorialized Winter with\" Kurt's Song\" on Cummings' 2008 album,\" Above the Ground\". Cummings described Winter as\" one of my fondest writing partners\".

It was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Film in 1957. The lead character is said to be based on Sofia Kuvshinnikova who although married to another was until 1890 living with the painter Isaac Levitan in the town of Plyos where Sofia was improving her painting skills. Chekhov wrote \"The Grasshopper\" shortly after this time when the couple had returned. Chekhov was a close friend of Sofia's and may have had strong affections for her. The story was a way of criticizing her betrayal, both of him and her innocent husband, and created a small scandal.

It was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Cinematography and the other for Best Art Direction by Cedric Gibbons and John S. Detlie. The film is based on Coward's stage operetta, which was a hit in 1929 in London. It was filmed twice, first in 1933 in black- and- white( in Britain, with Anna Neagle and Fernand Gravet in the leading roles). The 1940 film is much cut and rewritten, removing much of the operetta's irony. The opening and closing scenes are cut, focusing the film squarely upon the relationship between MacDonald's character, Sarah, and her music teacher, Carl Linden. The opening scene was a flash forward, in which Sarah appears as an elderly woman recalling how she fell in love. One reason for dropping this scene is that it had been appropriated for MGM's 1937 film\" Maytime\". Coward disliked the 1940 film and vowed that no more of his shows would be filmed in Hollywood. In 1951, he told\" The Daily Express I was saving up\" Bitter Sweet\" as an investment for my old age.

His father, Louis I of Anjouthe founder of the House of Valois-Anjouwas a younger son of King John II of France and the adopted son of Queen Joanna I of Naples. When his father died during a military campaign in Naples in 1384, Louis II was still a child.

The Proven\u00e7al nobles and towns refused to acknowledge Louis II as their lawful ruler, but Marie of Blois persuaded them one after another to swear fealty to him between 1385 and 1387.

His troops could not occupy the whole kingdom, thus it was practically divided between Louis II and his opponent, Ladislaus of Naples.

He was the father of the legendary Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s Jr., who is commonly referred to as Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s. During the 1930s, as\" Ferenc Purczeld\", he played as a central defender with Kispest A.C.. Among his teammates at that club were Rezs\u0151 Rozgonyi and Rezs\u0151 Somlai, who both represented Hungary at the 1934 World Cup. In 1937 he changed his family name to\" Pusk\u00e1s\". After retiring as a player he became a coach at Kispest AC, where he was an early mentor to both his son, Ferenc Jr. and J\u00f3zsef Bozsik. He initially registered his son as a youth player using the pseudonym\" Kov\u00e1cs Mikl\u00f3s\" to help get around the minimum age rules. In the 1940s, Pusk\u00e1s became the senior coach at Kispest AC. During two spells at the club, he managed the senior team in over 200 games. After his first period ended in 1947, he was replaced by B\u00e9la Guttmann. However Guttman fell out with Ferenc Jr. and walked out, allowing Ferenc Sr. to return. During his second tenure, Hungary became a communist state, and Kispest were then taken over by the Hungarian Ministry of Defence and became the Hungarian Army team. The club was renamed\" Budapest Honv\u00e9d SE\" and Pusk\u00e1s guided the squad \u2013 which included Ferenc Jr. and Bozsik \u2013 to their first two Hungarian League titles.\nDocument[3](Title: Yekaterina Furtseva) Yekaterina Alexeyevna Furtseva (7 December 1910 \u2013 24 October 1974) was a Soviet politician and the second woman to be admitted as secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (the first being Yelena Stasova, member of the 7th Bureau). Furtseva was born in Vyshny Volochyok. Until the 1940s, she worked as an ordinary weaver at one of Moscow's textile factories. She had been a minor party worker in Kursk and the Crimea, and was called to Moscow and sent to the Institute of Chemical Technology from where she graduated in 1941 as a chemical engineer. Furtseva's party career started under Joseph Stalin. Gradually, she became active in Komsomol affairs and rose to the position of Secretary of the Moscow City Council in 1950. She gave a speech at the 19th Congress of the CPSU in 1952, the last party congress of the Stalin era, where she was also elected a candidate member of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Under Nikita Khrushchev, who sympathized with her, Furtseva was the first secretary of Moscow Committee of the CPSU from 1954 to 1957, a job Khrushchev himself occupied in 1930s. In 1952, Furtseva attacked the leading filmstar, Boris Babochkin, who was famous since starring as Vasily Chapayev. This time Furtseva saw the actor starring in a stageplay, and was enraged by Babochkin's satirical portrayal of the Soviet communist leadership. Her angry article in the Soviet newspaper Pravda called for censorship of Babochkin, while Furtseva furthered her career in the Soviet elite. Then Furtseva personally ordered that all film studios and drama companies of the USSR should refuse Babochkin any jobs, keeping him unemployed. In 1956 she was appointed a Secretary of the Central Committee and was elected a candidate member of Politburo. She became the first woman to join the Politburo the next year. In this capacity, she sided with Khrushchev in de-Stalinization during the Khrushchev's Thaw, and secured the downfall of Vyacheslav Molotov, Georgy Malenkov, and Lazar Kaganovich when they conspired to depose her patron. During that time she fell in love with Nikolay Firyubin, the Soviet ambassador in Yugoslavia. Furtseva scandalized the Soviet elite by her weekend trips abroad in order to meet her lover. As he married her and rose to become the Deputy Foreign Minister, they settled in Moscow, and their relations cooled down somewhat. During the following 14 years, she worked as the Soviet minister of culture. As she became highly influential, many remarkable actors and directors tried to secure her friendship in order to further their own careers. According to the most intimate of her friends (such as the singer Lyudmila Zykina), she also became addicted to alcohol. On 19 June 1974, \"Pravda\" revealed that she had failed to be re-elected to the Supreme Soviet. Two months previous she had been disciplined by the Party for extravagance and fined 40,000 rubles. She died in Moscow a few months later, officially of heart failure. Yet there were rumors that she was implicated in illegal commercial dealings and, wishing to preclude the impending scandal and disgrace, committed suicide. Furtseva is buried at the Novodevichye Cemetery.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Csaba P\u00e1link\u00e1s or Henry Scheff\u00e9?": [

The film is based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw( Craig), a wealthy cattleman( Ford), and a mysterious traveler( Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based on a screen story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers. The project began development in April 1997, when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures bought film rights to a concept pitched by Rosenberg, former president at Malibu Comics, which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of$ 163 million, filming for\" Cowboys& Aliens\" began in June 2010, in New Mexico and California. Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3- D, Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format( widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film) to further a\" classic movie feel\". Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's\" inherently comic\" title and premise. The film's aliens were designed to be\" cool and captivating\", with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic- Con and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on, 2011. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking$ 174.8 million in box office receipts on a$ 163 million budget. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released more recently, Pirates Of The Prairie or Alien Origin?": [

She was raised at the court of their father, but her younger sister Dulce and her brother Ferdinand were raised with their mother in Portugal after the annulment of their parents' marriage in 1195. Although in Castile it was customary for females to inherit, and Sancha's stepmother became queen, briefly, of Castile, in Le\u00f3n female succession was barred, although her ancestor Urraca had been the first queen regnant of Western Europe. After the death of Sancha's brother (1214), Alfonso IX named his second son, also Ferdinand, his heir, bestowing on him the title \"infante\" (1216). In 1217, with the support of the aristocracy, Alfonso granted his daughters Sancha and Dulce the villages of Portela de San Juan, Burgo de Ribadavia and Allariz, to be ruled by them until their deaths, after which they would revert to the Crown. In that same year, Ferdinand's mother, Berengaria, inherited the Kingdom of Castile, but ceded it to her son, who was proclaimed king at Valladolid on 2 July. With his heir out of the kingdom and ruling in another place, Alfonso attempted to make his eldest daughters his joint heirs. In the Treaty of Boronal concluded with Portugal in 1219, Alfonso expressly states that if he should die, Portugal should respect the agreement with his daughters. Alfonso also attempted to secure his eldest daughter's rights by marrying her to John of Brienne, the former King of Jerusalem, but his wife Berengaria blocked this action in order to advance her son. In the spring of 1224, John was on the Way of Saint James, passing through Alfonso's kingdom, when he decided to stop in Toledo in order to see his prospective bride. There the queen convinced him instead to marry her daughter, Berengaria, and on his return trip, at Burgos, he did, his wife and he being accompanied as far as Logro\u00f1o by the king and former queen of Castile. After this fiasco, Alfonso declared Sancha and Dulce his heirs, but upon his death on 24 September 1230, the people of Le\u00f3n, who had pledged for Ferdinand in 1206, refused to recognise his daughters, and they in turn ceded their rights to his kingdom to their half-brother. She was 38 years old at the time. This agreement, negotiated at Valencia de Don Juan by Berengaria and Theresa, with Sancha and Dulce present, is known as the \"pact of the mothers\". The treaty was signed Benavente and in compensation Ferdinand promised a yearly stipend of 30,000 \"maraved\u00edes\" to each of his half-sisters and the lordship of certain castles.\n\nQuestion: Who is Sancho Ram\u00edrez's maternal grandfather?": [

Filmed in 3- D and DeLuxe Color and presented in CinemaScope, it is notable as the only U.S. feature film made in 3- D between\" Revenge of the Creature\", which was released in the spring of 1955 and marked the end of the 1950s 3- D movie fad in the U.S., and\" The Bubble\", which premiered in late 1966 and introduced the economical\" over- and- under\" single- strip format used by most of the 3- D films of the 1970s and 1980s. Like the feature- length 3- D films of the 1950s when they were originally released, it was projected by the polarized light method and viewed through gray Polaroid filters in viewers which, according to the film's poster, were\" scientifically designed by master craftsmen!\" Most theaters, however, presented it\" flat\", in 2- D. Although it is widely believed to have been filmed in Stereovision, Bob Furmanek, who oversaw the 2016 restoration, says this is a myth. It was shot full- frame with the original NaturalVision cameras used on\" Bwana Devil\". The center of the image was then extracted to create a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, in the manner of the then- current Superscope process. Unfortunately, it was poorly done, resulting in a large number of badly- framed shots; for example, the scene with the Flamenco dancers has a huge amount of headroom while their feet are cut off. Both\" September Storm\" and 3- D in general were roundly dismissed by influential critic Bosley Crowther in his\" New York Times\" review.\nDocument[3](Title: A Yank at Eton) A Yank at Eton is an American comedy-drama film directed by Norman Taurog and starring Mickey Rooney, Ian Hunter, and Peter Lawford. Released in 1942, it is a kind of junior version of the 1938 British-made hit film \"A Yank at Oxford\". (Edmund Gwenn, who played a school official in the earlier film, has a similar role in this one.) With the United Kingdom at war, \"A Yank at Eton\" was filmed entirely in the United States. \"A Yank at Eton\" tells the tale of a cocky American youth (played by Rooney) who has to move to Britain, where he is sent to attend the elite Eton College. Lawford, in his first significant Hollywood role, plays an arrogant upperclassman who makes the newcomer's life particularly difficult. Much of the storyline relates to the misunderstandings arising from differences between the two countries' cultures, customs and language. At first these differences cause the boy confusion and anger, particularly against the traditional practices of fagging and physical hazing inflicted at Eton on the lower boys by the uppers. The film caricatures Etonian manners and behavior as snobbish and stuffy, but in due course Rooney's character settles down, stops being rebellious and comes to realize that, beneath the different habits and views, \"Yanks\" and \"Limeys\" have basic values in common and can get along when they have to. The propaganda intent, as U.S. troops poured into the U.K. to join World War II in 1942, was evidently to show that Americans and Britons could set aside their superficial differences and pull together in the war effort. The film has the Eton boating song as its theme tune (played at a faster tempo than usual), though no boating is shown in the film.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born earlier, Spring Storms or Fun In The Barracks?": [

V. Sridhar. The film stars Gemini Ganesan and B. Saroja Devi in the lead roles while K. A. Thangavelu, C. R. Vijayakumari, M. Saroja, S. D. Subbulakshmi, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and M. N. Nambiar play supporting roles. A triangular love story, the film is about two close sisters whose lives turn upside down when they both fall in love with the same man. Out of respect, the younger sister decides to sacrifice her love, unknown to the elder sister. \"Kalyana Parisu\" was the directorial debut of Sridhar, who co-produced it with his partners S. Krishnamurthi and T. Govindarajan under Venus Pictures. It also marked the cinematic debut of Chitralaya Gopu, who worked as associate writer, and the debut of A. M. Rajah as a music composer in Tamil. Cinematography was handled by A. Vincent, and editing by N. M. Shankar.\n\"Kalyana Parisu\" was released on 9 April 1959. It was critically acclaimed, particularly for eschewing formulaic Tamil cinema conventions like long dialogues and fixed-point cinematography in favour of short verses with simple words and camera mobility. The film was commercially successful, running for over 25 weeks in theatres and thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. At the 7th National Film Awards, it won the Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Tamil . \"Kalyana Parisu\" emerged a milestone in Tamil cinema, and the breakthrough for Saroja Devi and Rajah. Its success led to Sridhar launching his own production company Chitralaya Pictures, and set the pattern for his later works in which he repeated the motif of the eternal triangle and unrequited love. The comedy subplot written by Gopu involving Thangavelu and M. Saroja gained popularity, and was sold separately on audio cassettes and vinyl records. The film was later remade by Sridhar in Telugu as \"Pelli Kanuka\" (1960) and Hindi as \"Nazrana\" (1961), and in Malayalam by J. Sasikumar as \"Sammanam\" (1975).\nDocument[2](Title: Sindhu Bhairavi (film)) Sindhu Bhairavi is a 1985 Indian Tamil- language musical drama film directed and produced by K.

This was only the third film directed by Dreyer, who later went on to create such classics as \"Vampyr\" (1931) and \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928). The film is structured much like D.W. Griffith's Intolerance\" (film)\" (1916) with its episodic nature while evoking F. W. Murnau's Satan\" (1920 film)\" (1920). The film ran 157 minutes, but sources list the DVD's running time at 121 minutes. Troy Howarth states \"If not for the presence of Satan, (this film) wouldn't warrant inclusion in a study of the horror genre; in truth it's more of a quaint pageant play than a horror film... The cast emotes to a degree too theatrical for even silent cinema.\"\nDocument[2](Title: Ed and Lorraine Warren) Edward Warren Miney (September 7, 1926 \u2013 August 23, 2006) and Lorraine Rita Warren (n\u00e9e Moran; January 31, 1927 \u2013 April 18, 2019) were American paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent cases of hauntings. Edward was a self-taught and self-professed demonologist, author, and lecturer. Lorraine professed to be clairvoyant and a light trance medium who worked closely with her husband. In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research, the oldest ghost hunting group in New England. They authored numerous books about the paranormal and about their private investigations into various reports of paranormal activity. They claimed to have investigated over 10,000 cases during their career. The Warrens were among the very first investigators in the controversial Amityville haunting. According to the Warrens, the N.E.S.P.R. uses a variety of individuals, including medical doctors, researchers, police officers, nurses, college students, and members of the clergy in its investigations. Stories of ghost hauntings popularized by the Warrens have been adapted as or have indirectly inspired dozens of films, television series and documentaries, including 17 films in the \"Amityville Horror\" series and seven films in The Conjuring Universe. Skeptics Perry DeAngelis and Steven Novella have investigated the Warrens' evidence and described it as \"blarney\". Skeptical investigators Joe Nickell and Benjamin Radford concluded that the more famous hauntings, Amityville and the Snedeker family haunting, did not happen and had been invented.\nDocument[3](Title: Cowboys & Aliens) Cowboys& Aliens is a 2011 American science fiction Western film directed by Jon Favreau and starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. The film is based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw( Craig), a wealthy cattleman( Ford), and a mysterious traveler( Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based on a screen story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers. The project began development in April 1997, when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures bought film rights to a concept pitched by Rosenberg, former president at Malibu Comics, which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of$ 163 million, filming for\" Cowboys& Aliens\" began in June 2010, in New Mexico and California. Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3- D, Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format( widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film) to further a\" classic movie feel\". Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's\" inherently comic\" title and premise. The film's aliens were designed to be\" cool and captivating\", with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic- Con and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on, 2011. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking$ 174.8 million in box office receipts on a$ 163 million budget. \" Cowboys& Aliens\" received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the creator of Conan The Adventurer (1992 Tv Series)?": [

The film, based on a script by Nunnally Johnson, tells the story of a contractor and his wife, and how their musical ambitions result in marital tensions and a romantic triangle with a professional singer. The film was remade as \"Everybody Does It\" (1949), starring Paul Douglas as the contractor, Celeste Holm as his wife, and Linda Darnell as the singer.\nDocument[2](Title: It's All Too Much) \"It's All Too Much\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1969 album \"Yellow Submarine\". Written by George Harrison in 1967, it reflects the ideological themes of that year's Summer of Love. The Beatles recorded the track in May 1967, shortly after completing their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". It was one of four new songs they then supplied for the 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", to meet their contractual obligations to United Artists. Harrison wrote \"It's All Too Much\" as a celebration of his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD, although he subsequently found the same realisations in Transcendental Meditation and denounced LSD after visiting Haight-Ashbury in August 1967. The song features a Hammond organ, which gives the track a drone-like quality typical of Indian music, electric guitar feedback, and an overdubbed brass section. Largely self-produced by the band, the recording displays an informal approach that contrasts with the discipline of the Beatles' previous work, particularly \"Sgt. Pepper\". The song's sequence in the \"Yellow Submarine\" film has been recognised for its adventurousness in conveying a hallucinogenic experience. Although several Beatles biographers dismiss the track as aimless, \"It's All Too Much\" has received praise from many other commentators. Peter Doggett considers it \"one of the pinnacles of British acid-rock\", while Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" rates it among \"the top five all-time psychedelic freakouts in rock history\". Former Gong guitarist Steve Hillage adopted the song during his early years as a solo artist in the late 1970s. Journey, the House of Love, the Grateful Dead and the Church are among the other artists who have recorded or performed the track.\nDocument[3](Title: I'll Never Forget You (film)) The House in the Square, also titled I'll Never Forget You (US) and Man of Two Worlds, is a 1951 fantasy film about an American atomic scientist who is transported to the 18th century, where he falls in love. It starred Tyrone Power and Ann Blyth and was an early film for director Roy Ward Baker. It was adapted from the play \"Berkeley Square\" by John L. Balderston, which was also the basis of the 1933 film \"Berkeley Square\". Irene Browne reprised her role as Lady Anne Pettigrew from the 1933 version.

The project also featured guest participations of singers Zaine Griff and Linda Jardim. (now: Allan) During 1979 and 1980, Zimmer and Cann were constantly working along as part of the backing band of New Zealand singer Zaine Griff, and were also doing TV presentations as part of the guest line-up of musicians with The Buggles. With Griff, the duo were touring in 1979, played with Griff at Reading '79 Festival and played for his debut album \"Ashes and Diamonds\", released in 1980. In the summer of 1980, Zimmer and Cann established a 'changing project' (not a band) while discussing the possibility of writing and recording an 'adventure' album. The following autumn of 1981 they began work on the project, recording initial material. In March 1983, the forthcoming album was announced as to be called \"Spies\". It consisted of 12 songs, all recorded with synthesizers and computers. Some songs were purely instrumental (Mother Company, Pyramids Of The Reich, Moonlight In Vermont and Eva). The other songs had vocals by (mostly) Zaine Griff and Linda Jardim (Allan), but also Hugo Vereker and French singer Ronny. Some songs are similar to Zaine Griff's songs on the album Figvres (on which Hans Zimmer also contributed instrumental arrangements, keyboards and computers): Stranded, Borderline and Holding On. Other songs were reminiscent of the worldwide hit song \"Video Killed The Radio Star\" by The Buggles - to which Zimmer also contributed: Young & Scientific, 2529 and Movies for Eva, while some songs sound more theatrical and dramatic: The Ball and My Killing Hand. The album was meant to be released in 1983, but that was cancelled. Fans urged the band to release the album and when that did not happen it was later unofficially released as a bootleg. Some parts of their repertoire and BBC Radio One interviews were compiled into an unofficial compilation album called \"Radio One Saturday Live\". A single, \"Holding On\" (a vocal duet between Zaine Griff and Linda Jardim) was officially released on their own label ZiCa Records in autumn 1983, followed by \"Stranded\" in 1985, which came free with issue 19 of In The City magazine. Helden material featured Zaine Griff, Linda Jardim (now Allan), Eddie Maelov (of Gloria Mundi and Eddie And Sunshine), Ronny, Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, among others. After Cann and Zimmer ended the project, both went to collaborate with Spanish new wave band Mecano in their 1984-85 tour. Part of the tour was featured on the unofficial live album , released in 1985. Ultravox's official fan page announced the \"Spies\" album would be released on CD for the first time with bonus material. The exact date was not mentioned, but it had been said to be in plans since 1993. As of now, the album remains officially unavailable.\nDocument[2](Title: Flintes\u00f8nnerne) Flintes\u00f8nnerne is a 1956 Danish family film directed by Alice O'Fredericks.\nDocument[3](Title: Venus fra Vest\u00f8) Venus fra Vest\u00f8( literally,\" Venus from West Island\") is a 1962 Danish comedy war film directed by Annelise Reenberg and starring Malene Schwartz.

The film generally traces the history of jazz music from the popularization of Ragtime in the early years of the 20th century to the acceptance of swing as an art form in the late 1930s using music composed by Berlin. The story spans more than two decades from the 1911 release of its name- sake song to some point in time after the 1933 release of\" Heat Wave\", presumably 1938. It stars Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley and Jean Hersholt. Several actual events in the history of jazz are fictionalized and adapted to the story including the tour of Europe by Original Dixieland Jass Band, the global spread of jazz by U.S. soldiers during World War I, and the 1938 Carnegie Hall performance by The Benny Goodman Orchestra. There are no mentions of the primary importance of blacks in creating and playing jazz anywhere in the film. The story was written by Berlin himself, with Kathryn Scola, Richard Sherman( 1905 \u2013 1962) and Lamar Trotti. It was directed by Henry King It is believed by some that both the song and the movie were inspired by a real bandleader, Alexander Constantin Jr. of New Orleans( also known as\" King\" Watzke), and his band, Alexander's Ragtime Band, which was popular c. 1904- 11.\nDocument[2](Title: Miracle on 34th Street) Miracle on 34th Street (initially released as The Big Heart in the United Kingdom) is a 1947 American Christmas comedy-drama film written and directed by George Seaton and based on a story by Valentine Davies.

The film was nominated for Best Picture, losing to \"Gentleman's Agreement\".

Alexander Boswell was the eldest son of James Boswell( ca. 1672\u2013 1749), 7th Laird of Auchinleck. He attended the University of Edinburgh, read Civil Law at the University of Leyden and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1727. He was appointed Sheriff of Wigtown in 1748 but resigned the position in 1750 after inheriting the Auchinleck estate in Ayrshire on the death of his father. There he built the present Adam- style Auchinleck House. Alexander was nominated to the Court of Session in 1754, receiving the additional appointment to the High Court of Justiciary in the following year. As a judge he took the courtesy title\" Lord Auchinleck\" from the name of his estate, of which he was the 8th Laird. He is noted for rescuing of the Auchinleck manuscript in 1740 from a professor of the University of Aberdeen who was in the process of destroying it. He donated the manuscript to the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh.

A great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria , she was born in Windsor Castle and grew up in the United Kingdom, the German Empire, and the Mediterranean. A Hessian princess by birth, she was a member of the Battenberg family, a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was congenitally deaf. After marrying Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903, she adopted the style of her husband, becoming Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark. She lived in Greece until the exile of most of the Greek royal family in 1917. On returning to Greece a few years later, her husband was blamed in part for the country's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922), and the family was once again forced into exile until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935. In 1930, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was committed to a sanatorium in Switzerland; thereafter, she lived separately from her husband. After her recovery, she devoted most of her remaining years to charity work in Greece. She stayed in Athens during the Second World War, sheltering Jewish refugees, for which she is recognised as \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by Israel's Holocaust memorial institution, Yad Vashem. After the war, she stayed in Greece and founded a Greek Orthodox nursing order of nuns known as the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary. After the fall of King Constantine II of Greece and the imposition of military rule in Greece in 1967, she was invited by her son and daughter-in-law to live at Buckingham Palace in London, where she died two years later.

He also had several younger sisters. Montacute was summoned to parliament in 1357.

James was an unpopular and ineffective monarch owing to an unwillingness to administer justice fairly, a policy of pursuing alliance with the Kingdom of England, and a disastrous relationship with nearly all his extended family. However, it was through his marriage to Margaret of Denmark that the Orkney and Shetland islands became Scottish. His reputation as the first Renaissance monarch in Scotland has sometimes been exaggerated, based on attacks on him in later chronicles for being more interested in such unmanly pursuits as music than hunting, riding and leading his kingdom into war. In fact, the artistic legacy of his reign is slight, especially when compared to that of his successors, James IV and James V. Such evidence as there is consists of portrait coins produced during his reign that display the king in three-quarter profile wearing an imperial crown , the Trinity Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes, which was probably not commissioned by the king, and an unusual hexagonal chapel at Restalrig near Edinburgh, perhaps inspired by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nDocument[3](Title: William I of Geneva) William I of Geneva ( \u2013 25 July 1195) was Count of Geneva from 1178 to 1195, in succession to his father, Count Amadeus I of Geneva.

A centenarian, he is one of the last surviving stars of the film industry's Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he made his film debut in \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\" (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck and Lizabeth Scott. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career, he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas is known for his explosive acting style, which he displayed as a criminal defense attorney in \"Town Without Pity\" (1961). Douglas became an international star through positive reception for his leading role as an unscrupulous boxing hero in \"Champion\" (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Other early films include \"Young Man with a Horn\" (1950), playing opposite Lauren Bacall and Doris Day, \"Ace in the Hole\" opposite Jan Sterling (1951), and \"Detective Story\" (1951), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Drama. He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" (1952), opposite Lana Turner, and his third nomination for portraying Vincent van Gogh in \"Lust for Life\" (1956), which landed him a second Golden Globe nomination. In 1955, he established Bryna Productions, which began producing films as varied as \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) and \"Spartacus\" (1960). In those two films he collaborated with the then-relatively-unknown director Stanley Kubrick, taking lead roles in both films. Douglas has been praised for helping to break the Hollywood blacklist by having Dalton Trumbo write \"Spartacus\" with an official on-screen credit. He produced and starred in \" Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962), considered a classic, and \"Seven Days in May\" (1964), opposite Burt Lancaster, with whom he made seven films.

Described as \"A truly masterful film essay about Black aesthetics that traces the deployments of science fiction within pan-African culture\", it has also been called \"one of the most influential video-essays of the 1990s, influencing filmmakers and inspiring conferences, novels and exhibitions\". The fictional story follows the journey of the \"data thief\" who must travel across time and space in search of a crossroads where he makes archaeological digs for fragments of history and technology in search of the code that holds the key to his future. The structure of the film makes it a meta-narrative commenting on while also becoming part of the genre of Afrofuturism. The film uses concepts based on George Clinton's Mothership Connection and features interviews with Clinton, Derrick May, Samuel R. Delany, Nichelle Nichols, Juan Atkins, DJ Spooky, Goldie, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Kodwo Eshun and others to explore the link between black music as a way of exploring the future. The film makes mention of Sun Ra, whose work centres on the return of blacks to outer space in his own Mothership. \"The Last Angel of History\" emphasizes black musical traditions. The film argues that the drum, which could \"communicate both across the African diaspora and across time,\" was the \"first Afrofuturistic technology. \" In \"Further Considerations on Afrofuturism,\" Eshun says of the film: The Last Angel of History\" remains the most elaborate exposition on the convergence of ideas that is Afrofuturism. Through the persona of a time-traveling nomadic figure known as the Data Thief, \"The Last Angel of History\" created a network of links between music, space, futurology, and diaspora. \" The film forges links between, for example, spirituals, P-Funk, and techno.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born first, Ghost-Town Gold or The Musician Killer?": [

Wang was married to Jingtai in 1449. When the elder brother of Jingtai was taken prisoner by the Mongols later that year, Jingtai became emperor, and Wang was given the position of empress by his side. Empress Wang had two daughters with the emperor, but no son. In May 1452, Jingtai declared the son of his secondary Consort Hang heir to the throne. At the same time, he promoted Hang to the position of empress, being the mother of the crown prince, and demoted Wang and stripped her of the title. After her demotion, the ex-empress Wang lived a quite life outside of the palace walls. She survived the deposition and death of Jingtai in 1457, when the rest of his concubines and spouses were ordered to commit suicide. The reason for this was possibly because she had assisted the nephew of her spouse, the future Chenghua Emperor, to hide from Jingtai.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Consort Liang's husband?": [

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. He was also one of the great portraitists of his time. Goya was born to a lower- middle- class family in 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14 under Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace. He was guarded, and although letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He suffered a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799 Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara, the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his\" La maja desnuda\", a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. In 1801 he painted\" Charles IV of Spain and His Family\", also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez. In 1807 Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not vocalise his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his\" Disasters of War\" series of prints( although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings\" The Second of May 1808\" and\" The Third of May 1808\". Other works from his mid-period include the\" Caprichos\" and\" Los Disparates\" etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health. His late period culminates with the\" Black Paintings\" of 1819 \u2013 1823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo(\" House of the Deaf Man\") where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may or may not have been his lover. There he completed his\" La Tauromaquia\" series and a number of other, major, canvases. Following a stroke which left him paralyzed on his right side, and suffering failing eyesight and poor access to painting materials, he died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82. His body was later re-interred in the Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. Famously, the skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back,\" Send Goya, with or without head.\"\nDocument[3](Title: Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky) Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky (3 February 1959 \u2013 28 June 2006) was an Argentine film director born in Buenos Aires.

Charles was the youngest son of Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I and Ermengarde of Tours. His father divided Middle Francia between his three sons: the eldest, Louis, received Italy and the emperorship; Lothair II received Lotharingia (modern Lorraine, the Low Countries, and Upper Burgundy); and the youngest, Charles, received Lower Burgundy (Arles and Provence). Charles was only a child when his father died; and the governance of his realm was undertaken by his tutor, Count Gerard II of Vienne, whose wife had been a sister-in-law of Emperor Lothar I. Gerard was a vigorous regent, defending the kingdom from the Northmen, who raided up the Rhone as far as Valence. In 860, he ejected them from the Rhone delta. Charles' uncle, Charles the Bald of West Francia, attempted to intervene in Provence in 861. After receiving an appeal for intervention from the Count of Arles, he invaded Provence, but only reached Macon, being restrained by Hincmar of Rheims. Charles of Provence never ruled his realm in anything more than name. It was Gerard, rather than he, who in 858 arranged that should Charles die without children, Provence would revert to Charles' brother Lothair II. However, when Charles died, his elder brother Emperor Louis II also claimed Provence, so the realm was divided between the two: Lothair received the bishoprics of Lyon, Vienne and Grenoble, to be governed by Gerard; Louis II received Arles, Aix and Embrun.\nDocument[2](Title: George Louis, Prince of Erbach-Sch\u00f6nberg) George Louis, Prince of Erbach- Sch\u00f6nberg( 1 January 190327 January 1971) was the 3rd Prince of Erbach- Sch\u00f6nberg, elder son of Alexander, 2nd Prince of Erbach- Sch\u00f6nberg.\nDocument[3](Title: Prince Jacques, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans) Prince Jacques of Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans,\" fils de France\"( Jacques Jean Jaroslaw Marie; born 25 June 1941 in Rabat, Morocco), is the son of Henri, Count of Paris( the Orl\u00e9anist claimant to the French throne from 1940 until his death) and his wife, Princess Isabelle of Orl\u00e9ans- Braganza.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Prince Charles Louis, Duke Of Chartres born?": [

Highlights include: Hosts for the third installment in the\" That's Entertainment!\" series were Gene Kelly( in his last film appearance), June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, and Esther Williams, making her first appearance in a theatrical film in more than 30 years. \" That's Entertainment!

He studied under filmmaker Richard Leacock, one of the pioneers of direct cinema and Cin\u00e9ma V\u00e9rit\u00e9 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he graduated with a B.S. in Art and Design. On several of his independent films he is credited both as a director, producer and writer and on occasion as \"Rafael Zelinsky\" and/or \"Rafal Haimovitz\". His early years were spent in Eastern Europe. Born of a Polish father, an engineer and a pioneer in pre-fabricated housing, and mother of Jewish roots, an architect, his childhood was spent in several countries where his father worked for the Ford Foundation. While in grade-school he travelled several times around the world and gained a global perspective, an 8mm camera always at his eye. He was schooled in North America, the Middle East and the Orient. During high-school he attended Stowe School in England where he received the Duke of Edinburgh Award enabling him to make his first documentary film about the temples in Southern India.

After graduating from MIT he went on to direct several award-winning documentaries, gradually moving towards drama and becoming more and more interested in story-telling. As an independent filmmaker, Zielinski has always generated his own projects either by creating an original story that he was passionate about then collaborating with several screenwriters or adapting works from the theater in collaboration with the respective playwright. On most of the independent films that he directed he also served as his own producer often producing through his own company. His first feature \"Hey Babe\" opened the Taormina Film Festival, and showed at Toronto, Montreal and AFI Film Festival. \"Fun\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received two Special Jury Awards for Acting Achievement and went on to show at the Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver as well as other international film festivals including Sydney, Edinburgh, Munich, Vienna, London, Cambridge, Stockholm, S\u00e3o Paulo, Hawaii, Hamburg, Rimini, Mill Valley, San Jose, Warsaw, Oslo and Wales.

His latest two indie films are \"Bohemia\", a love story set in Prague starring Troy Garity (Fonda) (\"BanditsSoldier\u2019s TaleBarbershop\") and Czech actress Klara Issova and \"Age of Kali\", written by Los Angeles playwright John Steppling (playwright), a dark psychological study of decadence and illumination set in Los Angeles. In the mainstream arena he has directed numerous popular genre projects ranging from the Roger Corman financed \"Screwballs\" (which generated three sequels which Zielinski directed as well), to Fox Searchlight \u2019s Frank Peretti written \"Hangman\u2019s Curse\", in which he gave Leighton Meester (\u201cGossip Girl\u201d) her first starring role, as well as numerous TV shows such as \u201cHighlander\u201d and \u201cPoltergeist\u201d. He is currently focusing on three projects: \"Tiger Within\" (written by Gina Wendkos), a story about the relationship between a Holocaust survivor and a teen skin head girl, \"ALieNS\", a large-scale science fiction romance, and \"Bardo\", a life-after-death story based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

The film is based on Clare Boothe Luce's play of the same name, and was adapted for the screen by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin, who had to make the film acceptable for the Production Code for it to be released. The film stars Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, Lucile Watson, Mary Boland, Florence Nash, and Virginia Grey, as well as Marjorie Main and Phyllis Povah, the last two of whom reprised their stage roles from the play. Ruth Hussey, Virginia Weidler, Butterfly McQueen, and Hedda Hopper also appeared in smaller roles. Fontaine was the last surviving actress with a credited role in the film; she died in 2013. The film continued the play's all- female tradition\u2014 the entire cast of more than 130 speaking roles was female. Set in the glamorous Manhattan apartments of high society evoked by Cedric Gibbons, and in Reno, Nevada, where they obtain their divorces, it presents an acidic commentary on the pampered lives and power struggles of various rich, bored wives and other women they come into contact with. Throughout\" The Women\", not a single male is seen \u2014 although the males are much talked about, and the central theme is the women's relationships with them. Lesbianism is intimated in the portrayal of only one character, Nancy Blake(\" I am an old maid, a frozen asset.\"). The attention to detail was such that even in props such as portraits, only female figures are represented, and several animals which appeared as pets were also female. The only exceptions are a poster- drawing clearly of a bull in the fashion show segment, a framed portrait of Stephen Haines as a boy, a figurine on Mary's night stand, and an ad on the back of the magazine Peggy reads at Mary's house before lunch. Filmed in black and white, it includes a 6- minute fashion parade filmed in Technicolor, featuring Adrian's most\" outr\u00e9\" designs; often cut in modern screenings, it has been restored by Turner Classic Movies.

The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936.

They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas.

The film stars Jonathan Pryce and features Robert De Niro, Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins and Ian Holm. The film centres on Sam Lowry, a man trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines. \"Brazil\"s satire of bureaucratic, totalitarian government is reminiscent of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and has been called Kafkaesque and absurdist. Sarah Street's \"British National Cinema\" (1997) describes the film as a \"fantasy/satire on bureaucratic society\"; and John Scalzi's \"Rough Guide to Sci-Fi Movies\" (2005) describes it as a \"dystopian satire\". Jack Mathews, a film critic and the author of \"The Battle of Brazil\" (1987), described the film as \"satirizing the bureaucratic, largely dysfunctional industrial world that had been driving Gilliam crazy all his life\". The film is named after the recurrent theme song, Ary Barroso's \"Aquarela do Brasil\", known simply as \"Brazil\" to British audiences, as performed by Geoff Muldaur. Though a success in Europe, the film was unsuccessful in its initial North America release. It has since become a cult film. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted \"Brazil\" the 54th greatest British film of all time. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for \"Time Out\" magazine saw it ranked the 24th best British film ever.\nDocument[3](Title: Jos\u00e9 A.

He was also sometimes credited as production designer. Ferreyra was born in Vicente L\u00f3pez, Gran Buenos Aires. He began simultaneously directing and screenwriting for film in 1915, and moved on to success directing films such as\" Palomas rubias\" in 1920. His films tended to focus on lower- class family drama, most notably\" Perd\u00f3n, viejita\"( 1927), and were filmed on a low budget and with little to no script as a guide. Ferreyra prevailes through the 1920s and 1930s as a distinguished filmmaker of the masses, but was displaced in the late 1930s and early 1940s by big budget cinema. He directed over 40 films and wrote the scripts for the majority of them between 1915 and 1941, working with noted actors such as Libertad Lamarque and Mario Soffici on his screen debut, before moving on to directing. He died on 29 January 1943 from throat cancer.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, Buffet Froid or Lost In Africa?": [

Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score.

It was Velasco Maidana's first film, and would have been the second ever Bolivian- made fiction feature released, just after Pedro Sambarino's\" Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\"( 1925). Set in contemporary Bolivia, it was a love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. Scheduled for release on July 28, it was censored and cancelled by the authorities, due to its\" social critique\"( highlighting the condition of indigenous Bolivians) and the controversial idea of a white woman falling in love with an indigenous man. The government ordered Velasco Maidana to surrender the film to be burned; in a 1979 interview, the director and his wife recalled that he threatened to burn himself along with his work. He managed to hide it in the walls of his house. Velasco Maidana subsequently directed\" Wara Wara\"( 1930), which was accepted by censors as it reversed the gender roles and moved the setting to the sixteenth century, portraying the love of a conquistador for an Inca princess. \" The Prophecy of the Lake\" is a lost film, as there are no known copies of it in existence;\" Wara Wara\" is the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent- film era.\n\nQuestion: What is the date of death of the director of film Esc\u00e1ndalo De Estrellas?": [

The Vernon Dalhart version was recorded on Victor Records in October 1924 and marketed in the hillbilly music genre. It was likely one of the best-selling records of the early 20th century. Although contemporary data show that Victor pressed slightly over 1.3 million copies during the record's peak years of popularity, anecdotal accounts sourced from a 1940s promotional flyer report sales as high as 7 million. The song's publisher at the time, Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., reportedly sold over one million copies of the song's sheet music. It was later performed by, among others, Hank Snow, Bill Monroe, and Brenda Lee. The first verse was sung by Liberace at the end of an episode of the 1960s television show \"Batman\" in which Liberace played the double role of twin criminal brothers, both of whom ended the episode behind bars. The song was mentioned in the book M*A*S*H * (1968) by Richard Hooker. It was parodied by the two main characters simulating being in jail outside the commander's tent. They sang: \"If we had the wings of a Colonel, We'd fly to the high Pyrenees, And open an open air laundry, Specializing in Blake's B.V.D.'s. \" It may also have been expanded in the stage adaptation of the book. The song was included in Lyle Kessler's play \"Orphans\" and the film adaptation of the same name which the character of Harold drunkenly mumbles. The verse sung was altered to \"if I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly, Straight to the arms of my mutter, and then I'd be willing to die\". The song was an influence on Albert E. Brumley's popular hymn, \"I'll Fly Away\" (1929).\nDocument[3](Title: The Singer of All Songs) The Singer of All Songs is the first novel in the Chanters of Tremaris trilogy by Kate Constable.\n\nQuestion: Where was the composer of film Terror In The Aisles born?": [

Husz\u00e1rik was born in the small village of Domony, Hungary. His father died when he was two years old. Being an only child, Husz\u00e1rik had an adoring relationship with his widowed mother. His background had a great influence on his work. He was accepted to the Hungarian School of Film- and Theatrical Arts, but was expelled in 1952 because his family was blamed to be Kulaks. He took on different jobs, when\u2014after a seven- year hiatus \u2014he was again accepted to the film school in 1959. In the same year he made his first student film, a short entitled\" J\u00e1t\u00e9kGame\") about two prisoners playing chess with the shadow of their bars when the sun shines unto their cell. Husz\u00e1rik's graduation film was another short entitled\" GroteszkGrotesque\") in 1963 about a strange train voyage of an artist carrying his own picture. Husz\u00e1rik made his first professional short film in 1965 at B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs Studios entitled\" El\u00e9giaElegy\"). This 20- minute experimental short film was generally acclaimed as being the starting point of a new visual style in Hungarian filmmaking. Often called a\" film poem\" or a\" film symphonie\" Husz\u00e1rik's masterpiece consists of montages of horses from the dawn of time to the modern times from cave paintings to horse races, mourning the loss of these creatures and their service to mankind, starting as free animals and becoming slaughterhouse victims. The film is generally regarded as an allegory to the human fate. Husz\u00e1rik made another experimental short film called\" Capriccio\"( about snowmen melting in the spring as an allegory to man's ultimate fate- death) and a short documentary on Hungarian- born artist\" Amerigo Tot\", both in 1969. He also directed several state- financed educational short films in this period. In 1971 Husz\u00e1rik finished his first feature- length work\" Szindb\u00e1d Sinbad\"), a highly stylized adaptation of early 20th century author Gyula Kr\u00fady's short stories. The film depicts the life and memories of traveler and womanizer Szindb\u00e1d( played by Zolt\u00e1n Latinovits), who tries to recover his lost love before he dies. The film which covers time and memory in an unusual way, was praised by critics and was a commercial success upon its release and is generally regarded now as one of the best works of Hungarian cinema. Husz\u00e1rik made two experimental shorts in 1971 and 1976, entitled\" Tisztelet az \u00f6regasszonyoknakHomage to Old Ladies\") and\" A Piacere As You Like It\"), respectively. The first is a homage to the old country widows whose husbands died in World War II and live their lives according to daily tasks and regulations until they die( which is mainly inspired by Husz\u00e1rik's own mother). The second is a study of death in its various forms, including a gypsy\" merry funeral\" and stock footage of bombings and concentration camps in WWII. The second( and last) feature- length film of Husz\u00e1rik was made after a five- year struggle. \" Csontv\u00e1ry\" depicts the life of Hungarian artist Tivadar Csontv\u00e1ry Kosztka and an actor playing him in a film( both played by Bulgarian actor Ichak Finci), with the two men' lives interacting with each other. After the death of Latinovits, who was the original choice for the dual role, the film went on through several re-writes, re-shoots, casting and budget problems, finally ending up as the most expensive Hungarian production at the time. The film was finally completed and released in 1980. It was a huge failure with the public and critics also bashed it. Husz\u00e1rik who was greatly exhausted, depressed and an alcoholic at the time committed suicide in 1981 at the age of 50. Husz\u00e1rik originally wanted to be a visual artist. He made several paintings, drawings and other pieces of art during his lifetime. He also took smaller acting jobs in the films of fellow Hungarian directors, including Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3's\" Budapesti mes\u00e9kBudapest Tales\"). His daughter, Kata Husz\u00e1rik is an acclaimed actress.\nDocument[3](Title: El Muerto (film)) El Muerto( alternatively, The Dead One, El Muerto: The Dead One, The Dead One: El Muerto, The Dead One: An American Legend) is a live- action independent film adaptation of the comic book series, created by Javier Hernandez.

Based on Neil Simon's 1963 play of the same name, it focuses on newlyweds Corie and Paul Bratter and their adventures living in a minuscule sixth floor walk-up apartment in a Greenwich Village brownstone. Stuffed-shirt Paul is a hard-working young attorney just starting his practice, while spontaneous bride Corie is determined to create a romantic environment in one room with no heat, a hole in the skylight, and oddball neighbors. The title refers to Corie's lamentation that Paul will not go running barefoot in Washington Square Park with her because of his sober and cautious demeanor. The phrase becomes emblematic of the differences between the two of them, and is made manifest in the film's climactic scene. The film's screenplay was written by Simon. Gene Saks directed Redford, reprising his Broadway role of Paul, and Fonda, who replaced the play's Elizabeth Ashley.

He was one of the founders of the musical genre later defined as Western swing. Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self- teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down,\" Blues in the Bottle\" was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old- time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album,\" Times Ai n\u2019t Like They Used to Be, Volume 1\" along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was\" Wake Up, Jacob\" which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith,\" Anthology of American Folk Music\", in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song,\" Oklahoma Rag\" was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled\" Memories of Prince Albert Hunt\" was released and was centered on the musician's life.\n\nQuestion: Where did George Lane-Fox (Mp)'s father study?": [

He died of stomach cancer on 3 June 1963, four and a half years after his election and two months after the completion of his final and famed encyclical, Pacem in terris. He was buried in the Vatican grottoes beneath Saint Peter's Basilica on 6 June 1963 and his cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by his successor, Pope Paul VI, who declared him a Servant of God.

On 5 July 2013, Pope Francis \u2013 bypassing the traditionally required second miracle \u2013 declared John XXIII a saint, after unanimous agreement by a consistory, or meeting, of the College of Cardinals, based on the fact that he was considered to have lived a virtuous, model lifestyle, and because of the good for the Church which had come from his having opened the Second Vatican Council.

Otto III then ruled alone, until his death, the following year. The reign of these two Ascanian Margraves was characterized by an expansion of the Margraviate, which annexed the remaining parts of Teltow and Barnim, the Uckermark, the Lordship of Stargard, the Lubusz Land and parts of the Neumark east of the Oder. They consolidated the position of Brandenburg within the Holy Roman Empire, which was reflected in the fact that in 1256, Otto III was a candidate to be elected King of the Germans. They founded several cities and developed the twin cities of C\u00f6lln and Berlin. They expanded the Ascanian castle in nearby Spandau and made it their preferred residence. Before their death, they divided the Margraviate in a \"Johannine\" and an \"Ottonian\" part. The Ascanians were traditionally buried in the Lehnin Abbey in the Ottonian part of the country. In 1258, they founded a Cistercian monastery named \"Mariensee\", where members of the Johannine line could be buried. In 1266, they changed their mind and founded a second monastery, named \"Chorin\", 8 km southwest of Mariensee. John was initially buried at Mariensee; his body was moved to Chorin in 1273. After the Ottonian line died out in 1317, John I's grandson Waldemar reunited the Margraviate.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Christiane Vulpius's husband?": [

Meanwhile, Alexios II decided for himself to marry Djiadjak Jaqeli, a Georgian princess. His uncle Andronikos II, who had been appointed his guardian by his father, wanted this marriage annulled; he had planned for Alexios to marry the daughter of the high court official Nikephoros Choumnos. Eudokia used the pretext of inducing her son to dissolve the marriage to obtain her brother's permission to return to Trebizond in 1301; upon arriving, she instead advised her son to keep his Georgian wife. Eudokia died in the following year, and William Miller speculates she was buried in the church of Saint Gregory of Nyssa. Anthony Bryer has proposed that a Eudokia, who became a nun by the monastic name Euphemia, mentioned in a painted inscription recorded by Fallmerayer from the Panagia Theoskepastos Monastery, may have been Eudokia Palaologina. This Eudokia has not been satisfactorily proven to be a member of the house of the Great Komnenoi, and Bryer offers a number of objections to any identification. He notes that there is \"a strong independent local nineteenth-century tradition\" that Eudokia founded the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa before her death. Lastly, Bryer notes that \"it would not be surprising if she would have wished to put not only distance but a nun's veil between herself and her brother's ruthless and alarming marital plans (which included Mongol and Turkish alliances for other female members of his family) before she died in 1302.\"\n\nQuestion: Who is Constantine Palaiologos (Son Of Andronikos Ii)'s maternal grandmother?": [

Her works included the novels\" Fortunata\"( 1911),\" The Dust of the Road\"( 1913), about her experiences acting in London, and\" A Woman's Man\"( 1919). \" Publishers Weekly\" provided this summary of\" Fortunata\" in 1911: \" Fortunata is the granddaughter of an old Roman Princess and lives in a great Roman palace. When about 18 she begins to have her own way. She spends money lavishly, associates with most unhealthy companions for a young girl. Finally she drifts to England and marries a very rich man and is forced to live with his hum- drum mother and daughters. The Italian wife remains erratic and the end is tragedy.\" H.L. Mencken gave the book a positive review. Patterson's theatre roles included playing the title role in\" Pierrot the Prodigal\"( which played at the Booth Theatre in New York and was produced by Winthrop Ames and Walter Knight), and in the one- act\" Pan in Ambush\", which she wrote. She also acted for a few years in England. Reporting on her in the 1910s places her birth year around 1891, though it is likely she was a few years older as it was not uncommon for actresses to claim a younger age. Attention to her doings dropped off by about 1922, and there is little subsequent mention of her after that time. Patterson was the only daughter of Wilson Patterson and Margaret Sherwood. Her grandfather was author and critic John Neal, and her great- aunt was Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, sister- in- law of Napoleon. She lived her later years in New York City where she died of hepatitis.\nDocument[2](Title: Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves) Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves is a folk tale included in many versions of\" One Thousand and One Nights\".

It is one of the most familiar of the\" Arabian Nights\" tales, and has been widely retold and performed in many media, especially for children, where the more violent aspects of the story are often suppressed. In the story, Ali Baba is a poor woodcutter who discovers the secret of a thieves' den, entered with the phrase\" Open Sesame\". The thieves learn this and try to kill Ali Baba, but Ali Baba's faithful slave- girl foils their plots. Ali Baba gives his son to her in marriage and keeps the secret of the treasure.\nDocument[3](Title: J'ai Rencontr\u00e9 Le P\u00e8re No\u00ebl) J'ai rencontr\u00e9 le P\u00e8re No\u00ebl( English: I Met Father Christmas) is a 1984 French science fiction fantasy film directed by Christian Gion and co-written with Didier Kaminka.

The film stars Karen Cheryl, who was a popular singer at the time in France, as both Simon's schoolteacher and as the Fairy. She acts and sings musical numbers in the film. Clearly designed for children, the film was primarily meant as a family comedy for the Christmas holidays. It is an opportunity for Cheryl to repeatedly sing simplistic melodies, in line with the plot.

He reigned from 180 to 164 BC and from 163 to 145 BC. The eldest son of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I of Egypt, he came to the throne as a very young child in 180 BC and the kingdom was governed by regents: his mother until her death in 178 or 177 BC and then two of her associates, Eulaeus and Lenaeus until 169 BC. From 170 BC, his sister-wife Cleopatra II and his younger brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes were co-rulers alongside him. Ptolemy VI's reign was characterised by external conflict with the Seleucid empire over Syria and by internal conflict with his younger brother for control of the Ptolemaic monarchy. In the Sixth Syrian War (170-168 BC), the Ptolemaic forces were utterly defeated and Egypt was twice invaded by Seleucid armies. His attempts to negotiate an end to this conflict exacerbated the conflict with his brother. Though he managed to collaborate with his brother for long enough to secure peace and re-establish order within Egypt, Ptolemy VIII succeeded in expelling Ptolemy VI from Egypt in 164 BC. The people of Alexandria turned against Ptolemy VIII and invited Ptolemy VI back to the throne in 163 BC. In this second reign he was much more successful in both conflicts. He banished his brother to Cyrenaica and repeatedly prevented him from using that as a springboard to taking Cyprus, despite substantial Roman intervention in his brother's favour. By supporting a series of rival claimants for the Seleucid throne, Ptolemy VI helped instigate a civil war in the Seleucid realm, which would continue for generations and eventually consume the Seleucid dynasty. In 145 BC, Ptolemy invaded Seleucid Syria and won a total victory at the Battle of the Oenoparus, which left him in charge of both the Seleucid and Ptolemaic realms. However, injuries that he sustained in the battle led to his death three days later. The gains from the war were almost immediately lost and his brother Ptolemy VIII returned to power.\nDocument[3](Title: Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani) The Tomb of Mariam- uz- Zamani is the mausoleum of Mariam- uz- Zamani, the Queen consort of the Mughal Emperor Akbar.

It was the last work that Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise worked on together before Morecambe's death in 1984 (the comedian being in poor health at the time of filming). It was written as a pastiche of the works of various writers including Agatha Christie and Edgar Wallace, and is set in 1946\u2014featuring Morecambe and Wise ostensibly as 1940s versions of themselves. The duo's move from the BBC to Thames in 1978 was a much publicised media event, and one of the main reasons for their move was to make films and move away from the format of the \"Morecambe & Wise Show\" that had proved so popular in the previous decade. The film was completed in late 1983, but not shown until after Morecambe's death the following year. It was originally made with a laughter track, but this was absent when broadcast, and again so when later released on both VHS and DVD. The film features a plot of family members dying in strange circumstances and the two leads are drawn into this when Eric's niece Kathy (Lysette Anthony) is visited by the family's lawyer, played by Fulton Mackay. It was made largely on location, produced on videotape, and was originally broadcast on ITV on 3 January 1985. The closing moments of the film see Eric and Ernie walking off together, onto the next gig, making it their final screen image together.\nDocument[3](Title: The General Died at Dawn) The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China. This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.

Directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund, the film premiered on MTV on October 21, 2005, and was released on DVD on June 20, 2006, by Warner Bros. Records. The documentary was originally called \"The Re-Invented Process\", referencing the tour and the Steven Klein exhibition titled \"X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS\". It starts with imagery from the exhibition and Madonna auditioning dancers for the tour, continues with her entourage travelling through different cities and performing, the singer's introspection on her life, her marriage, her religion, and her children, and ends with Madonna's visit to Israel in the midst of protests. The documentary was inspired by Madonna's need to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's personal views on life and spirituality. Like \"Truth or Dare\", the performance scenes were shot in color, while the rest of the film was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, \u00c5kerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London was used for some sequences. The film features appearances from Madonna's father, stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore. Before releasing the documentary, Madonna invited a select group of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill. The film was trimmed after negative feedback regarding excessive details about Kabbalah. For the promotion and premiere of the film, Madonna appeared at Q&A sessions with the press and also gave a speech to film students at New York's Hunter College. Critical response to \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was mixed, with reviewers complimenting the live performances and the scenes involving her children and family, but criticizing the self-indulgent and preachy nature. \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. It received a positive response from critics but was a moderate success commercially.\nDocument[3](Title: Julien Donkey-Boy) Julien Donkey-Boy is a 1999 American drama film written and directed by Harmony Korine.

According to the contemporary chronicler Otto of Freising, Henry was \"a valiant man, experienced in the councils of warfortem et exercitatum in bellicis consiliis virum\"). Henry was the eldest son of Duke Ulrich I and Judith, daughter of Margrave Hermann II of Baden. He married Elizabeth, widow of Count Rudolf II of Stade and daughter of Margrave Leopold of Styria, but their marriage was childless. He succeeded his father while still a youth. In 1147 his rich uncle, Count Bernard of Trixen, bequeathed his allods and his \"ministeriales\" (high-status serfs) in Carinthia and in the Styrian \"Mark an der Drau\" to Margrave Ottokar III of Styria. In 1151 another uncle, Hermann III of Baden, was invested with the march of Verona, which had been held by the dukes of Carinthia since 976. Henry is not known to have objected to the loss of this large territory in northern Italy. In 1158 Bishop Roman I of Gurk granted the bailiwick (secular protection) of his diocese to Henry, but this was a small gain for a prince whose territory was dominated by estates with non-resident lords both ecclesiastical and secular. Henry took part in the wars of the Emperor Frederick I in northern Italy in 1154\u201355 and 1158\u201360. Otto of Freising lists him among the most distinguished who returned home with the emperor's permission in mid-1155. Otto's continuator, Rahewin, reports that during the 1158 campaign, Henry and Duke Henry II of Austria were given command of the Hungarian contingent of 600 archers, with their \"counts and barons\", which marched through the Val Canale into the march of Verona, the route known as the \"via Canalis\". Henry was a member of the embassy Frederick sent to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I in 1160\u201361. Henry was probably sent because his brother, Margrave Engelbert III of Istria was married to Matilda of Sulzbach, a sister of Manuel's wife, the Empress Irene. While returning, Henry drowned in the mouth of the Tagliamento river. His body was buried in the abbey of Rosazzo. He was succeeded by his brother, Hermann II.\nDocument[2](Title: Henry King (director)) Henry King( January 24, 1886 June 29, 1982) was an American actor and film director.

The film stars Christina Ricci and Jesse Eisenberg as two estranged siblings attacked by a werewolf loose in Los Angeles. Originally planned for 2003, the film is a notable example of development hell, taking over two more years to be made than originally planned, during which producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein kept asking for reshoots and changes to the plot, re-edited the movie to give a PG- 13 rating rather than the original intended R-rating, and fired legendary makeup artist Rick Baker to replace the werewolves he had created with computer- generated ones. The film was a box- office failure and was panned by critics; Craven himself was very displeased with the final result.\nDocument[3](Title: The Beast Must Die (1974 film)) The Beast Must Die is a British horror film directed by Paul Annett. The screenplay was written by Michael Winder, based on the short story \"There Shall Be No Darkness\" by James Blish which was originally published in Thrilling Wonder Stories. The film starred Calvin Lockhart, Peter Cushing, Marlene Clark, Michael Gambon, Charles Gray, Anton Diffring, Ciaran Madden, and Tom Chadbon. The story is, in essence, a conflation of Agatha Christie\u2019s \" And Then There Were None\" (a.k.a. \"Ten Little Indians\") and Richard Connell\u2019s \"The Most Dangerous Game\", with elements of the werewolf mythos stirred in for good measure. It revolves around the search for a werewolf on a far-off island by a group of serious minded people out to find it. The viewer is invited to unfold the mystery along with the characters. Near the ending, there is an inserted 30-second break called the \"werewolf break\", where the audience is asked to guess the werewolf's identity, based on clues from the movie. In the interview with director Annett on the DVD release, Annett says he hated the addition of the werewolf break. It was not in Annett's version of the film; he attributes the idea to producer Milton Subotsky. He does admit that some, including critic Leonard Maltin, liked it. An alternate version of the film was released under the title Black Werewolf. This cut omits the \"werewolf break\" near the climax.\n\nQuestion: Where did the director of film The Boy Who Cried Werewolf (1973 Film) die?": [

Nicknamed the\" Father of Rock and Roll\", Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as\" Maybellene\"( 1955),\" Roll Over Beethoven\"( 1956),\" Rock and Roll Music\"( 1957) and\" Johnny B. Goode\"( 1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle- class African- American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T- Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded\" Maybellene\" \u2014 Berry's adaptation of the country song\" Ida Red\" \u2014 which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on\" Billboard\" magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. However, he was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act\u2014he had transported a 14- year- old girl across state lines. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including\" No Particular Place to GoYou Never Can Tell\", and\" Nadine\". But these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. However, in 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of\" My Ding- a- Ling\" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four- month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion. Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having\" laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance.\" Berry is included in several of\" Rolling Stone\" magazine's\" greatest of all time\" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry's:\" Johnny B. GoodeMaybellene\", and\" Rock and Roll Music\". Berry's\" Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock- and- roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.\nDocument[2](Title: Percy Wenrich) Percy Wenrich (January 23, 1887 \u2013 March 17, 1952) was a United States composer of ragtime and popular music. Born in Joplin, Missouri to Daniel Wenrich and Mary Ray, he left for Chicago in 1901 where he attended classes at the Chicago Musical College. Wenrich moved on to New York City around 1907 to work as a Tin Pan Alley composer, but his music retains a Missouri folk flavor. He composed at least eighteen rags, including \"Ashy Africa,Noodles,Peaches and Cream\" (1905), \"Crab Apples,\" and \"The Smiler\" (1907). His songs include \"Wabash Avenue After Dark\" and the hits \"Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet\" (1909, lyrics by Stanley Murphy), \"When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose\" (1914, lyrics by Jack Mahoney) and \"Minnetonka\" (1921, lyrics by Gus Kahn). \"If It's Good Enough for Washington It's Good Enough for Me\" (1908, lyrics by Ren Shields) was a song about a homeless man sleeping on a bench in a public square with statues of Washington, Jefferson, McKinley, Grant and Lee. Wenrich married vaudeville performer Dolly Connolly and in 1911 wrote the hit \"Red Rose Rag\" for her with lyrics by Edward Madden. In 1912, Wenrich and Madden had another hit with \"Moonlight Bay. \" Wenrich and Connolly toured together for many years. In the late 1930s, Wenrich and several of his fellow hitmakers formed a sensational review called \"Songwriters on Parade\", performing all across the Eastern seaboard on the Loew's and Keith circuits.

However over the years, the film has been appreciated by the audiences in its screening in television and has gained a cult following over the years. Rajesh Khanna and Raj Kapoor starred in this movie, set in 1944\u20131947. \"Naukri\"s basic idea is based on the 1955 Tamil film \"Mudhal Thethi\", starring Sivaji Ganeshan and Anjali Devi. The other inspiration for this film was \"It's a Wonderful Life\", produced and directed by Frank Capra. The story features a person getting help of an angel after his death. However, the story and treatment in this film are completely different form both of these films. The God-sent person makes the hero realize that when he was alive he was so important and loved by all around him but he couldn\u2019t recognize it.

Already a prominent artist, he was arrested in 1941 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. His camp number was 15261. In the camp he drew about 300 paintings depicting the everyday life of prisoners. His work is currently displayed in the Auschwitz- Birkenau State Museum. During his imprisonment in Auschwitz, he met fellow prisoner Bronislaw Czech, a three- time Polish Olympian, and helped refine Czech's artistic talents. He also befriended Maximilian Kolbe, a Catholic priest who died in Auschwitz and was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1982. At the end of the War in May, 1945, he was liberated by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Group at the Ebensee Concentration Camp in Austria, near the town of Seewaichen on the Atter Kammer See. He painted a number of portraits of U.S. military personnel at that time, including one of Colonel James H Polk, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Group( now in the possession of Col. Polk's family). Ko\u015bcielniak became a member of the Association of European Culture( SEC), and was awarded the National Education Committee Medal, the Gold Cross of Merit, and the Medal in the Service of Polish Education. After the war, Ko\u015bcielniak moved to Warsaw, then to Ustka in 1979 and finally, in 1989, to S\u0142upsk. He died in 1993 and is buried at the Ustka cemetery.

He remains a controversial figure in Polish history. Recognized as a great patron of the arts and sciences and an initiator and firm supporter of progressive reforms, he is also remembered as the King of the Commonwealth whose election was marred by Russian intervention. He is criticized primarily for his failure to stand against the partitions, and thus to prevent the destruction of the Polish state. Having arrived at the Russian imperial court in Saint Petersburg in 1755, he became romantically involved with the future empress Catherine the Great. With her connivance, in 1764 he was elected King of Poland. Contrary to expectations, he attempted to reform and strengthen the ailing Commonwealth. His efforts met with external opposition from Prussia, Russia and Austria, all committed to keeping the Commonwealth weak. From within he was opposed by conservative interests, which saw reforms as threatening their traditional liberties and privileges. The defining crisis of his early reign was the War of the Bar Confederation (1768\u20131772) that led to the First Partition of Poland (1772). The later part of his reign saw reforms wrought by the Great Sejm (1788\u20131792) and the Constitution of 3 May 1791. These reforms were overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792, leading directly to the Second Partition of Poland (1793), the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising (1794) and the final and Third Partition of Poland (1795), marking the end of the Commonwealth. Stripped of all meaningful power, Poniatowski abdicated in November 1795 and spent the last years of his life a virtual captive in Saint Petersburg.\n\nQuestion: Which country Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620\u20131659)'s father is from?": [

Lee was the son of Sir Francis Henry Lee, 2nd Baronet, of Quarrendon, Buckinghamshire, and his wife Hon.

Murray was born at Edinburgh, Scotland, the daughter of Henry Home- Drummond, of Blair Drummond, by Christian, daughter of Charles Moray. On 29 October 1839 she married George Murray, 2nd Baron Glenlyon, at Blair Drummond, thereby becoming Lady Glenlyon. In 1846 he succeeded his uncle as sixth Duke of Atholl, and Anne became Duchess of Atholl. She served as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria in Lord Derby's short- lived government of 1852. She subsequently served the queen as a Lady of the Bedchamber for almost forty years and was one of Victoria's closest friends. When The Prince Consort died, the Queen came out of the room where he had died and proclaimed,\" Oh, Duchess, he is dead!\" The Duke of Atholl died in 1864, and Anne became the Dowager Duchess of Atholl. In 1892, when Gladstone again came to power, his policy of Home Rule for Ireland had alienated many of the upper classes, and no lady of ducal rank could be found who was willing to serve as Mistress of the Robes. The post therefore remained vacant, while the Dowager Duchess of Atholl and the Duchess of Roxburghe performed the duties of the office. The duchess and her husband preferred the spelling\" Athole\" for their title and residence. The Duke and Duchess had one child, John Stewart- Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl. The Duchess of Atholl died at Dunkeld, Perthshire, in May 1897, aged 82, and was buried at Blair Atholl.\nDocument[3](Title: Richard Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel) Richard Granville Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel (12 September 1866 \u2013 16 November 1931), known as Viscount Ennismore from 1866 to 1924, was an Irish peer and British Army officer.

His taste for pastoral and bucolic genre scenes resulted in paintings such as \"Blind man's buff\" (in Spanish, \"La gallina ciega\"), clearly influenced by Watteau and itself a clear influence on Goya's oil on linen cartoon of the same name. In his later years he came into friction over works for the royal court with his fellow French artist Jean Ranc.\n\nQuestion: Do director of film Coteau Rouge and director of film Hochelaga, Land Of Souls share the same nationality?": [

The band originally formed in Hertfordshire in late 1965 as The Little People, and comprised Angus Shirley( lead guitar), Peter\" Dino\" Dines( organ, vocals), Bob Argent( bass), and Angus' younger brother Jerry Shirley( drums). They began by playing covers of American R&B records, and emulated the music of their heroes, The Small Faces. After they supported the latter band on a local bill, Steve Marriott became their mentor, and persuaded Andrew Loog Oldham of Immediate Records to sign them in early 1967. Marriott wanted them to change their name to The Nice, but Oldham insisted on them using the name The Apostolic Intervention, giving the name The Nice to another band instead. Marriott offered the band a song that he and Ronnie Lane had written,\" Tell Me( Have You Ever Seen Me)\", producing their single and playing bass on the record in preference to Bob Argent. The record failed to make the charts, and the song was soon recorded by The Small Faces themselves on their album\" Small Faces\"( issued in the US in a different form as\" There are But Four Small Faces\"). Further attempts at recording The Apostolic Intervention were unsuccessful, and the band split up before the end of 1967. Dines and Jerry Shirley joined Tim Renwick in a band known variously as Little Women and the Wages of Sin. Dines later joined the Keef Hartley Band and T.

The only extant historical source about her life is her biography written by her maternal grandson, Xiahou Zhan( \u590f\u4faf\u6e5b), who was a notable scholar and official of the Jin dynasty.

At that time, Ma Yin had just taken control of Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan) following the assassination of Ma Yin's predecessor Liu Jianfeng, and was not yet fully in control of Wu'an Circuit (\u6b66\u5b89, headquartered at Tan Prefecture), which would eventually become the central circuit for the Chu state, but was in the process of gradually consolidating his control. Ma Xifan's mother was a Lady Chen, who was Ma Yin's concubine, not his wife \u2014 as Ma Yin's first son, Ma Xizhen (\u99ac\u5e0c\u632f), was said to be born of his wife, who was not named in historical sources. (Lady Chen later bore at least one younger son among Ma Yin's at least 35 sons, Ma Xiguang.) Ma Xifan and his brother, Ma Yin's second son Ma Xisheng, were born on the same day, but Ma Xisheng was born earlier on that day. (Another brother, unnamed in historical sources, was therefore likely born on the same day of a different mother, between Ma Xisheng's and Ma Xifan's births.)\nDocument[3](Title: King Nan of Zhou) King Nan of Zhou (?\u2013256 BC), born Ji Yan and less commonly known as King Yin of Zhou, was the 37th and last king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty, the son of King Shenjing of Zhou and grandson of King Xian of Zhou. He was king for fifty-nine years, the longest in the Zhou Dynasty and all of pre-imperial China (in terms of the reign length followed by King Mu of Zhou). By the time of King Nan's reign, the kings of Zhou had lost almost all political and military power, as even their remaining crown land was split into two states or factions, led by rival feudal lords: West Zhou, where the capital Wangcheng was located, and East Zhou, centred at Chengzhou and Kung. Therefore, Nan lacked any personal territory and was effectively under the control of the local feudal lords, essentially relying on their charity. However, Nan's symbolic and ritual power remains disputed. On one side, the Chinese states largely ignored the king's activities and adopted royal titles and rituals for themselves, while the dynasty's fall generally received meagre contemporary coverage and attention. This led to the assumption that Nan no longer had any symbolic power or semblance of royal authority left. On the other side, recent epigraphic discoveries and some accounts in the Records of the Grand Historian and Zhan Guo Ce suggest that until his death, Nan was still respected as the Son of Heaven. Either way, the last king of Zhou managed to preserve his weakened dynasty through diplomacy and conspiracies for fifty-nine years until his deposition by Qin and death in 256 BC.\n\nQuestion: Who is Wang Xijie's father-in-law?": [

The song was composed by Joseph\" Joe\" Brooks and served as the title song for the 1978 film\" If Ever I See You Again\", which Brooks directed and also starred in with Shelley Hack as his leading lady. Male vocalist Jamie Carr sang the theme song on the film's soundtrack. Brooks' directorial debut,\" You Light Up My Life\", had become successful largely on the strength of its title song, which as recorded by Debby Boone had spent ten weeks at# 1 on the\" Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1977. With Brooks producing, Debby Boone had subsequently recorded the\" If Ever I See You Again\" title song plus four other songs heard in the film:\" CaliforniaCome Share My LoveIt Was Such a Good Day\" and\" When It's Over\", at the Hollywood recording studio the Record Plant in January 1978, with the track\" California\" being issued as Boone's follow- up single to\" You Light Up My Life\" in February 1978 to reach# 50 on the Hot 100. Boone's version of the\" If Ever I See You Again\" title song, plus the four other songs from the film that she'd recorded, would be included on her July 1978 album release\" Midstream\". Despite Boone's success with the theme song from\" You Light Up My Life\", Brooks was hoping to place the\" If Ever I See You Again\" theme song plus other songs from the film with an established artist. According to his partner Robert K. Lifton, Brooks offered the\" If Ever I See You Again\" numbers to Arista Records president Clive Davis for Barry Manilow to record only to renege after hearing the existing tracks intended for Manilow's upcoming album, which Brooks felt were sub-par and would sink his own compositions( in fact Manilow's 1978 album release\" Even Now\" would be a triple platinum seller). Brooks then approached Atlantic Records president Jerry Greenberg with the intent of having the\" If Ever I See You Again\" theme song and other songs from the film recorded by Roberta Flack( Flack has stated that she had been offered\" You Light Up My Life\" prior to the Debby Boone recording:\" Some people whose opinions I respect very much suggested I should do it ... but the song reminded me of too many other things that I had heard or sung and I just did n't like it[ although] I think[ for] Debby Boone[' You Light Up My Life'] was perfect\". Flack would eventually describe\" If Ever I See You Again\" as\" a song I could n't stand\" that Greenberg insisted she record:\" I had a very clever lawyer who made a huge money deal for[ my recording] that song\": Flack recorded\" If Ever I See You Again\" at A&R Recording Studios in New York City in a session produced by Brooks which also yielded Flack's versions of\" Come Share My Love\" and\" When It's Over\". With a track from Flack's 1977\" Blue Lights in the Basement\" album:\" I'd Like To Be Baby To You\", as B-side,\" If Ever I See You Again\" was released as a single in 21 April 1978- a month before the film's premiere- to debut the\" Billboard\" Hot 100 dated 20 May 1978 at# 87( the same chart ranked the\" Blue Lights in the Basement\" single: the Donny Hathaway duet\" The Closer I Get to You\" at its# 2 peak for a second and final week). With the film\" If Ever I See You Again\" quickly proving a massive flop, Flack's single was left to fare on its own merit, and did in July 1978 spend three weeks at No. 1 on the Easy Listening chart with an eventual ranking as the# 8 Easy Listening hit for the year: however, while reaching the Top 40 on both the Pop-oriented Hot 100 and the R&B chart,\" If Ever I See You Again\" was not on either chart afforded the impact which had previously been customary for Flack's lead singles, the Hot 100 peak for\" If Ever I See You Again\" being# 24 with its R&B peak being# 37. On the pop- oriented singles charts published in both\" Cashbox\" and\" Record World If Ever I See You Again\" peaked at# 38, with the single's peak on the respective magazines' R&B charts being# 37 and# 58). \" If Ever I See You Again\" was included on the August 1978 album release\" Roberta Flack\"- the planned album title of\" If Ever I See You Again\" being dropped due to the single's underperformance-, that album also including the two other tracks cut with Joe Brooks at A&R Studios:\" Come Share My Love\" and\" When It's Over\", the two latter tracks being issued on a single in October 1978 with the A- side\" When It's Over\" reaching# 82 on the R&B chart. From 1979 Flack would tend to rank on the R&B chart as opposed to the Hot 100, her only solo Hot 100 entry subsequent to\" If Ever I See You Again\" being another movie theme song:\" Making Love\", which peaked at# 13 in 1982. However Flack did reach the Top 20 of the Hot 100 with two duets:\" Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" with Peabo Bryson( #16/ 1983) and\" Set the Night to Music\" with Maxi Priest( #6/ 1991).\n\nQuestion: Which country the director of film I See You (2006 Film) is from?": [

He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary \"Fragmentary Annals of Ireland\" as Gofraid, and brother of Auisle and \u00cdmar, the latter of whom founded the U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The Irish Annals title Amla\u00edb, \u00cdmar and Auisle \"kings of the foreigners\". Modern scholars use the title \"kings of Dublin\" after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. The epithet \"Conung\" is derived from the Old Norse \"konungr\" and simply means \"king\". Some scholars consider Amla\u00edb to be identical to Olaf the White, a Viking sea-king who features in the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\" and other Icelandic sagas. During the late 850s and early 860s Amla\u00edb was involved in a protracted conflict with M\u00e1el Sechnaill, overking of the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of Munster and its resources. Amla\u00edb allied successively with Cerball, King of Ossory and\n\u00c1ed Findliath, overking of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill against M\u00e1el Sechnaill. M\u00e1el Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this Amla\u00edb and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. In later years Amla\u00edb conducted extensive raids in Scotland, though these were interrupted by a war in 868 against his former ally \u00c1ed Findliath when several Viking longphorts along the northern coast were razed. Amla\u00edb disappears from contemporary annals in 871. Later accounts say he returned to Lochlann to aid his father in a war, and the \"Pictish Chronicle\" says he died in battle against Constantine I of Scotland. This event is usually dated to 874.\nDocument[2](Title: D\u00fangal mac Cellaig) D\u00fangal mac Cellaig( died 772) was a King of Osraige in modern County Kilkenny. He ruled from 770 to 772. He was of the dynasty known as the D\u00e1l Birn that ruled over Osraige in the early Christian period and was the son of Cellach mac F\u00e1elchair( died 735), a previous king. The Osraige plunged into civil war upon the death of Anmchad mac Con Cherca after 761. T\u00f3im Sn\u00e1ma mac Flainn was opposed by the sons of Cellach, presumably D\u00fangal and in 761 they were defeated by T\u00f3im Sn\u00e1ma and were put to flight.

Conchobar was the son of Donnchad Midi, high-king of Ireland (733\u2013797); his mother was Fuirseach, a noblewoman of the D\u00e1l nAraidi. Conchobar married Land, daughter of the former High-King \u00c1ed Oirdnide. They had a son named Atr\u00ed, who became a cleric at Armagh, as well as three other sons, Cathal, Eoch\u00f3can, and Cin\u00e1ed. Conchobar appears as a historical figure for the first time when, in the year 802, the high-king \u00c1ed Oirdnide mac N\u00e9ill of Cen\u00e9l n\u00c9ogain, Conchobar's brother-in-law,(father-in-law) portioned out the lordship of Clann Cholm\u00e1in between Conchobar and Ailill. Ailill was Conchobar's brother, but in the following year at Rathconnell, Conchobar killed his brother to take the whole lordship for himself. Only five years later Conchobar, allied now with the king of Connaught, campaigned for the High-Kingship. He met and defeated his former patron \u00c1ed Oirdnide, but it was not until \u00c1ed's death in 819 that Conchobar was recognized as High-King. Even then Conchobar had to deal with the opposition of \u00c1ed's cousin, Murchad mac M\u00e1ele D\u00fain. The latter was able to form an alliance with one of Conchobar's own subject kindreds, the S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine. Conchobar soon became aware of the treachery, and in 822 he took revenge on this kindred in \"an especially horrific slaughter\". In 823 Conchobar formed an alliance with Feidlimid mac Crimthainn, King of Munster (820\u2013847). However, Conchobar's attempts to subordinate Munster and its king proved intolerable to Feidlimid, and from 827 onwards Feidlimid mac Crimthainn was a source of opposition. Conchobar died in unknown circumstances in 833, to which renewed Viking raids formed the backdrop. He is buried at Clonard Abbey.\n\nQuestion: Who is Colg\u00fa Mac Fa\u00edlbe Flaind's uncle?": [

He became a star after co-starring in one of the most successful silent films of all time, \"The Big Parade\" (1925), directed by King Vidor and starring John Gilbert. After signing with MGM in 1926, he appeared in supporting roles in several popular silent films before teaming up with George K. Arthur to form the successful comedy duo Dane & Arthur. They appeared in a number of silent, short comedy films and toured the vaudeville circuit. At the peak of his career, Dane earned $1500 a week. As the film industry transitioned from silent to sound films in the late 1920s, Dane's thick Danish accent became problematic. By 1930, Dane was relegated to less prominent roles, often with little to no dialogue. Later that year, MGM terminated his contract. Dane attempted to pursue work in other fields but found no success. Broke and despondent, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in April 1934. Karl Dane's rapid career decline, depression and subsequent death have been cited as an extreme example of the fate that befell many silent film stars who were unable to make the transition from silent to sound films.\nDocument[3](Title: Lois Weber) Lois Weber( June 13, 1879 \u2013 November 13, 1939) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, producer, and director. She is identified in some historical references as\" the most important female director the American film industry has known\", and among\" the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films\". Film historian Anthony Slide has also asserted,\" Along with D.W. Griffith, Weber was the American cinema's first genuine auteur, a filmmaker involved in all aspects of production and one who utilized the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies\". Weber produced a body of work which has been compared to Griffith's in both quantity and quality and brought to the screen her concerns for humanity and social justice in an estimated 200 to 400 films, of which as few as twenty have been preserved. She has been credited by IMDb with directing 135 films, writing 114, and acting in 100. Weber was\" one of the first directors to come to the attention of the censors in Hollywood's early years\". Weber has been credited with pioneering the use of the split screen technique to show simultaneous action in her 1913 film\" Suspense\". In collaboration with her first husband, Phillips Smalley, in 1913 Weber was\" one of the first directors to experiment with sound\", making the first sound films in the United States. She was also the first American woman to direct a full- length feature film when she and Smalley directed\" The Merchant of Venice\" in 1914, and in 1917 the first American woman director to own her own film studio. During the war years, Weber\" achieved tremendous success by combining a canny commercial sense with a rare vision of cinema as a moral tool\". At her zenith,\" few men, before or since, have retained such absolute control over the films they have directedand certainly no women directors have achieved the all- embracing, powerful status once held by Lois Weber\". By 1920, Weber was considered the\" premier woman director of the screen and author and producer of the biggest money making features in the history of the film business\". Among Weber's notable films are: the controversial\" Hypocrites\", which featured the first full- frontal female nude scene, in 1915; the 1916 film\" Where Are My Children?\", which discussed abortion and birth control and was added to the National Film Registry in 1993; her adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's\" Tarzan of the Apes\" novel for the very first\" Tarzan of the Apes\" film, in 1918; and what is often considered her masterpiece,\" The Blot\", in 1921. Weber is credited with discovering, mentoring, or making stars of several women actors, including Mary MacLaren, Mildred Harris, Claire Windsor, Esther Ralston, Billie Dove, Ella Hall, Cleo Ridgely, and Anita Stewart, and with discovering and inspiring screenwriter Frances Marion. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Weber was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died first, The Boss And The Worker or Claire'S Knee?": [

He was a titular king of Kartli in 1709. In 1675, Levan was confirmed as a \"janisin\" (regent) of Kartli during the absence of his reigning brother, George XI (Gurgin Khan), at the Persian military service in Afghanistan. Summoned to Isfahan in 1677, he had to accept Islam and take the name Shah-Quli Khan. Thereafter he was appointed as naib of Kerman, Iran, and, as a commander of Georgian auxiliary forces, he secured the eastern provinces of the Persian empire from the rebellious Baluchi tribesmen from 1698 to 1701. For a short time in 1703, he was again a janisin for his absent brother in Kartli.

While \"Apocalypto\" is set during the terminal post-classic period of Maya civilization, the central pyramid of the film comes from the classic period, which ended in A.D. 900, such as those found in the Postclassic sites of Muyil, Coba, and others in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where later cities are built around earlier pyramids. The temples are in the shape of those of Tikal in the central lowlands classic style but decorated with the Puuc style elements of the northwest Yucat\u00e1n centuries later. Richard D. Hansen comments, \"There was nothing in the post-classic period that would match the size and majesty of that pyramid in the film.

Palmer. \" Other Worlds\" was launched in November 1949 by Palmer's Clark Publications and lasted for four years in its first run, with well-received stories such as \"Enchanted Village\" by A. E. van Vogt and \"Way in the Middle of the Air\", one of Ray Bradbury's \"Martian Chronicle\" stories. Since Palmer was both publisher and editor, he was free to follow his own editorial policy, and presented a wide array of science fiction. Palmer entered a partnership with a Chicago businessman in 1953 to create Bell Publications, and printed \"Universe Science Fiction\" from June 1953. Palmer used the new company to abandon \"Other Worlds\" and launch \"Science Stories\", in order to escape from Clark Publications' financial difficulties. Hence \"Science Stories\" can be considered a continuation of \"Other WorldsScience Stories\" was visually attractive but contained no memorable fiction. \"Universe\", on the other hand, was drab in appearance, but included some well-received stories, such as Theodore Sturgeon's \"The World Well Lost\", which examined homosexuality, a controversial topic for the time. Palmer's Chicago partner lost interest, so he took over both \"Science Stories\" and \"Universe Science Fiction\" under a new company. In 1955 he culled both magazines and brought back \"Other Worlds\", numbering the issues to make the new magazine appear a continuation of both the original \"Other Worlds\" and also of \"Universe\". In this new incarnation the magazine was less successful, but did print Marion Zimmer Bradley's first novel, \"Falcons of Narabedla\". In 1957 Palmer changed the focus of the magazine to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), retitling it \"Flying Saucers from Other Worlds\", and after the September 1957 issue no more fiction appeared. Palmer eventually settled on \"Flying Saucers, Mysteries of the Space Age\" as the title, and in that form it survived until June 1976.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Extreme Ops or Puberun?": [

She came from a Syrian family of citrus farmers, with two brothers and another sister, living in two small coastal villages, Omraneya and Babryon, outside the port of Latakia. She grew up in a family of Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam. At age 14, she married Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden in Latakia in 1956 and moved to Saudi Arabia with her husband. She was the eleventh wife of Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Her husband had many wives and he divorced most of them, as having only four wives at once was in accordance with Muslim law. It has been reported that she was a concubine rather than wife of Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. She was more cosmopolitan than Mohammed's first three Wahhabi Saudi wives. Osama bin Laden was her only child with Mohammad bin Laden, and they divorced soon after his birth in 1957; Osama was somewhere between the 17th and the 22nd of the 24 sons which Mohammad would sire.

Yanni continues to use the musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, \"Live at the Acropolis,\" yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's Taj Mahal, China's Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa, Russia's Kremlin, Puerto Rico's El Morro castle, Lebanon's ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia's Roman Theatre of Carthage, India's Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel. At least sixteen of Yanni's albums have peaked at No. 1 in \"Billboard'sTop New Age Album\" category, and two albums (\"Dare to Dream\" and \"In My Time\") received Grammy Award nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 Yanni had performed live in concert before more than 5 million people and had accumulated more than 40 platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling over 25 million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni's compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning British Airways television commercial. Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a \"true global artist\" and his music is said to reflect his \"one world, one people\" philosophy.\nDocument[2](Title: Chiclete com Banana) Chiclete com Banana ( Portuguese for\" chewing gum with banana\") is an Ax\u00e9 music band, currently consisting of Bell Marques, Wadinho Marques, Rey, Waltinho Cruz, Deny and Lelo.

Historian Troy Howarth states\" Originally planned as part of Universal's\" Super Jewel\" series, it was shot in 1927 and got a brief release that same year in New York City. It went into general release in 1929, just as sound films were beginning to catch on.\" He continues\" Its belated general debut led many to conclude that\" Last Performance\" was a follow- up to Paul Leni's\" The Man Who Laughs\"( 1928) ... However, Fejos' film was made first.\" The silent version went into general release at the Little Carnegie Theater in New York City in November 1929. Later release prints contained sound effects, and the Hungarian release prints featured Bela Lugosi overdubbing Conrad Veidt's voice. \" The Last Performance\" was shot on the same set as the 1925 film\" The Phantom of the Opera\", and contained an early use of zoom effects. The film received mixed reviews. Troy Howarth states\" An interesting rumor has circulated for years among film enthusiasts that Walter Brennan appears in the film as a circus clown, but this is difficult to confirm with any degree of certainty\".

At the time of independence, Mozambique lacked a national television network, so a newsreel program was the only way to reach the population through visual media. The first cultural act of President Machel \u2019s government was the establishment of the Kuxa Kanema weekly newsreel program. The newsreels were shown in Mozambique \u2019s relatively few cinemas in the 35 mm format. In the rural areas, mobile units provided by the Soviet Union offered the newsreels in the 16 mm format. Machel's government, however, did not finance or encourage the creation of a film industry designed strictly for entertainment value. The film also details the struggle to get INC up and running: Mozambique had no film industry or film schools( Brazilian and Cuban instructors were flown in to offer on- the- spot educational training). The resulting newsreels were shot in black- in- white because color film was too expensive. Machel's death in an airplane crash in 1986, coupled with guerrilla attacks launched by the apartheid governments of South Africa and Rhodesia that destabilized Mozambique to the point of civil war, helped to kill this program. Many of the cinemas in the cities were damaged in the civil war, while the rural presentations of Kuxa Kanema were cancelled due to the lack of safe passage along rural roads. By the end of the conflict, national television had been established and there was no call for a theatrical newsreel presentation. \" Kuxa Kanema: The Birth of Cinema\" offers clips of rarely seen footage from the INC films. It also looks into the offer by French filmmaker Jean- Luc Godard to create a national independent television network. \" Kuxa Kanema: The Birth of Cinema\" has played in film festivals and has been released on DVD.\nDocument[2](Title: Eusko Sozialistak) Eusko Sozialistak( ES) was a Basque socialist political party, with presence in the Spanish Basque Country.

He received his final name in honor of his uncle, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, who was killed in World War I shortly before Gonzalo's baptism. The infante was educated privately.

The original line- up consisted of George Tomsco( lead guitar), Chuck Tharp( vocals), Stan Lark( bass), Eric Budd( drums), and Dan Trammell( rhythm guitar). The Fireballs were formed in Raton, New Mexico in 1957, and got their start as an instrumental group featuring the distinctive lead guitar of George Tomsco. They recorded at Norman Petty's studio in Clovis, New Mexico. According to group founders Tomsco and Lark, they took their name from Jerry Lee Lewis's\" Great Balls of Fire\". They reached the Top 40 with the singles\" Torquay\"( 1959),\" Bulldog\"( 1960) and\" Quite a Party\"( 1961). \" Quite a Party\" peaked at# 29 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1961. Tharp, Budd and Trammell left the group in the early 1960s, but the Fireballs added Doug Roberts on drums, plus Petty Studio singer/ pianist Jimmy Gilmer( born September 15, 1940 in Chicago and raised in Amarillo, Texas) to the group. Billed as Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs, the group reached number 1 on the Billboard chart with\" Sugar Shack\", which remained at that position for five weeks in 1963. The single also reached number 1 on Billboard's R&B chart for one week in November of that year, but its run on that chart was cut short because\" Billboard\" ceased publishing an R&B chart from November 30, 1963 to January 23, 1965. Nonetheless,\" Sugar Shack\" earned the group a Gold Record Award for\" Top Song Of 1963\". In the UK the song peaked at# 45. Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs then had another pop hit in 1964 with a similar- sounding\" Daisy Petal Pickin'\", which reached number 15 on the Hot 100. Norman Petty had been Buddy Holly's main recording producer and after Holly's death obtained the rights to Holly's early rehearsal and home demo recordings. From May 1962 until August 1968, Petty had the Fireballs overdub the Holly material, making them the band he never knew he had though the band had met Holly at Petty's studio in 1957. The overdubs were originally released on four albums of\" new\" Holly material throughout the 1960s with four of the efforts released as singles charting. In 1964, they recorded and released an album( solely under Jimmy Gilmer's name) of a dozen Holly covers called\" Buddy's Buddy,\" likely inspired by the posthumous collaborations. During the run of\" Daisy Petal Pickin'\" on the charts, the British Invasion began with the first hits by the Beatles. The group had difficulty competing with the influx of British artists and did not reach the Top 40 again until 1967, with\" Bottle of Wine\", which was written by Tom Paxton. The Fireballs took\" Bottle of Wine\" to number 9 on the Hot 100. Although Gilmer was still a member of the group, the band was billed simply as\" The Fireballs\" on that single. Gilmer left the group in 1967 to pursue artist management and record production in Nashville, Tennessee. Drummer Doug Roberts died in 1981. All of the Fireballs' material has been reissued on Ace Records( UK) and Sundazed record labels. The Fireballs continued performing with original members George Tomsco, Stan Lark and Chuck Tharp until 2006, when Tharp died of cancer. Gilmer returned as lead vocalist in 2007. Lark retired from the group in 2016.

The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's\" Be Here Now\", although its chart stay was brief. \" Do n't Believe the Truth\" went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006( 900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies. This album continued the tradition from their previous album with every member of the band contributing to the writing of tracks for the album, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. \" Do n't Believe the Truth\" is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey who, while not an official member of Oasis, performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White. The album received positive reviews from critics and many cited it as Oasis's best album in a decade. Liam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album by his developing songwriting. Noel has said that this album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members have contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel- written Oasis album. The band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Do n't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2 million people at a total of 113 concerts. This resulted in the making of\" Lord Do n't Slow Me Down\", a film later released on DVD.

He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood's Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent. Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio.

The film's sets were designed by the art directors Fritz Maurischat and Karl Weber. It was produced by a subsidiary of Tobis Film. Location shooting took place around Potsdam, including at the Garrison Church. Interiors were shot at the Grunewald and Johannisthal Studios. It premiered at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo. Part of the tradition of Prussian films of the Weimar and Nazi eras, the film ostensibly deals with the intense conflict between Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I and his son and heir, Crown Prince Friedrich \u2013 the future King Friedrich II\" The Great\". This is a well- known incident of 18th century German history, which had drawn much public attention in the time itself, and been artistically treated before. However, in its specific presentation of this historical theme, the film was clearly seen to be a work of Nazi propaganda aimed at extolling the\" F\u00fchrerprinzip\", i.e. blind obedience to the Leader( the King in the film's plot, Hitler in the reality for which the film was a parable); complaints of\" encirclement\" and the need for\" Lebensraum\" also feature. For that reason, the film was banned by the Allied military government following the Nazi defeat in 1945. However, after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany the FSK(\" Voluntary Self Regulation of the Movie Industry\") subjected it to a test on 4 August 1958 and ruled that, unlike other films made under the Nazis, the propaganda element in it was not so blatant as to justify its inclusion in the list of\" Forbidden Films\".\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born later, Song Of The Open Road or Campaign Of Hate: Russia And Gay Propaganda?": [

However, Salvidienus was defeated in a naval battle fought off Rhegium, largely because of the inexperience of his crews. On Octavian's return from Greece after the Battle of Philippi, Salvidienus was sent to Spain with six legions, but he hastily retreated to Italy to oppose Lucius Antonius and Fulvia( Antony's wife), who had taken up arms against Octavian, starting the so- called Perusian War. Salvidienus captured and destroyed the city of Sentinum and then, with Agrippa, surrounded Lucius Antonius's forces in Perusia. The other Antonian generals, who had no clear orders from Antony, remained out of the struggle, and Lucius Antonius was forced to surrender after a few months' siege( winter of 40 BC). After the end of the Perusian War, Octavian sent Salvidienus to Gaul as a governor, with a large army of eleven legions. He was also designated as consul for 39 BC, although he had not reached senatorial rank. Despite all these honours, when Antony came from the East with large forces to confront Octavian, Salvidienus offered to desert to Antony with his legions. Apparently this proposal came after Antony had already made an agreement with Octavian( the Pact of Brundisium). Antony revealed to Octavian the treachery of Salvidienus, who was accused of high treason in the Senate and condemned to death in the fall of 40 BC. He was either executed or committed suicide, as reported by Appian, Livy, and Dio.\n\nQuestion: Who is Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Executed 39)'s father-in-law?": [

He was the son of Rhode Island governor Richard Ward, was well-educated, and grew up in a large Newport, Rhode Island family. After marrying, he and his wife received property in Westerly, Rhode Island from his father-in-law, and the couple settled there and took up farming. He entered politics as a young man and soon took sides in the hard-money vs. paper-money controversy, favoring hard money or specie. His primary rival over the money issue was Providence politician Stephen Hopkins, and the two men became bitter rivals\u2014and the two also alternated as governors of the Colony for several terms. During this time of political activity, Ward became a founder and trustee of Brown University. The most contentious issue that he faced during his three years as governor involved the Stamp Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament just before he took office for the second time. The Stamp Act placed a tax on all official documents and newspapers, infuriating the American colonists by being done without their consent. Representatives of the colonies met to discuss the act but, when it came time for the colonial governors to take a position, Ward was the only one who stood firm against it, threatening his position but bringing him recognition as a great patriot. Ward's final term as governor ended in 1767, after which he retired to work on his farm in Westerly. However, he was called back into service in 1774 as a delegate to the Continental Congress. War was looming with England, and to this end he devoted all of his energy. After hostilities began, Ward stated, \"'Heaven save my country,' is my first, my last, and almost my only prayer.\" He died of smallpox during a meeting of the Congress in Philadelphia, three months before the signing of the American Declaration of Independence, and was buried in a local cemetery. His remains were later re-interred in the Common Burying Ground in Newport.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Kunigunde Of Poland's father?": [

A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish ethnicity, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa. He was originally sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1164 alongside his uncle Shirkuh, a general of the Zengid army, on the orders of their lord Nur ad-Din to help restore Shawar as vizier of the teenage Fatimid caliph . A power struggle ensued between Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated. Saladin, meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his military successes against Crusader assaults against its territory and his personal closeness to al-Adid. After Shawar was assassinated and Shirkuh died in 1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin vizier, a rare nomination of a Sunni Muslim to such an important position in the Isma'ili Shia caliphate. During his tenure as vizier, Saladin began to undermine the Fatimid establishment and, following al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the and realigned the country's allegiance with the Sunni, Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate. In the following years, he led forays against the Crusaders in Palestine, commissioned the successful conquest of Yemen, and staved off pro-Fatimid rebellions in Upper Egypt. Not long after Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, Saladin launched his conquest of Syria, peacefully entering Damascus at the request of its governor. By mid-1175, Saladin had conquered Hama and Homs, inviting the animosity of other Zengid lords, the official rulers of Syria's various regions. Soon after, he defeated the Zengid army at the Battle of the Horns of Hama and was thereafter proclaimed the \"Sultan of Egypt and Syria\" by the Abbasid caliph al-Mustadi. Saladin made further conquests in northern Syria and Jazira, escaping two attempts on his life by the \"Assassins\", before returning to Egypt in 1177 to address issues there. By 1182, Saladin had completed the conquest of Muslim Syria after capturing Aleppo, but ultimately failed to take over the Zengid stronghold of Mosul. Under Saladin's command, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, and thereafter wrested control of Palestine\u2014including the city of Jerusalem\u2014from the Crusaders, who had conquered the area 88 years earlier. Although the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem continued to exist until the late 13th century, its defeat at Hattin marked a turning point in its conflict with the Muslim powers of the region. Saladin died in Damascus in 1193, having given away much of his personal wealth to his subjects. He is buried in a mausoleum adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque. Saladin has become a prominent figure in Muslim, Arab, Turkish and Kurdish culture, and he has often been described as being the most famous Kurd in history.\nDocument[3](Title: Nev\u015fehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha) Nev\u015fehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha (1666 \u2013 October 16, 1730) served as Grand Vizier for Sultan Ahmed III of the Ottoman Empire during the Tulip period.

Born in the North Caucasus region of Circassia or in Abkhazia he was kidnapped and sold to the Mamluk Emir Ali Bey al- Kabir in Egypt. He became Ali Bey's closest and favourite fellow, his most trusted general and even his brother- in- law( according to other sources: son -in- law or adoptive son). During the Russo-Turkish War Ali Bey declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire and allegedly attempted to restore the former Mamluk Sultanate which was conquered by the Ottoman Turks 250 years before. On behalf of Ali Bey, Abu Dhahab suppressed a revolt in Upper Egypt( 1769), seized the Hejaz( 1770) and- allied with the Palestinian emir Zahir al- Umar- conquered large parts of Ottoman Syria( 1771). Having taken Damascus( 1772) from its Ottoman governor Uthman Pasha al- Kurji, Abu Dhahab changed sides, handed over all the conquered territories to the Ottomans and marched against Cairo. Ali Bey fled to Zahir al- Umar in Acre, and Abu Dhahab became the new Shaykh al- Balad( civil governor) and de facto ruler of Egypt. When Ali Bey came back and tried to restore his position, he was defeated and killed by Abu Dhahab's forces near Cairo( 1773).

Due to Petula Clark having reached #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in January 1965 with \"Downtown\" and being afforded a smash follow-up with \"I Know a Place\", Connie Francis was eager to work with Clark's main composer and producer Tony Hatch. They met on 26 May 1965 at Philips Studios Stanhope Place in London for a three-song session which yielded a cover version of Connie Smith's 1964 C&W classic \"Once a Day\", the ballad \"Roundabout\" (previously recorded by Petula Clark but then unreleased) and the beat number \"Love Is Me, Love Is You\". The session notes indicate two versions of \"Love Is Me , Love Is You\", referred to as \"US version\" and \"UK version\". Both versions share a very similar orchestral arrangement with only slight differences, but make distinct use of the background vocalists on the song's refrain, the US version featuring the background vocalists singing \"doo-wop\" behind Francis' vocal while on the UK version the background vocalists sing-along with Francis. \"Love Is Me, Love Is You\" had its original single release serving as B-side to \"Roundabout\" in that track's UK single release of 3 September 1965. In the US \u2013 where \"Roundabout\" had been released with the B-side \"Bossa Nova Hand DanceLove Is Me , Love Is You\" was given an A-side single release in February 1966 to rise to a \"Billboard\" Hot 100 peak of #66.

In Canada, Francis' \"Love Is Me, Love Is You\" would chart with a #61 peak: in Australia the track would afford Francis her final major hit in that territory with a #31 peak. The Connie Francis single release with \"Love Is Me, Love Is You\" as A-side featured as B-side the track \"I'd Let You Break My Heart All Over Again\" which Francis had recorded 10 July 1959.

The historian Geoffrey Keating states that during the twelve-year period that Mathgamain held the sovereignty of Munster, \"Echthighearn, son of Cinneide, was chief of Thomond. \" Donnchuan mac Cenniedi and his brother Echthigern were slain in the year 950 when Congalach Cnogba, King of Ireland, invaded the province of Munster. Echthigern was the progenitor of Irish families Anglicized Ahearn, Ahern and O'Hearn with other spelling variations, in addition to Mac Craith (McGrath, etc.), Mac Gonigle (Gunnell), and O'Quirk.\nDocument[2](Title: Conaing Bececlach) Conaing Begeclach was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, joint High King of Ireland with his brother or half- brother Eochu F\u00edadmuine. They took power after killing the previous High King, Eochu Uairches. Conaing ruled the northern half of Ireland, Eochu the south. Their parentage is unclear. The\" Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn\" reports two possibilities: that he and Eochu were the sons of Congal, son of Lugaid Cal of the Corcu Laigde of County Cork; or that Eochu was the son of Congal, and Conaing was the son of Dui Temrach, son of Muiredach Bolgrach, but both had the same mother, who was also the mother of Eochu Uairches. Geoffrey Keating makes them both sons of Dui Temrach, and the Four Masters make them the sons of Dui's son Congal Coscarach. After five years of joint rule, Eochu was killed by Eochu Uairches' son Lugaid L\u00e1mderg. According to the\" Lebor Gab\u00e1la\", Conaing remained in power in the north, while Lugaid took the south. The\" Annals of the Four Masters\" say Lugaid ousted Conaing and took complete control of Ireland. Seven years later, Conaing killed Lugaid and became sole ruler for a further ten( or twenty) years, after which he was killed by Lugaid's son Art. The\" Lebor Gab\u00e1la\" synchronises Conaing's career with the reigns of Artaxerxes I( 465 \u2013 424 BC) and Darius II( 423\u2013404) of Persia. The chronology of Keating's\" Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn\" dates his career to 621\u2013599 BC, that of the\" Annals of the Four Masters\" to 844\u2013812 BC. However, in the saga\" Do suidigud tellaich Temrathe settling of the manor of Tara\"), the crucifixion of Christ takes place during his reign.\nDocument[3](Title: Bran Becc mac Murchado) Bran Becc mac Murchado (died 738) was a King of Leinster from the U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge branch of the Laigin. He was the son of Murchad mac Brain Mut (died 727), a previous king. He ruled briefly in 738. The \"Annals of Tigernach\" claim that in 738 Cathal mac Finguine (died 742), king of Munster led a hosting into Leinster and took hostages and treasure from Bran. However, the \"Annals of Ulster\" claim that it was his brother F\u00e1el\u00e1n mac Murchado (died 738) who gave the hostages which is more likely. Bran Becc is referred to as king in the king lists of the \"Book of Leinster\" which ignore \u00c1ed mac Colggen (died 738) of the U\u00ed Cheinnselaig who was more likely king at this time. Bran and \u00c1ed, along with many other kings, were killed in battle against the high king \u00c1ed All\u00e1n mac Fergaile of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain at the Battle of \u00c1th Senaig (Ballyshannon, Co.Kildare) in 738. This fight known as the battle of the groans is described at length in the Irish annals. The Annals of Ulster say: And men say that so many fell in this great battle that we find no comparable slaughter in a single onslaught and fierce conflict throughout all preceding ages.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of Eochaid Ailtlethan?": [

He appears in only one much later( probably 14th century) document that is considered unreliable, so his existence is doubted. The list of the counts of Loon is normally started with Giselbert. Since Leon Vanderkindere's seminal publications at the beginning of the twentieth century, scholars have tended to ignore the medieval report of Otto and accept Vanderkindere's proposal that Giselbert's father was Rudolf, the son of Count Nevelung. More recently, proposals have been made that Otto might have existed and been a son or nephew of Rudolf. None of these proposals have led to any consensus and can only be taken as speculative proposals. Jan Baerten, who is still seen as an authority for this subject, doubted the existence of Otto at all. The only record of Otto, the third continuation of the chronicle or\" Gesta\" of the abbey of St Truiden tells of the installation of Baldrick II as Prince- Bishop of Liege, and that he was the brother of Count Giselbert of Loon, and the son of Count Otto of Loon and Liutgard of Namur. It says Liutgarde's mother Ermengarde was a countess of Namur, without naming how she became countess( presumably by marrying one of the Counts of Namur), and a daughter of a Duke Otto. It also claims she was an ancestor to Godfrey of Bouillion. Criticism of this source, written long after the facts, centres around the more detailed information it gives about Liutgard. In summary, with great uncertainty, the\" Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia\" tells us that Otto married Lutgarde, who was from Namur, and had two sons. Their brother Arnulf is known from other records:\n\nQuestion: What is the date of birth of Francis Otto, Duke Of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg's father?": [

The film is based on the 1957 novel \"Company of Cowards\" by Jack Schaefer, whose inspiration was an article by William Chamberlain, published in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" in 1956. Chamberlain recounts the apocryphal Civil War stories of \"Company Q\" (19th century army slang for the sick list), a unit composed of coward soldiers who were given a second chance to prove their bravery. The film had the novel title in pre-production and when released in the United Kingdom.

His throne name, Neferkare (\"Nefer-ka-Re\"), means \"Beautiful is the Ka of Re\". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks\u2014the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II\u2014were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: \"King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II\". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\nDocument[2](Title: Shoshenq D) Shoshenq was a High Priest of Ptah during the 22nd Dynasty.

Murphy was born on July 10, 1897 in Winchester, Massachusetts, to the artists Caroline Hutchinson (Bowles) Murphy (1868-1923) and Hermann Dudley Murphy (1867-1945, and whom his son was named for), both accomplished Modernist landscape painters. After first finding work as a journalist, Dudley Murphy began making films in the early 1920s. In his first short film, \"Soul of the Cypress\" (1921), a variation on the Orpheus myth, the film's protagonist falls in love with a dryad (a wood nymph whose soul dwells in an ancient tree) and throws himself into the sea to become immortal and spend eternity with her. Murphy's then-wife Chase Harringdine played the dryad. Murphy followed this with \"Danse Macabre\" (1922) featuring Adolph Bolm, Olin Howland, and Ruth Page. Both of these early films are in the DVD collection  issued in October 2005 (see link below). Murphy's eighth film, \"Ballet m\u00e9canique\", which he co-directed with the French artist Fernand L\u00e9ger, premiered on 24 September 1924 at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik (International Exposition for New Theater Technique) in Vienna. Considered one of the masterpieces of early experimental filmmaking, \"Ballet m\u00e9canique\" also included creative input from Man Ray and Ezra Pound, and was presented at the exposition by Frederick Kiesler. The film was scheduled to be screened with George Antheil's masterpiece of the same name. However, the music ran close to 30 minutes, while the film was 17 minutes long. In 2000, Paul Lehrman produced a married print of the film. In her book \"Dudley Murphy: Hollywood Wild Card\", film historian Susan Delson argues persuasively that Murphy was the film's driving force but that L\u00e9ger was more successful at promoting the film as his own creation. \" Ballet m\u00e9canique\", with the George Antheil music originally written for the film, was included in the DVD collection  released in October 2005. In addition to \"Ballet m\u00e9canique\", Murphy is best remembered for \"St. Louis Blues\" (1929) with Bessie Smith and Jimmy Mordecai, \"Black and Tan\" (1929) with Duke Ellington and His Orchestra, \"Confessions of a Co-Ed\" (1931), \"The Sport Parade\" (1932) with Joel McCrea, and \"The Emperor Jones\" (1933), starring Paul Robeson. In 1932, Murphy helped introduce the Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros to prominent people in the Los Angeles community. To show his gratitude, Siqueiros painted a mural on a wall in Murphy's Pacific Palisades home. The only intact mural by Siqueiros in the United States, \"Portrait of Mexico Today\" was donated anonymously to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in 1999. From the late 1940s through the 1960s Murphy and his fourth wife, Virginia, owned and operated Holiday House, an exclusive Malibu hotel designed by Richard Neutra and favored by the Hollywood elite.\nDocument[3](Title: Atlantics) Atlantics is a 2019 internationally co-produced supernatural romantic drama film directed by Mati Diop, in her feature directorial debut.

He grew up in a liberal milieu, but he later came closer to more leftist views. He studied at the University of Vienna and became a literary critic and a neo-romantic poet. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Albreht was editor of the liberal literary magazine \"Ljubljanski zvon\". After the crisis of the journal in 1932, which emerged from different interpretations of Slovene identity and attitudes towards the centralist policies in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Albreht left the journal and established, together with the literary critic Josip Vidmar and author Ferdo Kozak, a new magazine called \"SodobnostModernity\"). Under Albreht, Vidmar and Kozak, the new magazine became the foremost progressive journal in Slovenia, in which also many Marxists and Communists could publish their articles under pseudonyms. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Albreht became an active member of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People in Ljubljana. He was imprisoned by Italian fascist authorities on a number of occasions. In 1944, the Nazis sent him to Dachau concentration camp. Soon after the liberation from Nazi occupation and the establishment of the Communist regime in Yugoslavia in 1945, he was appointed mayor of Ljubljana.

He graduated history in Sofia University in 1976 and specialized Thracology in Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Now Professor Ovcharov teaches history in New Bulgarian University and Slavic University in Moscow. He has published 18 books and more than 250 articles. Nikolay Ovcharov discovered a unique ancient Thracian city of Perperikon in the Eastern Rhodopes. It is thought that the famous sanctuary and oracular shrine dedicated to Dionysus of the Bessi was situated there. Later he discovered an ancient Thracian surface tomb in Tatul which was soon recognized as an exclusive religious centre. According to Ovcharov, the site is the sanctuary and tomb of an influential Thracian leader who was deified after his death. He links it with the cult of Orpheus. In 2005, German scholars from the University of Heidelberg confirmed that the two rather small fragments discovered by Ovcharov in the Eastern Rhodopes mountains are written in the Minoan Linear A script from about 15th century BC. In August 2006, Ovcharov claimed that a stone tile dating allegedly to 5,000 BC contains some unknown writing.

R. Subba Rao's three novels\" NagarahavuOndu Gandu Eradu Hennu\" and\" Sarpa Mathsara\", and starring Vishnuvardhan, Aarathi, K. S. Ashwath and Shubha in lead roles. The supporting cast features Leelavathi, Ambareesh, Shivaram, Dheerendra Gopal, Lokanath and Vajramuni. This is the first Kannada movie to complete 100 days in three centres. This film was remade in Hindi as\" Zehreela Insaan\", directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself and in Tamil as\" Raja Nagam\" and\" Kode Nagu\" in Telugu. The film was a huge success and paved way for the stardom of Vishnuvardhan and Ambarish who eventually morphed as leading actors in Kannada cinema. This was Vishnuvardhan's first movie as the lead. Over a period of time, the character roles of Leelavathi, Dheerendra Gopal, Loknath, M. N. Lakshmi Devi have come in for their share of applause. The film primarily revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his teacher, Chamayya( K. S. Ashwath). Chamayya, who is childless treats Ramachari( Vishnuvardhan) as his son. He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger. He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour. Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness. He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride. Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything. His love interests are Alamelu( Aarathi) and Margaret( Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life. The conversations between the Guru( Chamayya) and Shishya( Ramachari) is the highlight of movie all through. Chamayya and Ramachari have differences of opinion over what is right and wrong. Chamayya is more willing to blend in with the society than Ramachari and this usually ends in an argument between the two. It is possible that the society is the silent rhetoric for the title of the movie which spreads venom \u2014 a cobra. The movie was remade in Hindi as\" Zehreela Insaan\", in Tamil as\" Raja Nagam\" and in Telugu as\" Kode Nagu\". The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018.

Although she does not quote particular melodies, her compositional style is accessible and influenced by American folk and popular idioms; her success at creating a distinctly American musical voice places her among such figures as Charles Ives, Aaron Copland and George Gershwin. Peggy Stuart was born in Swampscott, Massachusetts. She started piano lessons at age five, wrote her first song at age nine, and later studied with Heinrich Gebhard( a pupil of Teodor Leszetycki and teacher of Leonard Bernstein), privately with Raymond Robinson, and at the New England Conservatory with Quincy Porter. She originally planned to be a concert pianist, and her early mature works are all for piano. In 1937, she wrote a ballet\" Cracked Ice\", for the Boston Skating Club. This was the first ballet ever composed specifically for ice skating. The work was scored, at her request, by Ferde Grof\u00e9, who conducted it at Madison Square Garden; it was also played by the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler. Stuart then studied orchestration. Her orchestral scores\" Night Froth The Island\"( sinfonietta),\" Smoke Drift\" and\" Twilight City\"( piano and orchestra) were all premiered by the Boston Pops. During World War II, she was involved in a housing bureau for servicemen stationed in Boston, and often played for hospitalised soldiers. She conducted an all- woman ensemble, and was pianist and assistant conductor of the Women's Symphony of Boston. She founded the Junior League Orchestra in Boston and conducted it for seven years. After the war she moved to New York City, and started a research project in music psychotherapy at a mental institution. In 1952 she married Joseph R. Coolidge, a freelance writer from Boston. Together they wrote a number of children's stories with Peggy's background music, and other songs in traditional folk style. She wrote her only film score for\" The Silken Affair\", starring David Niven, in 1956. She wrote incidental music for a New York production of Se\u00e1n O'Casey's\" Red Roses for Me\", and the music was later reworked as the orchestral suite\" Dublin Town\". In 1963 and 1965, she was invited to Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow for performances of her works, also sometimes appearing as piano soloist. She and Joseph met Aram Khachaturian and his wife Nina Makarova, becoming close friends. A ballet\" An Evening in New York\" was written on her return to the United States. \" Rhapsody for Harp and Orchestra\" was written in 1965. In 1967 her works were played in Tokyo in a concert of American music, and she was received by Emperor Hirohito's brother, Prince Mikasa. In 1969 Peggy Stuart Coolidge wrote\" Spirituals in Sunshine and Shadow\", an orchestral work inspired by African- American blues and spirituals. In 1970 she wrote\" Pioneer Dances\", inspired by the 19th century settlers of America. This was the only American work played at a 1975 Carnegie Hall concert to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Norwegian immigration to the United States. In 1970 also, at Khachaturian's instigation, she became the first American composer to have a concert devoted entirely to her works presented in the Soviet Union. She was awarded the medal of the Soviet Union of Workers in Art on this occasion. Her name started to become better known, and she was featured in concerts in Western Europe and East Berlin. In 1971, at the request of the World Wildlife Fund, she composed a three- minute theme to complement the fund's visual symbol of a giant panda on a green field. The theme became the basis for a ten-minute orchestral work with narration written by her husband, called\" Blue Planet\". That year also saw\" New England Autumn\", a two- movement suite for chamber orchestra. In 1975, the Westphalian Symphony Orchestra conducted by Siegfried Landau recorded one of the first LPs ever devoted to the works of a single American female composer. The works were the\" Rhapsody for Harp and Orchestra\"( with soloist Aristid von W\u00fcrtzler),\" New England AutumnPioneer Dances\", and\" Spirituals in Sunshine and Shadow\". She later wrote a song cycle to words by American poets, to honour the art patron Isabella Stewart Gardner, her husband's great- aunt. \" American Mosaic\" was written in 1978 on a commission by the American Wind Symphony. Peggy Stuart Coolidge died of cancer in Cushing, Maine. Her musical scores are held at the Harvard University Library. Many of her premieres took place in Europe, and she is better known overseas than she is in her own country.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Claire Annabel Caroline Grant Duff's father?": [

In addition to the title, \"Bed and Sofa\" it was also released outside of the Soviet Union under the alternate titles of \"Three in a CellarOld Dovecots\", and \"Cellars of Moscow\". The film gets its Russian title from the street on which the main characters live, Third Meshchanskaia Street. Directed by Abram Room and written by Room and Viktor Shklovsky, the film starred Nikolai Batalov as the husband, Kolia, Lyudmila Semyonova as the wife, Liuda, and Vladimir Fogel as the friend, Volodia. Billed as a satire and comedy, \"Bed and Sofa\" nonetheless portrayed the realities of the Moscow working poor, while also dealing with starkly sexual situations, such as polygamy and abortion. It was originally banned in both the United States and Europe due to those stark sexual situations. The screenplay was supposedly based on the true love story of the acclaimed Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky who lived with his \"muse\" Lilya Brik and her husband Osip Brik for some years. The characters themselves also resembled the trio, with Vladimir Fogel as Mayakovsky, Lyudmila Semyonova as Lilya and Nikolai Batalov as Osip Brik. The parallels were so obvious that some critics and associates accused Viktor Shklovsky of indelicacy and gossiping. Shklovsky himself never openly admitted it, yet in his diaries he mentions that during the work on the screenplay they \u00abwere living next to Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik\u00bb, which is an obvious hint. While movies made in the USSR would soon be regulated to the ideals of Soviet realism, some films at this time were able to present starker themes. Even so, \"Bed and Sofa\" was controversial at the time of release in the Soviet Union, due to its focus on human relationships, while the state and the party are almost completely disregarded. In fact, at one point Kolya even declines to go to a Party meeting. In addition, the film's resolution is ambiguous and comes about without any input from the collective. However, it is now considered a landmark film because of humor, naturalism, and its sympathetic portrayal of the woman.\nDocument[2](Title: Leopoldo Torre Nilsson) Leopoldo Torre Nilsson( 5 May 1924 \u2013 8 September 1978), also known as Leo Towers and as Babsy, was an Argentine film director, producer and screenwriter.

She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, where she was a student of Ferdinand Alqui\u00e9, and the University of Helsinki, where she was a student of Ingmar P\u00f6rn and Georg Henrik von Wright.

In her critically received book on Descartes (2003), Alanen goes beyond mere history, drawing out the historical antecedents and the intellectual evolution of Descartes' thinking about the mind, showing how his emphasis on the embodiment of the mind has implications far more complex and interesting than the usual dualist account associated with his thinking suggests.

He was considered one of Napoleon's more formidable opponents. He began his career fighting the revolutionary armies of France. Early in the wars of the First Coalition, he saw victory at Neerwinden in 1793, before being defeated at Wattignies 1793 and Fleurus 1794. In 1796, as chief of all Austrian forces on the Rhine, Charles defeated Jean-Baptiste Jourdan at Amberg and W\u00fcrzburg, and then won a victory at Emmendingen that forced Jean Victor Marie Moreau to withdraw across the Rhine. He also defeated opponents at Z\u00fcrich, Ostrach, Stockach, and Messkirch in 1799. He reformed Austria's armies to adopt the nation-at-arms principle. In 1809, he entered the War of the Fifth Coalition and inflicted Napoleon's first major setback at Aspern-Essling, before suffering a defeat at the bloody Battle of Wagram. After Wagram, Charles saw no more significant action in the Napoleonic Wars. As a military strategist, Charles was able to successfully execute complex and risky maneuvers of troops. However, his contemporary Carl von Clausewitz criticized his rigidity and adherence to \"geographic\" strategy.

Herrera Luque studied in the Central University of Venezuela( UCV) and later at the University of Salamanca( 1952), where he obtained his title of physician.

His PhD thesis served as basis for his book:\" Los Viajeros de Indias\"( 1961), about the psychopathic loads left on the Venezuelan population by the Spanish conquistadors. His interest in understanding the origins of the personalities of Latin America people took him to the study of heritage and genetics. Herrera Luque founded the department of psychiatry of the UCV, becoming full professor. He was appointed ambassador of Venezuela in Mexico in the mid-1970s. As writer and novelist, his historical work is based on accurate and documented research.

Born in a Eelam Tamil family, he developed a passion for photography and literature at a young age. After witnessing the shoot of David Lean's \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) during a school trip in Sri Lanka, he was drawn towards filmmaking. He graduated from the London University and started his career as a draughtsman with the Sri Lankan Government. In 1966, he moved to India and gained admission to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to pursue a course in motion picture photography. Upon completion of his diploma, he entered Malayalam cinema as a cinematographer in the early 1970s. After working in over 20 films as a cinematographer, Mahendra made his directorial debut in 1977 with the Kannada film \"Kokila\". Since then, he directed over 20 films in a span of 36 years. Along with P. Bharathiraja and J. Mahendran, he is regarded as a trendsetter in Tamil cinema.

Nicknamed \"The Greatest,\" he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time. Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and turned professional later that year. He converted to Islam and became a Muslim after 1961, and eventually took the name Muhammad Ali. He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset at age 22 in 1964. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. He was arrested, found guilty of draft evasion, and stripped of his boxing titles. He appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which overturned his conviction in 1971, but he had not fought for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. His actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation, and he was a high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI). He later disavowed the NOI, adhering to Sunni Islam, and supporting racial integration like his former mentor Malcolm X. Ali was a leading heavyweight boxer of the 20th century, and he remains the only three-time lineal champion of that division. His joint records of beating 21 boxers for the world heavyweight title and winning 14 unified title bouts stood for 35 years. Ali is the only boxer to be named \"The Ring\" magazine Fighter of the Year six times. He has been ranked the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, and as the greatest athlete of the 20th century by \"Sports Illustrated\", the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC, and the third greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN \"SportsCentury\". He was involved in several historic boxing matches and feuds, most notably his fights with Joe Frazier, such as the Thrilla in Manila, and his fight with George Foreman known as The Rumble in the Jungle which has been called \"arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century\" and was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many fighters let their managers do the talking, and he was often provocative and outlandish. He was known for trash-talking, and often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, anticipating elements of hip hop. Outside the ring, Ali attained success as a musician, where he received two Grammy nominations. He also featured as an actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion and charity. In 1984, he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, which some reports attribute to boxing-related injuries, though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally, but in his later years made increasingly limited public appearances as his condition worsened, and he was cared for by his family. Ali died on June 3, 2016.\nDocument[3](Title: Ling Zifeng) Ling Zifeng (Beijing, 10 March 1917 - 3 March 1999) was a Chinese film director.

Reilly was given the assignment by the Kennedy administration to attend the speech delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr. on August 28, 1963, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as part of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Roger Mudd reported that Reilly told him that he was positioned on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a switch that would be used to cut off Dr. King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech \"if the rhetoric got too inflammatory\". A turntable with a 78-rpm recording of Mahalia Jackson's \"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\" was on standby, having been selected in advance by Reilly.

When Benson played Cleopatra in 1898, reviewers were astonished by her \"terrible rage\", one commenting that she treated a struck-down messenger so violently that only the intervention of Charmian had saved his life. One critic later claimed that \"Benson and his companies never shook off the aura of amateurism\", and that some of the parts Constance Benson had played \"owed more to her husband's loyalty than to her talent\". As an actress, Constance Benson worked in the theatre, but in 1911 she also appeared in leading roles in four silent films, all adaptations of William Shakespeare plays: \"Richard IIIJulius CaesarMacbeth\", and \"The Taming of the Shrew\".

We have known him from a colophon in the Serbian recension of the Slavonic Josephus,\" The History of the Jewish War\". He transcribed and translated the Slavonic Josephus into Serbian vernacular at Karyes, the administrative center of Mount Athos, in 1585. In addition, the Hilandar Monastery has preserved five petitions that hieromonk Grigorije in his frequent travels throughout Europe delivered to nobleman Nikita Romanov( the grandfather of the future tsar Michael of Russia) in April 1586; Andrej Jakovlevi\u0107( two petitions written before 1582); Polish king Stephen Bathory; and Duke Andrey Kurbsky. Also, these documents have been published by the Moscow Main Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. According to records Grigorije Vasilije served as abbot of Hilandar in 1583, and multiple other occasions between 1588 and 1591 and continually from 1591 to 1598. He also traveled between the far- flung Athonite methos( including Imperial Russia) and their parent establishments on regular errands as alms collecting, property administration and Diplomatic missions on behalf of the secular and spiritual leaders where he stayed at the Moscow courts of Ivan the Terrible and Dionysius, Metropolitan of Moscow and their successors Fedor I of Russia and Patriarch Job of Moscow, years later. Upon his return voyage, Grogorije Vasilije traveled to Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in Ottoman- occupied Serbia to see his master Gerasim I and later the patriarch's successor Savatije I before resuming his trip back to Karyes, Mount Athos. Ivan the Terrible's generosity shown to Serbian itinerant monk Grigorije and other Athonite monks accompanying him could be explained by the tsar \u2019s own recognition of his Serbian royal lineage( through his mother) and the desire to strengthen relations between Russia and Serbia. Author Sreten Petkovi\u0107 in\" The Cultural Heritage of Serbia\" attributes the presence of the 1564 fresco of Prince Lazar of Serbia in the Cathedral of the Archangel of the Moscow Kremlin to Tsar Ivan \u2019s attachment to his Serbian roots.

He was the son of Sir Christopher Willoughby (died c. 1498) and Margaret or Marjery Jenney (daughter of Sir William Jenney of Knodishall, Suffolk, Justice of the King's Bench). In 1499, he succeeded as Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He married first Mary Hussey (born 1484), youngest child of Sir William Hussey, Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench. Secondly, on 5 June 1516, he married Mar\u00eda de Salinas, the Spanish-born lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon. Grimsthorpe Castle was granted by Henry VIII to the de Eresby family on the occasion of Maria's marriage. By his second wife, Willoughby had a daughter, Catherine, who succeeded him in the barony on his death in 1526. She was betrothed to Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln, the son of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Princess Mary, the sister of Henry VIII. When Princess Mary died in 1533, fourteen-year-old Catherine was hastily married to the Duke of Suffolk, her fiance's father, who was twenty-five years her senior.

Eleanor was styled as a \"kinswoman\" of Edward II on two separate occasions; once in 1318 and again in 1322 presumably by her descent from Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy who was the brother of Edward II's great-grandmother, Beatrice of Savoy. Eleanor's brothers, Edmund and John were also styled as \"kinsmen\" of the king.

He was the second son of William Randal McDonnell, 6th Earl of Antrim and Louisa McDonnell, Countess of Antrim. Following education at Eton College, he briefly entered business as a merchant banker with Morgan Grenfell. He subsequently moved to the United States of America, where he worked for Chiswell Langhorne constructing railways in Virginia. McDonnell became a close friend of Langhorne's daughter Nancy Astor. With the outbreak of the First World War, he served with the railway troops reserve of the 1st Canadian Division, constructing railways behind the lines of the Western Front, rising to the rank of colonel. He returned to the United Kingdom, where he was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the constituency of Dartford at the 1924 general election. He won the seat, narrowly defeating the sitting Labour Party member of parliament, John Edmund Mills. McDonnell had little interest in parliament, and did not defend the seat in 1929, returning to his business activities. When America entered the Second World War in 1941, McDonnell was appointed Honorary Attach\u00e9 to Washington where he was able to use his personal and business contacts to assist Lord Halifax, British Ambassador to the United States. He married Ethelwyn Sylvia Arthur Jones, the daughter of Henry Arthur Jones, on 13 December 1913. They had no issue, and she died in 1948. He died at 84 at his home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in April 1966.\nDocument[2](Title: Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r \u00d3l\u00e1fsson) Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r \u00d3l\u00e1fsson (died 10 November 1187) was a twelfth-century ruler of the kingdoms of Dublin and the Isles. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r was a son of \u00d3l\u00e1fr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, King of the Isles and Affraic, daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. Throughout his career, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r battled rival claimants to the throne, permanently losing about half of his realm to a rival dynasty in the process. Although dethroned for nearly a decade, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r clawed his way back to regain control of a partitioned kingdom, and proceeded to project power into Ireland. Although originally opposed to the English invasion of Ireland, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r adeptly recognised the English ascendancy in the Irish Sea region and aligned himself with the English. All later kings of the Crovan dynasty descended from Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r. In the last year of his father's reign, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r was absent at the court of Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway, forging closer ties with the Kingdom of Norway. When \u00d3l\u00e1fr was assassinated by rival members of the Crovan dynasty in 1153, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r returned to the Isles, overthrew his usurping cousins, and seized the throne for himself. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r evidently pursued a more aggressive policy than his father, and the following year appears to have lent military assistance to Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain in the latter's bid for the high-kingship of Ireland. Not long afterwards, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r faced a dynastic challenge from his brother-in-law, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll, whose son, as a grandson of \u00d3l\u00e1fr, possessed a claim to the throne. Late in 1156, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r and Somaile fought an inconclusive sea-battle and partitioned the kingdom of the Isles between them. Two years later Somairle stuck again and forced Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r from the Isles altogether. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appears to have spent his exile in the kingdoms of England and Scotland before journeying to Norway. In about 1161, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r distinguished himself in the ongoing Norwegian civil wars at the final downfall of Ingi. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r made his return to the Isles in 1164, in the aftermath of Somairle's defeat and death at the hands of the Scots. Although he regained the kingship itself, the territories ceded to Somairle in 1156 were retained by the latter's descendants. At some point in his career, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r briefly held the kingship of Dublin. Although he was initially successful in fending off Muirchertach, the Dubliners eventually settled with the latter, and Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r returned to the Isles. This episode may have bearing on Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's marriage to Findguala ingen N\u00e9ill, Muirchertach's granddaughter. In 1170, Dublin fell to an Anglo-Irish alliance. The following year the ousted King of Dublin attempted to retake the town, and Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht attempted to dislodge the English from Dublin. In both cases, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r appears to have provided military assistance against the English. In succeeding years, however, Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r aligned himself with one of the most powerful English conquerors, John de Courcy. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's assistance to John, who had married Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r's daughter, Affrica, may have played a critical role in John's successful conquest of the Kingdom of Ulaid. Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r died in 1187 and was succeeded by his eldest son, R\u01ebgnvaldr. Although Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r may have attempted to avert any succession disputes between his descendants, R\u01ebgnvaldr and his younger brother, \u00d3l\u00e1fr svarti, eventually fought each other over the throne, and the resulting conflict carried on into later generations.\nDocument[3](Title: Robert Douglas, 8th Earl of Morton) Robert Douglas, Earl of Morton (died 12 November 1649) was a Scottish nobleman and Earl of Morton.

Upon his father's death in 1360, William became Count of Berg and Ravensberg, a title that his father had gained by marrying the heiress of Berg and Ravensberg.

By means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate claim to the English throne than King Henry VII himself through the first two wives of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster: Blanche of Lancaster and Constance of Castile. In contrast, Henry VII was the descendant of Gaunt's third marriage to Katherine Swynford, whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimised after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimised, were barred from inheriting the English throne, a stricture that was ignored in later generations. Because of Henry's descent through illegitimate children barred from succession to the English throne, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all European kingdoms. At the time, the House of Trast\u00e1mara was the most prestigious in Europe, due to the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon's ancestry. It would have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne. The two were married by proxy on 19 May 1499 and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen, when it was decided that they were old enough to be married.\nDocument[2](Title: Ed Cray) Ed Cray( died October 8, 2019) was an American journalist, biographer and educator.

Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\"During the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.Princess Elizabeth went in 1947 on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\"\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Princess Amelia Of Great Britain born?": [

He was interested in the latest scientific advances. He was an agriculturist and a friend of the agricultural writer Arthur Young, and was an enthusiastic canal builder who invested in many commercial ventures for the improvement of his estates. He played a limited role in politics. He was a great patron of art and the painter J. M. W. Turner lived for a while at his Sussex seat of Petworth House. Several other painters including John Constable, C. R. Leslie, George Romney, the sculptor John Flaxman, and other talented artists received commissions from Wyndham, who filled his house with valuable works of art. The earl was a sponsor of the Petworth Emigration Scheme intended to relieve rural poverty caused by overpopulation. Generous and hospitable, blunt and eccentric, the earl was in his day a very prominent figure in English society. Charles Greville assessed him as \"immensely rich and his munificence was equal to his wealth\" and wrote that \"in his time Petworth was like a great inn.\" Though Wyndham had more than 40 children, the only legitimate one died in infancy. Lord Egremont was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont (1786-1845), but bequeathed his unentailed estates, namely the former Percy estates including Petworth House in Sussex, Leconfield Castle in Yorkshire and Egremont Castle in Cumbria, to his eldest illegitimate son Col.

Wibberley, who published more than 100 books, is perhaps best known for five satirical novels about an imaginary country Grand Fenwick, particularly\" The Mouse That Roared\"( 1955). Wibberley's adult and juvenile publications cut across the categories of fictional novels, history, and biography. He also wrote short stories( several published in\" The Saturday Evening Post\"), plays and long verse poems. Some of his books are in series. Besides the' Mouse' series, as Leonard Holton, he created the eleven- novel' Father Bredder' mystery series( basis of a television series,\" Sarge\") about\" a major figure in the clerical crime drama\". Among his more than 50 juvenile books are( with Farrar, Straus and Giroux), a seven- volume' Treegate' series of historical fiction and a four- volume life of Thomas Jefferson. As Patrick O'Connor, he wrote the Black Tiger series on auto racing, for young adults. Wibberley is also classified as a science fiction writer. Throughout the decades, scenes and senses of the sea play important parts in both Wibberley's fiction and nonfiction. Three of his novels have been made into movies:\" The Mouse That Roared\"( 1959),\" The Mouse on the Moon\"( 1963), and\" The Hands of Cormac Joyce\"( 1972).\n\nQuestion: Are Walter E.

Born in Gloucestershire and graduating from Oxford University, Potter initially worked in journalism. After standing for parliament as a Labour candidate at the 1964 general election, his health was affected by the onset of psoriatic arthropathy which necessitated Potter changing careers and led to him becoming a television dramatist.

He made twenty-nine films, including \"L'amour fou\" (1969), \"Out 1\" (1971), \"Celine and Julie Go Boating\" (1974), and \"La Belle Noiseuse\" (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times. Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker, Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty. He moved to Paris to pursue his career, frequenting Henri Langlois' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs; there, he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, \u00c9ric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave. Rivette began writing film criticism, and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" in 1953. In his criticism, he expressed an admiration for American films \u2013 especially those of genre directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray \u2013 and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema. Rivette's articles, admired by his peers, were considered the magazine's best and most aggressive writings, particularly his 1961 article \"On Abjection\" and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut. He continued making short films, including \"Le Coup de Berger\", which is often cited as the first New Wave film. Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement. Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film, \"Paris Belongs to Us\" was not released until 1961, by which time Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide. Rivette became editor of \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film, \"The Nun\" (1966). He then re-evaluated his career, developing a unique cinematic style with \"L'amour fou\". Influenced by the political turmoil of May 68, improvisational theatre and an in-depth interview with filmmaker Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour \"Out 1\" which, although rarely screened, is considered a Holy Grail of cinephiles. His films of the 1970s, such as \"Celine and Julie Go Boating\", often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years. During the early 1980s, he began a business partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, and his film \"La Belle Noiseuse\" received international praise. He retired after completing \"Around a Small Mountain\" (2009), and it was revealed three years later that he had Alzheimer's disease. Very private about his personal life, Rivette was briefly married to photographer and screenwriter Maril\u00f9 Parolini during the early 1960s and later married V\u00e9ronique Manniez.\nDocument[3](Title: Darren Aronofsky) Darren Aronofsky( born February 12, 1969) is an American filmmaker and screenwriter, who is noted for his surreal, melodramatic, and often disturbing films. Aronofsky attended Harvard University, where he studied film and social anthropology, and the American Film Institute where he studied directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film,\" Supermarket Sweep\", which went on to become a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller\" Pi\", was shot in November 1997. The low- budget,$ 60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for$ 1 million, and grossed over$ 3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. Aronofsky's followup, the psychological drama\" Requiem for a Dream\", was based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. The film also generated considerable controversy due to the graphic nature of several scenes, and was eventually released unrated. After writing the World War II horror film\" Below\", Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama\" The Fountain\". The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following. His fourth film, the sports drama\" The Wrestler\", was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, received Academy Award nominations. In 2010, Aronofsky was an executive producer on\" The Fighter\" and his fifth feature film, the psychological horror film\" Black Swan\", received further critical acclaim and many accolades, being nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director; Natalie Portman won Best Actress for her performance in the film. Aronofsky also received nominations for Best Director at the Golden Globes, and a Directors Guild of America Award nomination for his work on\" Black Swan\". Aronofsky's sixth film, the biblically inspired epic\" Noah\", was released in 2014 becoming Aronofsky's first film to open at No.1 at box office. His seventh film, the psychological horror\" mother!\"( 2017), sparked controversy upon release due to its biblical allegories and depiction of violence, and polarized audiences.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born later, The Man Who Murdered or Newness?": [

The film was directed by Julien Duvivier, and stars Harry Baur as Herod, Jean Gabin as Pontius Pilate, and Robert Le Vigan plays Jesus of Nazareth. In 1935, the film opened in France, and in 1937 in United States and played throughout Europe. However, the British Board of Film Censors \"would not allow British eyes to see it.\" Le Vigan's performance marks the first direct portrayal of Christ in a sound film.

P. Dutta. It was written by Javed Akhtar, composed by Anu Malik and sung by Roop Kumar Rathod and Sonu Nigam. The song describes the pain of Indian soldiers and was one of the reasons for the success of the film. For a \"heart-touching\" song which \"became the nation's anthem\", Akhtar won the Filmfare Award and the Screen Award in 1997 and 1998 respectively. He also won the National Film Award for the movie. Nigam won the Zee Cine Award for the song along with the \"Aashirwad Award\" and \"Sansui Viewers' Choice Award\". Nigam was however disappointed with the fact that Rathod was not nominated for the awards, saying that Rathod also played an equal part in the song's success. Talking about the song's popularity, Nigam said,\"I knew the song was popular, but I had no idea how big it was, and how big it was going to be in a few months. \" In an interview, Malik said that the song \"rocked the world\", and felt that he deserved the National Award for it. He said that he made the song for the soldiers \"to sing in their bunkers\", and it took seven-and-a-half minutes for him to compose the song. During the screening of \"LOC Kargil\", Dutta told Malik that an Indian soldier joined the army after hearing the song, and died in the war. The soldier's mother said to Dutta that she does not know whether she should love him or hate him, but thanked him for making \"LOC Kargil\", adding that he made his son \"live again\".

It is perhaps best known for starting the\" cannibal boom\" of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Lenzi was probably trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema, which had gained considerable Grindhouse popularity since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara made\" Mondo Cane\" in 1962, even though this film is fictional. Like\" Man from Deep River\", Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations, graphic violence, and animal cruelty. The film was mainly inspired by\" A Man Called Horse\", which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive.

July 6, 1744) \u2013 November 23, 1814) was an American politician and diplomat. As a Democratic-Republican he served as the fifth vice president of the United States under President James Madison from March 1813 until his death in November 1814. The phenomenon of gerrymandering was named after him. Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gerry vocally opposed British colonial policy in the 1760s, and was active in the early stages of organizing the resistance in the American Revolutionary War. Elected to the Second Continental Congress, Gerry signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. He was one of three men who attended the Constitutional Convention in 1787 who refused to sign the United States Constitution because it did not then include a Bill of Rights. After its ratification he was elected to the inaugural United States Congress, where he was actively involved in drafting and passage of the Bill of Rights as an advocate of individual and state liberties. Gerry was at first opposed to the idea of political parties, and cultivated enduring friendships on both sides of the political divide between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. He was a member of a diplomatic delegation to France that was treated poorly in the XYZ Affair, in which Federalists held him responsible for a breakdown in negotiations. Gerry thereafter became a Democratic-Republican, running unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts several times before winning the office in 1810. During his second term, the legislature approved new state senate districts that led to the coining of the word \"gerrymander\"; he lost the next election, although the state senate remained Democratic-Republican. Chosen by Madison as his vice presidential candidate in 1812, Gerry was elected, but died a year and a half into his term. He is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence who is buried in Washington, DC.\nDocument[2](Title: George Pavlopoulos) George Pavlopoulos (22 June 1924 \u2013 26 November 2008) was a Greek poet, relatively unknown outside Greece, but admired within his own country by fellow poets such as George Seferis. George or Giorgos or Giorgis or Georgios Pavlopoulos as known in the literature field, was born in Pyrgos, on the west coast of the Peloponnese in Greece. Before World War II Pyrgos was a rich provincial centre and Pavlopoulos's father ran a local restaurant and cake shop. He was educated at primary and secondary levels in Pyrgos, a childhood illness left him permanently lame. He attended the School of Law at the University of Athens He did not complete his degree and returned to Pyrgos where he worked as book-keeper and secretary for the local bus company. Upon his return from Athens he married a local girl and had a son called Haralabos. Childhood friends of his in Pyrgos included the musician Mikis Theodorakis and Takis Sinopoulos the poet. In 1943, during the German occupation, the local bishop allowed Pavlopoulos access to the cathedral printing press. With some of his school friends he printed and published a magazine called Odyssey containing his first published poem. This group included Takis Sinopoulos with whom he later wrote experimental cooperative poetry. The group performed a play, advertised with posters proclaiming Freedom or Death. The text was controversial and landed Pavlopoulos in trouble with the local Gestapo, who asked who had written it. Pavlopoulos had eventually to pretend that it was by Victor Hugo, although it had been written by themselves. The Nazi withdrawal at close of war lead to bitter fighting between factions in the resistance. The unhappiness of war and civil war is reflected in much of Pavlopoulos's poetry. His poetry has been translated into other languages, including: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish. He has taken part in cultural festivals in Greece and elsewhere and is a founder member of the Greek Society of Authors. He died on 26 November 2008.\nDocument[3](Title: George III of the United Kingdom) George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 \u2013 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820. He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (\"Hanover\") in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two predecessors, he was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover. George's life and reign, which were longer than those of any of his predecessors, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In the later part of his life, George had recurrent, and eventually permanent, mental illness. Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established. His eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent until his father's death, when he succeeded as George IV. Historical analysis of George III's life has gone through a \"kaleidoscope of changing views\" that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them.\n\nQuestion: Who died earlier, Chiang Chung-Ling or George Andreadis?": [

The song was not immediately played during the 1975 portions of the Born to Run Tour, but later became a frequent set- opener, especially during the 1976 and 1977 legs. It was still sometimes being used as an opening song decades later during the 2007 \u2013 2008 Magic Tour. The mood of the music is mostly exciting as are the lyrics which have a romantic quality as well. The music is propelled by Gary Tallent's bass. It is similar to the album's famous title track in that both songs deal with men and their fast cars. The lyrics mostly describe the central character as a blue collar worker who, after working a full day, runs off into the night to go drag racing and search for the love of a woman. For the protagonist, the only freedom and joy comes when he is on the highway, and he lives for the nights and weekends when he can escape work. Like a couple of other songs on\" Born to RunTenth Avenue Freeze- Out\" and\" She's the One\", the story of the relationship is told in a flashback. The desperation and darkness of the lyrics makes a strong contrast with some of the other songs on the\" Born to Run\" album, which glorify night life. Although\" Night\" and\" Born to Run\" show Springsteen beginning to deal seriously with blue collar protagonists, he would develop the theme further on his next album,\" Darkness on the Edge of Town\", in which he would portray additional facets of blue collar working life on songs such as\" Badlands Adam Raised a Cain The Promised LandProve It All Night\" and, especially,\" Factory\". This central theme would later be explored on\" The River\", especially in the song\" Out in the Street\", and became a focus of Springsteen's post-\" Darkness on the Edge of Town\" songwriting dealing with working class characters leading dead- end lives. In 1979, it was released as the B-side of the\" Rosalita( Come Out Tonight)\" single in Europe. The song was recorded in a style similar to the album's title track\" Born to Run\". Springsteen wanted to emulate record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique where multiple instruments played at the same time with their sounds bleeding into each other's microphones. The result is a\" wash\" of sound where some individual instruments are difficult to define, yet blend in to create a dense orchestral ambiance.\nDocument[2](Title: IPod) Apple's application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a patent on \"rotational user inputs\", as used on the iPod interface, received a third \"non-final rejection\" (NFR) in August 2005.

He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.\nDocument[2](Title: Paul Allen) Allen was born on January 21, 1953, in Seattle, Washington, to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye (n\u00e9e Gardner) Allen. Allen attended Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, where he befriended the two-years-younger Bill Gates, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers. They used Lakeside's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems. They also used the laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the University of Washington, doing personal research and computer programming; on at least one occasion in 1971 they were banned from the laboratory for abuse of their privileges there. According to Allen, in their teenage years he and Bill Gates would go dumpster-diving for computer program code. After graduating and obtaining a perfect SAT score of 1600, Allen went to Washington State University, where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity.

Born Ellis O'Neill , she was the third daughter of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone the leading Gaelic figure in Ireland. Her mother was Hugh's fourth wife, Catherine Magennis, daughter of Sir Hugh Magennis. Her marriage to Randal MacDonnell was a dynastic match that brought Tyrone into alliance with the MacDonnells, the dominant family in northern County Antrim who also had strong connections in Scotland. Tyrone's other children made similar marriages with leading families across Ulster. During Tyrone's Rebellion (1594-1603) Randal supported his father-in-law, but in the closing stages of the conflict he changed sides. He was eventually rewarded for this by the Crown when he was made Earl of Antrim and his wife thereby became a Countess. Despite being a Gaelic Catholic, Randal was a strong supporter of settling Scottish Protestants along the Eastern Ulster coastline, anticipating the Ulster Plantation which took place in six of the more western counties of the province. Ellis's husband became the most senior Gaelic aristocrat in Ulster following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, when her father fled into exile in Continental Europe. Her husband died in 1636.

Mary was a member of the House of Dunkeld by birth, and was Countess of Boulogne by marriage. In 1086, Mary and her sister, Matilda, were sent by their parents to Romsey. Their maternal aunt, Christina, was abbess there. The girls spent their early life at the monastery with their aunt, where they also received part of their education. Some time before 1093, they went to Wilton Abbey, which also had a reputation as a centre of learning, to finish their education. Matilda received many proposals for marriage but refused them all for the time being. Matilda finally left the monastery in 1100 to marry King Henry I of England. The marriage was controversial because it was not clear whether the girls had been veiled as nuns. Mary herself left the abbey in 1096. Matilda wanted her to also marry, so Henry I arranged a match with Eustace III, Count of Boulogne. The couple had a daughter, Matilda, who succeeded Eustace and later became Queen of England. Mary died in 1116, nine years before her husband. She was buried at the Cluniac abbey at Bermondsey.\nDocument[3](Title: Guigues VII of Viennois) Guigues VII( 1225 \u2013 1269), of the House of Burgundy, was the dauphin of Vienne and count of Albon, Grenoble, Oisans, Brian\u00e7on, Embrun, and Gap from 1237 to his death. He was the son of Andrew Guigues VI and Beatrice of Montferrat. When his father died, his mother helped guide the leadership of the new Dauphin. He fought great contests over the counties of Embrun and Gap with Charles, Count of Provence and Forcalquier. Those counties were the dowry of his father's first wife, Beatrice of Forcalquier. Guigues VI had repudiated his first wife and married a second, giving the counties of his former wife to the son of his second: Guigues VII. Charles, as heir to the county of Forcalquier, claimed the counties. A compromise was eventually reached whereby Guigues retained Embrun, but Charles received Gap. In 1239, the young Dauphin entered negotiations to marry Cecile of Baux with the help of his ally, Raymond VII of Toulouse. Cecile's father, Barral later claimed that he only negotiated the engagement under threats against his life. In 1241, he became engaged to Beatrice of Savoy, daughter of Peter of Savoy and Agnes of Faucigny. Peter's brother, Philip agreed to help the Dauphin fight the count of Valentinois. In 1247, Guigues was summoned by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor to join the army he was assembling in Savoy. This army was being gathered to attack the Pope in Lyon, though ultimately Frederick was distracted by other battles in Italy. In 1253, Guigues married Beatrice( 1237 \u2013 1310). For her dowry, Beatrice brought Guigues Faucigny, a distant territory menacing Savoy, the traditional enemy of the Viennois. Many wars of Guigues' descendants would be aimed at the defence of this land from the Savoyard counts. Guigues had two sons and a daughter:\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Renaud Iii, Count Of Soissons?": [

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed \"The Wages of Fear\" and \"Les Diaboliques\", which are critically recognized as among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including \"The Mystery of Picasso\", which was declared a national treasure by the government of France. Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film \"Le Corbeau\" drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including \"Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\". After the release of his comedy film \"Miquette et sa m\u00e8re\", Clouzot married V\u00e9ra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for \"The Wages of Fear\" and \"Les Diaboliques\". Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9\", Clouzot's wife V\u00e9ra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave.

He was the son of Charles, Count of Angoul\u00eame, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII, who died without a son. A prodigious patron of the arts, he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, including Leonardo da Vinci, who brought the \"Mona Lisa\" with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France, the spread of humanism and Protestantism, and the beginning of French exploration of the New World. Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire. For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as \"le P\u00e8re et Restaurateur des Lettres\" (the \"Father and Restorer of Letters\"). He was also known as \"Fran\u00e7ois du Grand NezFrancis of the Large Nose\"), the \"Grand Colas\", and the \"Roi-Chevalier\" (the \"Knight-King\") for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain. Following the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the Italian Wars. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.

H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sophie Emilie Rosen, known as Jelka, was born in Belgrade in 1868. She was the youngest of five children born to Georg Rosen (1820\u22121891) and his wife Serena Anna (1830\u22121902), also a painter, and the only daughter of the composer Ignaz Moscheles. Jelka Rosen studied art from 1892 at the private Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi in Paris, accompanied by her newly widowed mother. Living in Montparnasse, she made the acquaintance of the composers Gabriel Faur\u00e9, Maurice Ravel and Florent Schmitt and artists Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Paul Gauguin, Henri Rousseau, Edvard Munch and Ida Gerhardi. She exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. She met Frederick Delius at a dinner party on 16 January 1896, and found they had a shared interest in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche and the music of Edvard Grieg. In 1897 Delius returned from business in Florida, where he had managed an orange plantation twelve years previously; he moved into her newly-acquired house in Grez-sur-Loing house owned by her and her mother, and they married in September 1903. She was heiress to a modest fortune from her distinguished Schleswig-Holstein family and her wealth gave Delius financial security. Through her parental heritage, Jelka was widely read and spoke a number of languages, and it was she who often suggested texts her husband could set to music. She identified the works of Ernest Dowson for his \"Songs of Sunset\", and Walt Whitman for \"Songs of Farewell\". Her German translations of these texts were often published along with the music. Her artistic skills were also invaluable in sketching designs for the scenery in Beecham's 1920 revival of \"A Village Romeo and Juliet\". Her own artwork appeared on the vocal score to \"Fennimore and Gerda\". She remained devoted to Delius despite his affairs with other women. In the last twelve years of Delius's life, after he became blind and paralysed with third-stage syphilis, she gave up her work to be his caregiver. She herself became ill with bowel cancer, and made it known that outside help would be welcome. This led to Eric Fenby offering his services to the composer as an amanuensis, but he often served as Delius's personal nurse. Fenby worked with Delius for six years, during which time Jelka had intermittent absences for medical treatment. She returned from a nursing home to be at Delius's side when he died in June 1934. Delius had wished to be buried in the garden of their home at Grez-sur-Loing, or failing that, in England. The local authorities would not permit a garden burial, and Jelka was too ill to travel, so Delius was buried in the local cemetery at Grez. In May 1935, although she had not recovered fully, she felt she had enough strength to undertake the Channel crossing to attend his reinterment in the churchyard of the Church of Saint Peter, Limpsfield, Surrey. However, en route she contracted pneumonia and was hospitalised in Dover on arrival in England. She was then transferred to a hospital in Kensington, London, where she died on 28 May 1935, two days after her husband's reburial. She was buried with him: they share the same grave. Her estate funded a trust, managed by Sir Thomas Beecham, to promote the works of Delius. Beecham is now buried a short distance away. Jelka Rosen was portrayed by the British actress Maureen Pryor in the 1968 Ken Russell film \"Song of Summer\".\n\nQuestion: Who was born first out of Adnen Helali and Maria Poulsen?": [

She specialises in the history of philosophy \u2014 with particular interest in Ren\u00e9 Descartes and David Hume but she has also contributed to feminist philosophy. She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, where she was a student of Ferdinand Alqui\u00e9, and the University of Helsinki, where she was a student of Ingmar P\u00f6rn and Georg Henrik von Wright. In the 1980s she taught at the University of Pittsburgh in the USA and in Helsinki before being named professor of philosophy at Uppsala University in 1997. In her critically received book on Descartes (2003), Alanen goes beyond mere history, drawing out the historical antecedents and the intellectual evolution of Descartes' thinking about the mind, showing how his emphasis on the embodiment of the mind has implications far more complex and interesting than the usual dualist account associated with his thinking suggests. Lilli Alanen is a member of the industrialist Ahlstr\u00f6m family. Her mother was Finnish art collector and patron of the arts Maire Gullichsen and her father the industrialist Harry Gullichsen. Her siblings are the renowned Finnish architect Kristian Gullichsen and Johan Gullichsen, a professor of engineering.

The film is based on the book\" Le Dernier Mitterrand\" by Georges- Marc Benamou. Benamou had talked with and accompanied Mitterrand for the last 1,000 days of his presidency. Benamou worked for a small circulation magazine called\" Globe\"- a magazine for\" champagne socialistsla gauche caviar\" in the French idiom. It is not clear why Mitterrand chose Benamou but the journalist has said they got on well and discussed life, women and literature. When the resulting book appeared in 1997 however, Benamou was turned upon by many of Mitterrand's family and associates- even Pierre Berg\u00e9, who financed the\" Globe\" magazine called it a work of\" absolute treachery\"- and they would not help with the film. It seems they were particularly outraged not by revelations about Mitterrand's private life,- Mitterrand had a secret second family including the daughter he kept hidden from the public- or anything to do with Vichy, but with a description of Mitterrand devouring a plateful of ortolans. The bird is a protected species and eating them forbidden under EU law. Certain other people at the dinner called Benamou a liar saying this incident never happened. Benamou denied this. In 2004 one of Mitterrand's closest associates, who had also been at the meal said Benamou was right but no ortolans appear in the film and Mitterrand eats a plate of oysters. Benamou, an Algerian born Sephardic Jew, asserted that he had not found Mitterrand anti-semitic either in his time in Vichy or afterwards,- something that Mitterrand, who sometimes spoke of' le lobby juif', his term for some French Jews' and their focus on his wartime record- had been accused of. Benamou defended Mitterrand in spite of his protection of collaborators like Ren\u00e9 Bousquet and Maurice Papon-\" Papon became a minister under Giscard d'Estaing; he was chief of police under de Gaulle. This is not a secret of Mitterrand[ but of] the French bourgeoisie and Mitterrand was an emblem of that.\" The film won a C\u00e9sar award for Michel Bouquet in his role as Mitterrand.\nDocument[2](Title: The Secret of Dr. Mabuse) The Secret of Dr. Mabuse or The Death Ray of Dr. Mabuse (German:Die Todesstrahlen des Dr. Mabuse) is a 1964 Franco-German international co-production science fiction Eurospy crime film directed by Hugo Fregonese and Victor De Santis and starring Peter van Eyck, O.E.

After the war, Chouteau was arrested in 1817 by the Spanish during a trading expedition on the upper Arkansas River, as they considered that area under their control and excluded others from its lucrative trading. He was imprisoned in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After being released, Chouteau continued the family trade among the Osage. He established his home in present-day Salina, Oklahoma, part of the western extent of their territory. In 1832, Washington Irving visited the post and described it in \"Tour of the Prairies\".

Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, \"Two for the Road\", was composed by Mancini, who wrote many notable theme songs for films, including \"Moon River\" for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". He considered \"Two for the Road\" his favourite of all the songs he wrote. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coup\u00e9, VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re-establish the time period after a jump.

He was a member of Adolf Hitler's entourage and brother-in-law to Eva Braun through his marriage to her sister Gretl. Fegelein joined a cavalry regiment of the Reichswehr in 1925 and transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933. He became a leader of an SS equestrian group, and was in charge of preparation for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. He tried out for the Olympic equestrian team himself but was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. In September 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, Fegelein commanded the SS \"Totenkopf Reiterstandarte\" (Death's-Head Horse Regiment). They were garrisoned in Warsaw until December. In May and June 1940, he participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (later renamed the \"Waffen-SS\"). For his service in these campaigns he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940. Units under his command on the Eastern Front in 1941 were responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 civilians during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation in the Byelorussian SSR. As commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" in 1943, he was involved in operations against partisans as well as defensive operations against the Red Army, for which he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze. After being seriously wounded in September 1943, Fegelein was reassigned by Heinrich Himmler to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS. Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life on 20 July 1944. He was on duty at Hitler's \"F\u00fchrerbunker\" in Berlin in the closing months of the war, and was shot for desertion on 28 April 1945, two days before Hitler's suicide. Fegelein was an opportunist who ingratiated himself with Himmler, who granted him the best assignments and rapid promotions. Historians William L. Shirer and Ian Kershaw characterise him as cynical and disreputable. Albert Speer called him \"one of the most disgusting people in Hitler's circle\".\nDocument[2](Title: Apollo Mussin-Pushkin) Count Apollos Apollosovich Musin-Pushkin (February 17, 1760 \u2013 April 18, 1805) was a Russian chemist and plant collector.

Johann Nepomuk was named after the Bohemian Saint Johann von Nepomuk. Some view this name as evidence that Nepomuk and subsequently his great-grandson Adolf Hitler had Czech ancestry. However, Johann von Pomuk/Johann Nepomuk, was an important saint for Bohemians of both German and Czech ethnicity. Nepomuk thus only indicates ties to Bohemia and central Europe. Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792\u20131873) who was fifteen years his senior. On 19 January 1830, Eva Hiedler gave birth to Johanna. Legally, he was the step-uncle of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), the stepson of his brother Johann Georg Hiedler, a wandering miller. For reasons unknown, Johann Nepomuk took in Alois when he was a boy and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, Alois' natural father but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. Another, and perhaps simpler, explanation for this kindness is that Nepomuk took pity on the ten-year-old Alois and took him in. Alois was, after all, the stepson of his brother Johann Georg, and Nepomuk may have known that in fact Alois was Johann Georg's natural child. After the death of Alois' mother Maria, it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Nepomuk left Alois a considerable portion of his life savings. Nepomuk's granddaughter, Klara, had a longstanding affair with Alois before marrying him in 1885 after the death of his second wife. In 1889 she gave birth to Adolf Hitler.\n\nQuestion: Was Ralf Wohlleben or Ilya Tyapkin born first?": [

The film, written by Simon and directed by Glenn Jordan, stars Marsha Mason, Joan Hackett, James Coco, and Kristy McNichol. It also features two short scenes with then-unknowns Kevin Bacon and John Vargas. Simon's next release, \"I Ought to Be in Pictures\", was released just six months later, and its plot was similar. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Marsha Mason), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (James Coco), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Joan Hackett). \"Only When I Laugh\" proved to be very successful at the box office.

Upon the death of her brother, Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross, she became the heir-presumptive of her niece Euphemia II, Countess of Ross although her husband Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles pressed Mariota's superior claim to the earldom. Domhnall attempted to gain control of the earldom, and sometime after 1405 but before 1411, Domhnall gained control of Dingwall Castle. In the year after the death of the nominal king Robert III of Scotland (1406), in August 1407, Domhnall sent emissaries to England to the heir of the throne, the captive James Stewart. King Henry IV of England sent his own emissaries the following year to negotiate an alliance against Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, the Guardian of Scotland who was controlling Euphemia and the earldom. With control over the principal seat of the earldom of Ross and support of the exiled heir to the Scottish throne, in 1411 Domhnall felt strong enough to march against Albany's main northern ally, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. At the Battle of Harlaw Domhnall failed to inflict a decisive victory, and withdrew back to the western highlands. In the aftermath, Albany was able to retake Dingwall and seize control of Easter Ross. In 1415, Euphemia was persuaded by Albany to resign the earldom to his own second son, John Stewart, Earl of Buchan. This action was challenged by Domhnall of Islay, who continued to claim the earldom on behalf of Mariota. After the return of King James the latter destroyed the power of the Albany Stewarts, executing the Albany's son and successor Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany.

She was betrothed to Sigismund, Archduke of Austria. She was born in the city of Chinon in August 1428, as evidenced by an act of the Queen's Treasurer General dated August 29 of this year, referring to the \"gesine recently made in the city of Chinon, Madame Arragonde of France\" The young princess, the eldest daughter of the king, was baptized in honour of Saint Radegund, to whom her father devoted a particular cult. According to Christian de M\u00e9rindol, this choice was explained by reasons both political, historical and religious, in this particular context of reconquest of the kingdom of France on the English: \"The name of Radegonde had several meanings: symbol of the city of Poitiers, seat of the second Parliament, so place of resistance in Paris, in the hands of the English and Burgundians, symbol of legitimacy, because the saint was the wife of Clotaire, the son of Clovis, finally a saint who could only attract the graces of heaven, so necessary to the young king. \" She is the only princess of royal blood to have borne this name within the Capetian lineage. On April 22, 1430, his father promised her in marriage to Sigismund, born in 1427, son of the Archduke Frederick of Austria, Count of Tyrol. She became ill in Tours in 1445, perhaps suffering from pleurisy contracted after returning on foot from a pilgrimage to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de l'Epine. She died on March 19, at the age of 16 years. She is buried in the Saint-Gatien cathedral of Tours. Her fianc\u00e9, Sigismund of Austria, married in 1449 Eleanor of Scotland, daughter of King James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort.\nDocument[2](Title: Caroline Lacroix) Blanche Z\u00e9lia Jos\u00e9phine Delacroix, better known as Caroline Lacroix (13 May 1883 \u2013 12 February 1948), was the most prominent and notorious of Leopold II of Belgium's mistresses. Delacroix, who was of French origin, met the king in Paris as a young girl, when she was only 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living from prostitution. They soon embarked upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, \"baronne de Vaughan\" (Baroness Vaughan). Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited from the king's income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (\u201cThe Queen of the Congo\u201d). She and Leopold married in a religious ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income \u2013 all of which turned her into a multimillionaire. For years, the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.\nDocument[3](Title: Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay) Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay  is a 1971 French film by Bruno Gantillon, an erotic and parodic tale involving Morgan le Fay and a castle full of women in the French countryside.

His military campaigns (1534\u201349) created the largest kingdom in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287. His administratively fragile kingdom proved to be the impetus for the eventual reunification of the entire country by his successor and brother-in-law Bayinnaung. Based out of their small landlocked principality in the Sittaung valley, Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung began their military campaigns in 1534 against the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and had conquered the wealthier but disunited kingdom by 1541. He then leveraged the coastal kingdom's wealth, manpower and access to Portuguese mercenaries and firearms, and extended his rule to the ancient capital of Pagan (Bagan) in 1544. However, his attempts to build an East-West empire fell short in Arakan (1545\u201347) and in Siam (1547\u201349). He actively courted the support of ethnic Mons of Lower Burma, many of whom were appointed to the highest positions in his government and armed forces. His chief queen and chief primate were Mons. He moved the capital to Pegu (Bago). The king was assassinated on his 34th birthday on the orders of Smim Sawhtut, one of his close advisers. The kingdom he had built up fell apart right after his death, which Bayinnaung had to restore in the next two years. His premature death has been called \"one of the great turning points of mainland [Southeast Asia's] history\". He is one of the most celebrated kings in Burmese history.

He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour, and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films, while mild by modern standards, were unprecedented in his day. His first major gothic horror film was\" The Curse of Frankenstein\"( 1957), which launched Hammer's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era. He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects, including\" Dracula\"( 1958),\" The Mummy\"( 1959), and\" The Curse of the Werewolf\"( 1961). Given their subject matter and lurid approach, Fisher's films, though commercially successful, were largely dismissed by critics during his career. It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an\" auteur\" in his own right. His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality, morality, and \u2018 the charm of evil \u2019. Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook, there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason, in contrast to other characters, who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold, godless rationalism. For detailed discussions of Fisher's work, see\" Terence Fisher: Horror, Myth, and Religion\" by Paul Leggett( McFarland and Co, 2002),\" British Film Makers: Terence Fisher\" by Peter Hutchings( Manchester University Press, 2013), and\" The Films of Terence Fisher: Hammer Horror and Beyond\" by Wheeler Winston Dixon( Auteur Publishing, 2017).\nDocument[3](Title: The Golem (1915 film)) Der Golem( shown in the US as The Monster of Fate) is a 1915 German silent horror partially lost film, written and directed by Paul Wegener and Henrik Galeen.

Tavares). Thus, the American company White Castle is generally credited with opening the second fast - food outlet in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast - food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram's and Walter Anderson's White Castle System created the first fast food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain's prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald's Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc's McDonald's outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.\nDocument[2](Title: Reggae Report) Reggae Report was a U.S.- based music and culture magazine first published in 1983.

Peggy Quattro and Michael\" Zappow\" Williams. With combined industry connections and experience that bridged the gap from reggae's beginnings to the artists making the most popular music of the day, Quattro and Williams began\" Reggae Report\" to spread the word, educate the fans about its rich history, and bring up- close- and- personal interviews and photographs to a targeted international fan base. The Miami, Florida- based magazine owed its success to reggae's rising popularity. Its credibility and timeliness resulted in Reggae Report excelling in a market with limited print competition. Its mission was to introduce the music and accompanying culture and lifestyle to a large multi-ethnic US and North American base. The enthusiastic support shown by artists, musicians, and industry professionals in Jamaica, the UK, and the US resulted in increased advertising and distribution, as well as an enthusiastic international subscriber base. Reggae was still young in the early 1980s, and in the US it was basically undiscovered. By the late' 80s, the magazine had achieved regional, national, and international distribution. At its peak,\" Reggae Report\" was distributed in 42 countries. Advertisers ranged from record companies and record distributors, to airlines, clothing lines, beverages, food items, restaurants, accessories, and record and gift stores. Its growing popularity brought accolades, articles, and awards, but the dawning of instant Internet news resulted in the publication ceasing its print version. \" Reggae Report\" transformed into ReggaeReport.com in 1999 and it s online site is active today.\nDocument[3](Title: Scholars' Facsimiles & Reprints) Scholars' Facsimiles& Reprints was established in 1936 by Louis Sigmund Friedland( 1884 \u20131955), professor of English at New York University, with an editorial advisory council of 29 prominent scholars, and offices at 103 Park Avenue, New York City.

As queen of France, she participated in the unsuccessful Second Crusade. Soon afterwards, Eleanor sought an annulment of her marriage, but her request was rejected by Pope Eugene III. However, after the birth of her second daughter Alix, Louis agreed to an annulment, as 15 years of marriage had not produced a son.

He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films were more diverse in genre, among which included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years. DeMille directed \"The King of Kings\" (1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. \" The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \"Cleopatra\" (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), a biblical epic which became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism\", which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. His last and best known film, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, is currently the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for \"Union Pacific\" (1939), a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was named in his honor.

It was directed by Richard Sale and produced by the director with Bob Waterfield (Russell's husband) and Robert Bassler as executive producer. The script was written by Mary Loos and Sale, based on the novel \"But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes\" by Anita Loos, aunt of Mary Loos. Anita Loos was the author of the novel and play \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", which had been turned into a smash film with Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe two years before. The studio attempted to repeat the formula, with Russell returning but Jeanne Crain stepping in for a presumably otherwise engaged Monroe (both women played new characters). Alan Young (later the star of TV's \"Mr. Ed\"), Scott Brady (brother of Lawrence Tierney), and Rudy Vallee also appear. This film was not as well received as the earlier one. The choreography was by Jack Cole, who had also contributed to the \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" film. The dance ensemble includes the young Gwen Verdon. Anita Loos had entitled her book \" But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes\", but the studio dropped the first word from the title for the film.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born earlier, The Belle Of Broadway or Count Varenne'S Lover?": [

Filmed in the then recently introduced CinemaScope format and directed by Nicholas Ray, it offered both social commentary and an alternative to previous films depicting delinquents in urban slum environments. The film stars James Dean, Sal Mineo, and Natalie Wood. The film was a groundbreaking attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations. The title was adopted from psychiatrist Robert M. Lindner's 1944 book, \"Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath\". The film, however, does not make any references to Lindner's book in any way. Warner Bros. released the film on October 27, 1955, almost a month after Dean's death in a car accident on September 30, 1955. Over the years, the film has achieved landmark status for the acting of cultural icon Dean, fresh from his Oscar nominated role in \"East of Eden\" and who died before the film's release, in his most celebrated role. This was the only film during Dean's lifetime in which he received top billing. In 1990, \"Rebel Without a Cause\" was added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\".\nDocument[3](Title: Bradley Barker) Bradley Barker (January 18, 1883 \u2013 September 29, 1951) was an American actor and film director of the silent era.

The lyrics come from a poem written in Arabic by the last Abencerrages king of Granada, Aben Humeya, in a translation by Niceto de Zamacois, which Sevilla found in a magazine used as packing material. The Spanish lyrics use the image of a migrating swallow to evoke sentiments of longing for the homeland. It became the signature song of the exiled Mexicans. The song was recorded in 1906 by Se\u00f1or Francisco. A guitar instrumental was recorded by Chet Atkins in 1955. The song has also been recorded by Caterina Valente (1959), Nat King Cole (1962), Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (1984), Flaco Jim\u00e9nez (1992, instrumental), and Caetano Veloso (1994).

The song figures prominently in the 1969 film \"The Wild Bunch\", directed by Sam Peckinpah and scored by Jerry Fielding.

After enjoying success with experimental productions in Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg, Martin went to Berlin, where he premiered Ernst Toller's anti-war drama, \"TransfigurationDie Wandlung\") on September 30, 1919. Performed in a hall seating fewer than 300 spectators, the production used the intimacy of the space to drive home the horrors of Toller's script. The sets were jagged flats placed against blackness, and lit with harsh white spotlights. Scenes ended in blackouts not, as was customary at the time, with the curtain falling. Fritz Kortner became famous for his intense portrayal of the young hero. Martin turned to film in 1920, when he directed a cinematic adaptation of one of the most celebrated expressionist dramas, Georg Kaiser's \"From Morn to MidnightVon morgens bis mitternachts\") with actor Ernst Deutsch as the Cashier who embezzles money from a bank and goes on a desperate search for meaning in his life in a nightmarish metropolis.\nAfter World War II, Martin revived Bertolt Brecht's \"The Threepenny Opera\" in Berlin, and\npremiered Georg Kaiser's pacifist drama, \"The Soldier TanakaDer Soldat Tanaka\").\nDocument[2](Title: Night in Montmartre) Night in Montmartre is a 1931 British mystery film directed by Leslie S.

According to unreliable traditions Inge would have ruled together with his brother Philip Halstensson after the death of their uncle Inge the Elder: In English literature both have also been called \"Ingold\". Hallstein's sons were Philip and Ingi, and they succeeded to the Kingdom of Sweden after King Ingi the elder. (The 13th century \"Hervarar saga\") Other sources say that after the death of Philip (1118), Inge the Younger was the sole king of Sweden, but the year of his own death is unknown. According to the regnal list in the \"Westrogothic law\", Inge was poisoned with an evil drink in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland:\nNiun\u00f0i war Ingi konong\u00e6r, bro\u00f0her Philipus\u00e6r konongs, oc heter \u00e6ptir Ing\u00e6 kononge, Halstens konongs br\u00f8dh\u00e6r.

The tenth (Christian king) was king Inge, the brother of king Philip, and he was named after king Inge (the Elder). He was killed by evil drink in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland and it was his bane. But Sweden fared forever well, while these kinsmen ruled. It is not known whether Inge was still alive when the Norwegian king Sigurd I of Norway invaded Sm\u00e5land in 1123, but when Inge died, it was the end of the House of Stenkil. Inge is reported to have been married to Ulvhild H\u00e5kansdotter who was the daughter of the Norwegian Haakon Finnsson and who would later marry the Danish king Nils Svensson and even later the Swedish king Sverker the Elder.

The song was released as a single in the U.S. in July 1970, miscredited on the record label to \"Elton Johns\". The single was issued just as John's career was starting to take off, but was quickly withdrawn because both John and his then-current record company objected to its release. It is now an extremely rare collectors' item. John said of the song: Actually, \"From Denver to L.A.\" was withdrawn, so if you have got a copy, it's worth a small fortune.

He composed at least eighteen rags, including \"Ashy Africa,Noodles,Peaches and Cream\" (1905), \"Crab Apples,\" and \"The Smiler\" (1907). His songs include \"Wabash Avenue After Dark\" and the hits \"Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet\" (1909, lyrics by Stanley Murphy), \"When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose\" (1914, lyrics by Jack Mahoney) and \"Minnetonka\" (1921, lyrics by Gus Kahn). \"If It's Good Enough for Washington It's Good Enough for Me\" (1908, lyrics by Ren Shields) was a song about a homeless man sleeping on a bench in a public square with statues of Washington, Jefferson, McKinley, Grant and Lee.

His performances in numerous films during the Classical Hollywood era made him an American cultural icon. In 1999, the American Film Institute selected him as the greatest male star of classic American cinema. Bogart began acting in Broadway shows and began his movie career in \"Up the River\" (1930). The film also starred Spencer Tracy. Bogart played the romantic role in a part as large as Tracy's, despite Bogart's much lower billing. Bogart appeared in various supporting parts for several years, sometimes portraying gangsters due to his resemblance to John Dillinger. He was highly praised for his work in \"The Petrified Forest\" (1936), which was his big break into the Warner Bros. gangster pantheon. Bogart's breakthrough from supporting roles to A-list stardom came with \"High Sierra\" (1941), his last role as a gangster, and \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), considered to be one of the first great film noirs. His private detectives Sam Spade in \"The Maltese Falcon\" and Phillip Marlowe in \"The Big Sleep\" (1946) became the model for detectives in other film noirs. His first true romantic lead role came when he appeared alongside Ingrid Bergman in \"Casablanca\" (1942), although filming the pair involved efforts to mask the fact Bergman was taller than the 5'8\" (1.73 m) Bogart. \" Casablanca\", a Best Picture Academy Award Winner, landed him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Bogart and 19-year-old Lauren Bacall fell in love when they filmed \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944) and soon after the main filming for \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), their second film together, concluded in early 1945, he filed for divorce from his third wife and married Bacall. After their marriage, she also played his love interest in \"Dark Passage\" (1947), and \"Key Largo\" (1948). Bogart's performances in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), as a paranoid gold prospector, and \"In a Lonely Place\" (1950), as a screenwriter suspected of murder, are today considered to be his best, although they were not as recognized at their time of release. The unsettled, sometimes terrifying character he portrayed in these roles is again illustrated in his World War II war boat commander in \"The Caine Mutiny\" (1954), which was a critical and commercial smash, and garnered him another Best Actor nomination. It was for his cantankerous transport boat pilot alongside Katharine Hepburn's missionary in the World War I adventure \"The African Queen\" (1951) that Bogart won the Academy Award for Best Actor. In his later years significant roles included competing with William Holden for Audrey Hepburn in \"Sabrina\" (1954) and \"The Barefoot Contessa\" with Ava Gardner. A heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart died from esophageal cancer in January 1957.\nDocument[2](Title: Christina Hart) Christina Hart( born July 21, 1949) is an American film producer, film director, playwright and retired actress.

The album was one of many produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between October and December 1983, the album was Yankovic's follow- up to his modestly successful debut LP, Weird Al\" Yankovic\". The album is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies of artists like Michael Jackson, Men Without Hats, the Greg Kihn Band, the Police, and Survivor. The other half of the album contains many\" style parodies\", musical imitations that come close to, but do not directly copy a specific work by, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of artists like Bob Marley and the B- 52s. This album marked a musical departure from Yankovic's self- titled debut, in that the arrangements of the parodies were now closer to the originals. Also, the accordion was no longer used in every song, but only where deemed appropriate or comically inappropriate. The album is also notable for being the first album released by Yankovic to include a polka medley of hit songs. These pastiches of hit songs, set to polka music, have since appeared on nearly all of Yankovic's albums. Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3- D\" was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the\" Billboard\" 200 and number sixty- one in Australia. The album also produced one of Yankovic's most famous singles,\" Eat It\"( a parody of Michael Jackson's\" Beat It\"), which peaked at number twelve on the\" Billboard\" Hot 100. This song was Yankovic's highest charting single until\" White& Nerdy\" from his 2006 album\" Straight Outta Lynwood\" peaked at number nine in the October 21, 2006\" Billboard\" charts. \" Eat It\" also charted at number one in Australia, making it Yankovic's only number one single in any country. The album also produced two minor US hits,\" King of Suede\", which peaked at number sixty- two, and\" I Lost on Jeopardy\", which peaked at number eighty- one. The album was Yankovic's first Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. \" Eat It\" won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance Single or Album, Spoken or Musical in 1985.\nDocument[3](Title: (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding) ``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding ''is a 1974 song written by English singer / songwriter Nick Lowe and subsequently covered by Elvis Costello and Curtis Stigers.\n\nQuestion: Which album came out first, Kind Of Love or Around The Fur?": [

Justus was born and raised in Rome. He was the second son born to the Roman Jewish historian Josephus and his fourth wife, a distinguished unnamed Greek Jewish noblewoman from Crete. The parents of Justus met in Rome, and Josephus describes his mother, as one \u2018in character who excelled many women, as her subsequent life demonstrated\u2019. Justus had an older paternal half-brother, Hyrcanus, and a younger brother, Flavius Simonides Agrippa. His paternal uncle was Matthias, while his paternal grandparents were Matthias and his wife, an unnamed Jewish noblewoman. His paternal grandmother was an aristocratic woman who descended from royalty and of the former ruling Hasmonean Dynasty. His paternal grandfather descended from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the twenty four-orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem and was a descendant of the High Priest Jonathon. Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High Priest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC-76 BC. Justus\u2019 cognomen was a very common Latin name in the Jewish Catacombs of Rome. Josephus gave his son a Latin name in preference to a Greek one, despite the fact that Greek was spoken more among Roman Jews than Latin.

Taxi! is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring James Cagney and Loretta Young. The film includes two famous Cagney dialogues, one of which features Cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in Yiddish, and the other when Cagney is speaking to his brother's killer through a locked closet, Come out and take it, you dirty yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door! The provenance of this sequence led to Cagney being famously misquoted as saying, You dirty rat, you killed my brother. To play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest, Cagney recommended his pal, fellow tough-guy-dancer George Raft, who was uncredited in the film. In a lengthy and memorable sequence, the scene culminates with Raft and his partner winning the dance contest against Cagney and Young, after which Cagney slugs Raft and knocks him down. As in \"The Public Enemy\" (1931), several scenes in \"Taxi!\" involved the use of live machine gun bullets. After a few of the bullets narrowly missed Cagney's head, he outlawed the practice in his future films. In the film they see a fictitious Warner Bros. movie at the cinema called \"Her Hour of Love\" in which Cagney cracks a joke about the film's leading man's appearance (an unbilled cameo by Warners contract player Donald Cook, who had played Cagney's brother in \"The Public Enemy\") saying, \"his ears are too big\".

He was born in Macei\u00f3, Alagoas, and is best known as a member of the Cinema Novo movement. He is popularly known for his unconventional, yet intriguing film techniques among other film producers of the Cinema Novo movement. Diegues is also widely known for his dynamic use visuals, ideas, plots, themes, and other cinematic techniques. He incorporated many musical acts in his film as he favored musical pieces to be complementary of his ideas. Diegues remains very popular and is regarded one the most cinematic producers of his generation. Of the Cinema Novo directors, he would go on to produce films, plays, musicals and other forms of entertainment in Brazil. Diegues' contributions to Brazilian cinema developed the film industry. He would pioneer expensive film projects that domestic filmmakers had ever seen. Films such as \"Bye Bye Brazil\" were two million dollar projects and later on films such as \"God is Brazilian\" would be over 10 million dollars. This was a new era in Brazil as domestic directors had yet to produce any films with that kind of financial support. He admits to using Brazilians in his films as much as he can. Diegues would use extras, film technicians, painters, sculptors and other essential personnel of Brazilian backgrounds even if they were inexperienced. Diegues attempted to consistently represent the underrepresented people of Brazil in his films. He suggests that history is written by the winners and the afro-Brazilian communities were not among those who were given a chance to write their own history. He also proposed the idea that up until this movement, cinema in Brazil only provided the white Brazilian experience despite the growing masses of black Brazilians all over the country. He is known for distinguished publications that uplift the Afro-Brazilian spirit and bodies. In 2018, Diegues was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\nDocument[2](Title: Louis Mouchet) Louis Mouchet is an independent film- maker born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1957.\nDocument[3](Title: Jeanne de Salzmann) Jeanne de Salzmann born Jeanne- Marie Allemand often addressed as Madame de Salzmann( January 26, 1889, Reims \u2013 May 24, 1990, Paris) was the daughter of the famous Swiss architect Jules Louis Allemand and of Marie Louise Matignon.

Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the father and son of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone( Brando), focusing on the transformation of the son Michael Corleone( Pacino), raised to have a life outside of crime, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss. Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of$ 80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film. They and Coppola disagreed over the casting for several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place primarily on location around New York and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola. \" The Godfather\" premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on March 15, 1972, and was released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the highest- grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest- grossing film ever made, with a gross of around$ 245\u2013286 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going toward the performances of its cast, particularly by Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film revitalized Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s. In addition to starring in future hits such as\" Last Tango in ParisSuperman\", and\" Apocalypse Now\", Brando was a catalyst in this film for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast. At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor( Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay( for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall( Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola for Best Director. Since its release,\" The Godfather\" has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed\" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second- greatest film in American cinema( behind\" Citizen Kane\") by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels\" The Godfather Part II\"( 1974) and\" The Godfather Part III\"( 1990).\nDocument[3](Title: Yamla Pagla Deewana: Phir Se) Yamla Pagla Deewana: Phir Se  is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language action comedy film directed by Navaniat Singh.

Manuel Machado was the son of Antonio Machado \u00c1lvarez, known folklorist Seville nicknamed \"Dem\u00f3filo\", and Ana Ruiz. His brothers were also a poet Antonio Machado and Jos\u00e9 Machado. Inherited his father's love of popular Andalusian character. Born in San Pedro Martir Street No. 20, his childhood was spent in the Palacio de las Due\u00f1as, where his family had rented one of the zones reserved for individuals. When Manuel was 9, the whole family moved to Madrid, because the paternal grandfather had obtained a professorship at the Universidad Central. The desire of all the three brothers was studying in the Free Institution of Teaching, led by Francisco Giner de los R\u00edos, a great friend of the grandfather Manuel. The family moved to Madrid, where he developed his studies, culminating with a Bachelor of Arts. Since then, his family returned to Seville in few occasions, but Seville and Andalusia remained for him a living reference, though distant, for the love of his parents towards their land. In Madrid, Manuel began to publicize his first poetry and contributed to several literary life in Madrid along with writers like Francis and Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez Villaespesa. He was co-founder, on February 11, 1933 of the Association of Friends of the Soviet Union. Over the years, he became director of Madrid's Municipal Library (now the Municipal Historical Library) and Municipal Museum. He created several short-lived literary magazines and worked in daily newspapers in Europe and America.\nContributed strongly to the modernist poetry, understood in its most colorful, decadent, cosmopolitan, giving a hint of Andalusian poetry makes something unique. It has often been opposed to the modernist side of the 98 Generation. In 1936-during the civil war, was appointed to a seat in the Royal Spanish Academy. Brothers Manuel and Antonio wrote together several dramatic works of Andalusian. Manuel's most notable work is \"La Lola se va a los puertos\", filmed twice. Other dramatic works of Machado were the \"La duquesa de Benamej\u00edLa prima FernandaJuan de Ma\u00f1araEl hombre que muri\u00f3 en la guerra\" and \"Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valc\u00e1rcel\". Although the poetry of both is very different, we can see certain parallels. Thus, both paths composed autobiographical poems (\"Adelfos\" Manuel, and \"Portrait\", by Antonio) using Alexandrine verses organized in serventesios. The civil war separated the brothers, placing them on opposite sides. Upon arrival in Madrid after the Spanish coup of July 1936, Manuel gave the military an encomiastic poetry, \"The sword of the Caudillo. \" This earned him the recognition of the Nationalists. After the war he returned to his post as director of the Newspaper Library and the Municipal Museum of Madrid, who retired shortly thereafter. He continued to write poetry, mostly religious in nature. His Catholic faith was rekindled during your stay in Burgos thanks to the devotion of his wife and the influence of certain priests, as Bonifacio Zamora. The poet continued to write eulogies to various figures and symbols of Francoist Spain, which earned him the scorn of critics and later poets, who considered him a traitor to the Spanish Second Republic. On January 19, 1947 died in Madrid. After the poet's death, his widow entered a religious order dedicated to caring for abandoned and sick children. Then came the Spanish openness of the 60 and 70, Francisco Franco gave the youth side to the poets covered by Spain and embraced those who died, or still living-in-exile. Thus, the work and the figure of Manuel Machado were eclipsed by those of Antonio Machado, more akin to the taste of time.

Joe, also credited in prints as \"Ernie Pyle's Story of G.I. Joe\", is a 1945 American war film directed by William Wellman, starring Burgess Meredith and Robert Mitchum. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Mitchum's only nomination for Best Supporting Actor. This was the film that established him as one of the world's biggest movie stars. The story is a tribute to the American infantryman (\"G.I. Joe\") during World War II, told through the eyes of Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle, with dialogue and narration lifted from Pyle's columns. The film concentrates on one company, (\"C Company, 18th Infantry\"), that Pyle accompanies into combat in Tunisia and Italy. The friendships that grow out of his coverage led Pyle to relate the misery and sacrifice inherent in their plight and their heroic endurance of it. Although the company has the designation of an actual unit, that unit did not participate in the combat in Italy that makes up the preponderance of the film, and actually stands in for the units of the 34th and 36th Infantry Divisions that Pyle did cover in Italy. Although filmed with the cooperation of Pyle, the film premiered two months to the day after he was killed in action on Ie Shima during the invasion of Okinawa. In his February 14, 1945, posting entitled \"In the Movies\", Pyle commented: \"They are still calling it \"The Story of G.I. Joe\".

She is identified in some historical references as \"the most important female director the American film industry has known\", and among \"the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films\". Film historian Anthony Slide has also asserted, \"Along with D.W.Griffith, Weber was the American cinema's first genuine auteur, a filmmaker involved in all aspects of production and one who utilized the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies\". Weber produced a body of work which has been compared to Griffith's in both quantity and quality and brought to the screen her concerns for humanity and social justice in an estimated 200 to 400 films, of which as few as twenty have been preserved. She has been credited by IMDb with directing 135 films, writing 114, and acting in 100. Weber was \"one of the first directors to come to the attention of the censors in Hollywood's early years\". Weber has been credited with pioneering the use of the split screen technique to show simultaneous action in her 1913 film \"Suspense\". In collaboration with her first husband, Phillips Smalley, in 1913 Weber was \"one of the first directors to experiment with sound\", making the first sound films in the United States. She was also the first American woman to direct a full-length feature film when she and Smalley directed \"The Merchant of Venice\" in 1914, and in 1917 the first American woman director to own her own film studio. During the war years, Weber \"achieved tremendous success by combining a canny commercial sense with a rare vision of cinema as a moral tool\". At her zenith, \"few men, before or since, have retained such absolute control over the films they have directedand certainly no women directors have achieved the all-embracing, powerful status once held by Lois Weber\". By 1920, Weber was considered the \"premier woman director of the screen and author and producer of the biggest money making features in the history of the film business\". Among Weber's notable films are: the controversial \"Hypocrites\", which featured the first full-frontal female nude scene, in 1915; the 1916 film \" Where Are My Children?\", which discussed abortion and birth control and was added to the National Film Registry in 1993; her adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's \"Tarzan of the Apes\" novel for the very first \"Tarzan of the Apes\" film, in 1918; and what is often considered her masterpiece, \"The Blot\", in 1921. Weber is credited with discovering, mentoring, or making stars of several women actors, including Mary MacLaren, Mildred Harris, Claire Windsor, Esther Ralston, Billie Dove, Ella Hall, Cleo Ridgely, and Anita Stewart, and with discovering and inspiring screenwriter Frances Marion. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Weber was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960.\nDocument[3](Title: The Secret of Santa Maria) The Secret of Santa Maria( German: Das Geheimnis der Santa Maria) is a 1921 German silent film directed by Lothar Mendes.

He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger. He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour. Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness. He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride. Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything. His love interests are Alamelu (Aarathi) and Margaret (Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life. The conversations between the Guru (Chamayya) and Shishya (Ramachari) is the highlight of movie all through. Chamayya and Ramachari have differences of opinion over what is right and wrong. Chamayya is more willing to blend in with the society than Ramachari and this usually ends in an argument between the two. It is possible that the society is the silent rhetoric for the title of the movie which spreads venom \u2014 a cobra. The movie was remade in Hindi as \"Zehreela Insaan\" , in Tamil as \"Raja Nagam\" and in Telugu as \"Kode Nagu \". The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018.

The screenplay was by Paul Schrader, from a story by De Palma and Schrader. Bernard Herrmann provided the film's soundtrack prior to his death in 1975. The story is about a New Orleans businessman who is haunted by guilt following the death of his wife and daughter during a kidnapping- rescue attempt gone wrong. Years after the tragedy, he meets and falls in love with a young woman who is the exact look- alike of his long dead wife. Both De Palma and Schrader have pointed to Alfred Hitchcock's\" Vertigo\"( 1958) as the major inspiration for\" Obsession\"'s narrative and thematic concerns. Schrader's script was extensively rewritten and pared down by De Palma prior to shooting, causing the screenwriter to proclaim a complete lack of interest in the film's subsequent production and release. Completed in 1975, Columbia Pictures picked up the distribution rights but demanded that minor changes be made to reduce potentially controversial aspects of the plot. When finally released in the late summer of 1976, it became De Palma's first substantial box office success and received a mixed response from critics.\nDocument[2](Title: His Jazz Bride) His Jazz Bride is a 1926 American silent drama film released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

It is perhaps best known for starting the\" cannibal boom\" of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Lenzi was probably trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema, which had gained considerable Grindhouse popularity since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara made\" Mondo Cane\" in 1962, even though this film is fictional. Like\" Man from Deep River\", Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations, graphic violence, and animal cruelty. The film was mainly inspired by\" A Man Called Horse\", which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive. The title\" Man from Deep River\" is even supposed to echo the title\" A Man Called Horse\".\nDocument[3](Title: Charles Boyer) Charles Boyer( 28 August 1899 \u2013 26 August 1978) was a French- American actor who appeared in more than 80 films between 1920 and 1976.

We have known him from a colophon in the Serbian recension of the Slavonic Josephus,\" The History of the Jewish War\". He transcribed and translated the Slavonic Josephus into Serbian vernacular at Karyes, the administrative center of Mount Athos, in 1585. In addition, the Hilandar Monastery has preserved five petitions that hieromonk Grigorije in his frequent travels throughout Europe delivered to nobleman Nikita Romanov( the grandfather of the future tsar Michael of Russia) in April 1586; Andrej Jakovlevi\u0107( two petitions written before 1582); Polish king Stephen Bathory; and Duke Andrey Kurbsky. Also, these documents have been published by the Moscow Main Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. According to records Grigorije Vasilije served as abbot of Hilandar in 1583, and multiple other occasions between 1588 and 1591 and continually from 1591 to 1598. He also traveled between the far- flung Athonite methos( including Imperial Russia) and their parent establishments on regular errands as alms collecting, property administration and Diplomatic missions on behalf of the secular and spiritual leaders where he stayed at the Moscow courts of Ivan the Terrible and Dionysius, Metropolitan of Moscow and their successors Fedor I of Russia and Patriarch Job of Moscow, years later. Upon his return voyage, Grogorije Vasilije traveled to Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in Ottoman- occupied Serbia to see his master Gerasim I and later the patriarch's successor Savatije I before resuming his trip back to Karyes, Mount Athos. Ivan the Terrible's generosity shown to Serbian itinerant monk Grigorije and other Athonite monks accompanying him could be explained by the tsar \u2019s own recognition of his Serbian royal lineage( through his mother) and the desire to strengthen relations between Russia and Serbia. Author Sreten Petkovi\u0107 in\" The Cultural Heritage of Serbia\" attributes the presence of the 1564 fresco of Prince Lazar of Serbia in the Cathedral of the Archangel of the Moscow Kremlin to Tsar Ivan \u2019s attachment to his Serbian roots.

In 1702 the latter was transferred to the chair of medicine at Leiden University, and it was there that Bernhard Siegfried began his studies in 1709, at the age of 12, having for his teachers such men as Boerhaave and Nikolaus Bidloo. Having finished his studies at Leiden, he went to Paris, where, under the instruction of S\u00e9bastien Vaillant( 1669 \u2013 1722), Jacob Winslow( 1669 \u2013 1760) and others, he devoted himself especially to anatomy and botany. After a year's absence he was, on the recommendation of Boerhaave, recalled in 1719 to Leiden to be a lecturer on anatomy and surgery. Two years later he succeeded his father in the professorship of these subjects, and speedily became one of the most famous teachers of anatomy in Europe, his classroom being resorted to not only by students but by many practising physicians. In 1745 Albinus was appointed professor of the practice of medicine, being succeeded in the anatomical chair by his brother Frederick Bernhard( 1715 \u2013 1778), who, as well as another brother, Christian Bernhard( 1700 \u2013 1752), attained considerable distinction. Bernhard Siegfried, who was twice rector of his university, died at Leiden. Albinus is perhaps best known for his monumental\" Tabulae sceleti et musculorum corporis humani\", which was first published in Leiden in 1747, largely at his own expense. The artist and engraver with whom Albinus did nearly all of his work was Jan Wandelaar( 1690 \u2013 1759). In an attempt to increase the scientific accuracy of anatomical illustration, Albinus and Wandelaar devised a new technique of placing nets with square webbing at specified intervals between the artist and the anatomical specimen and copying the images using the grid patterns. \" Tabulae\" was highly criticized by such scholars as Petrus Camper, especially for the whimsical backgrounds added to many of the pieces by Wandelaar, but Albinus staunchly defended Wandelaar.\nDocument[3](Title: Sextus Cocceius Vibianus) Sextus Cocceius Vibianus was a Roman Senator in 204.

He was nominated in the same category the following year for \"The Last of the Mohicans\". Born in Bloomfield, Iowa, Beauchamp was one of two sons of Charles and Ula Beauchamp. His father was a druggist. The family later moved to Denver, Colorado and then to Fort Worth, Texas. After his parents divorced, his mother took her sons to Los Angeles, California where Beauchamp started working in motion pictures at age 16 as a stuntman. His first known film is \"Stupid, But Brave\". He would later appear in \"The Painted Desert\", sharing screen time with Clark Gable and William Boyd. In 1933, he appeared in the W.C. Fields comedy \"International House\", in a non-credited part as a newsreel cameraman. From 1926 to 1930, Beauchamp was married to actress and comedian Anita Garvin, who is best remembered for the 11 films she made with comedians Laurel and Hardy. In 1935, he married script girl Sydney Hein. He went on to work on several Tarzan and Dick Tracy movies, eventually becoming a production manager. In this capacity, he worked on such films as Fred Zinnemann's \"The Men\" (1950) and \"High Noon\" (1952), \"Death of a Salesman\" (1951) and most of Stanley Kramer's best work, including \"The Defiant Ones\" (1958), \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961) and \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963).

He initially fought against the Romans during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War as head of Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in 67 CE to Roman forces led by Vespasian after the six-week siege of Jotapata. Josephus claimed the Jewish Messianic prophecies that initiated the First Roman-Jewish War made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. In response Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius. Flavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator when Titus led the Siege of Jerusalem. Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the city's destruction and the looting and destruction of Herod's Temple (Second Temple) soon followed. Josephus recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish\u2013Roman War (66\u201370 CE), including the Siege of Masada. His most important works were \"The Jewish War\" (75) and \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (94). \" The Jewish War\" recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. \" Antiquities of the Jews\" recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity, although not specifically mentioned by Josephus. Josephus' works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Palestine.\nDocument[3](Title: Constantine the Great) Constantine the Great (27 February AD 272 \u2013 22 May AD 337), also known as Constantine I, was a Roman Emperor who ruled between AD 306 and 337. Born in Naissus, in Dacia Ripensis, the city now known as Ni\u0161 (located in Serbia), he was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer of Illyrian origins. His mother, Helena, was Greek. His father became \"Caesar\", the deputy emperor in the west, in AD 293. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under Emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \"Augustus\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in AD 306. He emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by AD 324 . As emperor, Constantine enacted administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire. He restructured the government, separating civil and military authorities. To combat inflation he introduced the solidus, a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years. The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers\u2014the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians\u2014even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. Although he lived much of his life as a pagan, and later as a catechumen, he joined the Christian faith on his deathbed, being baptised by Eusebius of Nicomedia. He played an influential role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, which produced the statement of Christian belief known as the Nicene Creed. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on his orders at the purported site of Jesus' tomb in Jerusalem and became the holiest place in Christendom. The Papal claim to temporal power in the High Middle Ages was based on the forged Donation of Constantine. He has historically been referred to as the \"First Christian Emperor\", and he did heavily promote the Christian Church. Some modern scholars, however, debate his beliefs and even his comprehension of the Christian faith itself. The age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the Roman Empire. He built a new imperial residence at Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople (now Istanbul) after himself (the laudatory epithet of \"New Rome\" came later, and was never an official title). It became the capital of the Empire for more than a thousand years, with the later eastern Roman Empire, now being referred to as the Byzantine Empire by historians. His more immediate political legacy was that he replaced Diocletian's tetrarchy with the principle of dynastic succession by leaving the empire to his sons. His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and for centuries after his reign. The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue, while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity. Beginning with the Renaissance, there were more critical appraisals of his reign, due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources. Trends in modern and recent scholarship have attempted to balance the extremes of previous scholarship.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, Jo\u00e3o De Aquino or Yacine Slatni?": [

The film is a hybrid documentary and fictional narrative. Documentary segments include traditional talking-head clips from musicians, writers, and social critics, as well as archival video footage and photographs. Described as \"A truly masterful film essay about Black aesthetics that traces the deployments of science fiction within pan-African culture\", it has also been called \"one of the most influential video-essays of the 1990s, influencing filmmakers and inspiring conferences, novels and exhibitions\". The fictional story follows the journey of the \"data thief\" who must travel across time and space in search of a crossroads where he makes archaeological digs for fragments of history and technology in search of the code that holds the key to his future. The structure of the film makes it a meta-narrative commenting on while also becoming part of the genre of Afrofuturism. The film uses concepts based on George Clinton's Mothership Connection and features interviews with Clinton, Derrick May, Samuel R. Delany, Nichelle Nichols, Juan Atkins, DJ Spooky, Goldie, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Kodwo Eshun and others to explore the link between black music as a way of exploring the future. The film makes mention of Sun Ra, whose work centres on the return of blacks to outer space in his own Mothership. \"The Last Angel of History\" emphasizes black musical traditions. The film argues that the drum, which could \"communicate both across the African diaspora and across time,\" was the \"first Afrofuturistic technology. \" In \"Further Considerations on Afrofuturism,\" Eshun says of the film: The Last Angel of History\" remains the most elaborate exposition on the convergence of ideas that is Afrofuturism. Through the persona of a time-traveling nomadic figure known as the Data Thief, \"The Last Angel of History\" created a network of links between music, space, futurology, and diaspora. \" The film forges links between, for example, spirituals, P-Funk, and techno.\nDocument[2](Title: Jeremy Kagan) Jeremy Paul Kagan (born December 14, 1945) is an American film and television director, screenwriter, and television producer.\nDocument[3](Title: Marisabel Lomba) Marie- Isabelle\" Marisabel\" Lomba( born 17 August 1974) is a Belgian judoka and Olympic medalist.

Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and dramatized by Guy Trosper from a story written by Nedrick Young, the film is about a young man sentenced to prison for manslaughter who is mentored in music by his prison cellmate who realizes his musical abilities. After his release from jail, while looking for a job as a club singer, the young man meets a musical promoter who helps him launch his career. As he develops his musical abilities and becomes a star, his self-centered personality begins to affect his relationships. The wife of producer Pandro S. Berman convinced him to create a film with Presley in the role. Berman delegated the casting to Benny Thau, head of the studio and Abraham Lastfogel, the then president of William Morris Agency. Berman hired Richard Thorpe, who was known for shooting productions quickly. The production of \"Jailhouse Rock\" began on May 13, 1957, and concluded on June 17 of that year. The dance sequence to the film's title song \"Jailhouse Rock\" is often cited as \"Presley's greatest moment on screen\". Before pre-production began, songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber were commissioned to integrate the film's soundtrack. In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show the progress of the repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted in a hotel room by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room door with a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics. \"Jailhouse Rock\" premiered on October 17, 1957 in Memphis, Tennessee and was released nationwide on November 8, 1957. It peaked at number 3 on the \"Variety\" box office chart, and reached number 14 in the year's box office totals, grossing $4 million. \" Jailhouse Rock\" earned mixed reviews, with most of the negative reception directed towards Presley's persona. In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry and was deemed \"culturally, aesthetically or historically significant.\" On its January 28, 2019 edition, the Ultimate Classic Rock website named it the best rock movie of 1957.\n\nQuestion: Where does the director of film Shock Treatment (1964 Film) work at?": [

The eighth film in the \"James Bond\" series to be produced by Eon Productions, it was the first to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, and was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Although the producers had wanted Sean Connery to return after his role in the previous Bond film \" Diamonds Are Forever\", he declined, sparking a search for a new actor to play Bond; Moore was signed for the lead role. In the film, a Harlem drug lord known as Mr. Big plans to distribute two tons of heroin for free to put rival drug barons out of business and then become a monopoly supplier. Mr. Big is revealed to be the alter ego of Dr. Kananga, a corrupt Caribbean dictator, who rules San Monique, a fictional island where opium poppies are secretly farmed. Bond is investigating the deaths of three British agents, leading him to Kananga, and is soon trapped in a world of gangsters and voodoo as he fights to put a stop to the drug baron's scheme. \"Live and Let Die\" was released during the height of the blaxploitation era, and many blaxploitation archetypes and clich\u00e9s are depicted in the film, including derogatory racial epithets (\"honky\"), black gangsters, and pimpmobiles. It departs from the former plots of the James Bond films about megalomaniac super-villains, and instead focuses on drug trafficking, a common theme of blaxploitation films of the period. It is set in African American cultural centres such as Harlem and New Orleans, as well as the Caribbean Islands. It was also the first James Bond film featuring an African American Bond girl romantically involved with 007, Rosie Carver, who was played by Gloria Hendry.

As a feature film director, he is likely best known for\" The Thing from Another World\"( 1951).

We have known him from a colophon in the Serbian recension of the Slavonic Josephus,\" The History of the Jewish War\". He transcribed and translated the Slavonic Josephus into Serbian vernacular at Karyes, the administrative center of Mount Athos, in 1585. In addition, the Hilandar Monastery has preserved five petitions that hieromonk Grigorije in his frequent travels throughout Europe delivered to nobleman Nikita Romanov( the grandfather of the future tsar Michael of Russia) in April 1586; Andrej Jakovlevi\u0107( two petitions written before 1582); Polish king Stephen Bathory; and Duke Andrey Kurbsky. Also, these documents have been published by the Moscow Main Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. According to records Grigorije Vasilije served as abbot of Hilandar in 1583, and multiple other occasions between 1588 and 1591 and continually from 1591 to 1598. He also traveled between the far- flung Athonite methos( including Imperial Russia) and their parent establishments on regular errands as alms collecting, property administration and Diplomatic missions on behalf of the secular and spiritual leaders where he stayed at the Moscow courts of Ivan the Terrible and Dionysius, Metropolitan of Moscow and their successors Fedor I of Russia and Patriarch Job of Moscow, years later. Upon his return voyage, Grogorije Vasilije traveled to Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in Ottoman- occupied Serbia to see his master Gerasim I and later the patriarch's successor Savatije I before resuming his trip back to Karyes, Mount Athos. Ivan the Terrible's generosity shown to Serbian itinerant monk Grigorije and other Athonite monks accompanying him could be explained by the tsar \u2019s own recognition of his Serbian royal lineage( through his mother) and the desire to strengthen relations between Russia and Serbia. Author Sreten Petkovi\u0107 in\" The Cultural Heritage of Serbia\" attributes the presence of the 1564 fresco of Prince Lazar of Serbia in the Cathedral of the Archangel of the Moscow Kremlin to Tsar Ivan \u2019s attachment to his Serbian roots. Additionally, the Church of the Archangel Michael contains depictions of Saint Sava, Saint Simeon, and the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaeologos.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Damo (Philosopher)'s father?": [

Along with Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Pedro Almod\u00f3var, he is counted among the Spain\u2019s three most renowned filmmakers. He has a long and prolific career that spans over half a century. Several of his films have won many international awards. Saura began his career in 1955 making documentary shorts. He quickly gained international prominence when his first feature-length film premiered at Cannes Film Festival in 1960. Although he started filming as a neorealist, Saura quickly switched to films encoded with metaphors and symbolism in order to get around the Spanish censors. In 1966, he was thrust into the international spotlight when his film \"La Caza\" won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In the following years, he forged an international reputation for his cinematic treatment of emotional and spiritual responses to repressive political conditions. By the 1970s, Saura was the best known filmmaker working in Spain. His films employed complex narrative devices and were frequently controversial. He won Special Jury Awards for \"La Prima Ang\u00e9lica\" (1973) and \"Cr\u00eda Cuervos\" (1975) in Cannes; and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film nomination in 1979 for \"Mama Cumple 100 A\u00f1os\". In the 1980s, Saura was in the spotlight for his Flamenco trilogy \u2013 \"Bodas de SangreCarmen\" and \"El Amor Brujo,\" in which he combined dramatic content and flamenco dance forms. His work continued to be featured in worldwide competitions and earned numerous awards. He received two nominations for Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, for \"Carmen\" (1983) and \"Tango\" (1998). His films are sophisticated expression of time and space fusing reality with fantasy, past with present, and memory with hallucination. In the last two decades of the 20th century, Saura has concentrated on works uniting music, dance and images.\nDocument[3](Title: Miguel Contreras Torres) Miguel Contreras Torres (September 28, 1899- June 5, 1981) was a Mexican-born actor, screenwriter, film producer and director.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who is older, Shootin' For Love or The Other Life Of Captain Contreras?": [

It is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's 1929 Bengali novel of the same name and is Ray's directorial debut. It features Subir Banerjee, Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Uma Dasgupta and Chunibala Devi. The first film in\" The Apu Trilogy Pather Panchali\" depicts the childhood of the protagonist Apu( Subir Banerjee) and his elder sister Durga( Uma Dasgupta) and the harsh village life of their poor family. Production was interrupted because of funding problems and it took nearly three years for the film to be completed. The film was shot mainly on location, had a limited budget, featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew. The sitar player Ravi Shankar composed the film's soundtrack and score using classical Indian ragas. Subrata Mitra was in charge of the cinematography while editing was handled by Dulal Dutta. Following its premiere on 3 May 1955 during an exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art,\" Pather Panchali\" was released in Calcutta later the same year to an enthusiastic reception. A special screening was attended by the Chief Minister of West Bengal and the Prime Minister of India. Critics have praised its realism, humanity, and soul- stirring qualities while others have called its slow pace a drawback, and some have condemned it for romanticising poverty. Scholars have commented on the film's lyrical quality and realism( influenced by Italian neorealism), its portrayal of the poverty and small delights of daily life, and the use of what the author Darius Cooper has termed the\" epiphany of wonder\", among other themes. The tale of Apu's life is continued in the two subsequent installments of Ray's trilogy:\" Aparajito The Unvanquished\", 1956) and\" Apur Sansar The World of Apu\", 1959). \" Pather Panchali\" is described as a turning point in Indian cinema, as it was among the films that pioneered the Parallel Cinema movement, which espoused authenticity and social realism. The first film from independent India to attract major international critical attention, it won India's National Film Award for Best Feature Film in 1955, the Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, and several other awards, establishing Ray as one of the country's most distinguished filmmakers.

In 1941, he won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the film\" The Great McGinty\", his first of three nominations in the category. Sturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It is not uncommon for a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. Prior to Sturges, other figures in Hollywood( such as Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts, however Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to establish success as a screenwriter and then move into directing his own scripts, at a time when those roles were separate. Sturges famously sold the story for\" The Great McGinty\" to Paramount Pictures for$ 1, in return for being allowed to direct the film.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born later, Gene Autry And The Mounties or Sunday'S Illness?": [

She was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade long career. She was often introduced as \"the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page\". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as \"A Page in my life called Patti\". Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's \"Confess\". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single \" With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\", and would eventually have 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965. Page's signature song, \"Tennessee Waltz\", was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the \"Billboard magazine's Best-Sellers List\" in 1950/51. Page had three additional No. 1 hit singles between 1950 and 1953, \"All My Love (Bolero)I Went to Your Wedding\", and \"(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window\". Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the \"Billboard\" Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades. With the rise of Rock and Roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with \"Old Cape CodAllegheny MoonA Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)\", and \"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\". In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.

The plot involves a gang of land- grabbers who try to prevent safe passage of the Foster Stage Company through frontier territory, however, the story of the serial is merely a framework for the setup of numerous elaborate stunt action sequences, cliff- hanging perils and fiery deathtraps which the hero and heroine must fight to survive. As was the case with other Republic serials released during wartime such as\" King of the Mounties\" and\" The Masked Marvel\", a rapid, even frantic pace is evident throughout, which has made the serial a favorite among fans. Both Native American actors who played the Lone Ranger's companion Tonto, Chief Thunder Cloud( of the 1930s\" Lone Ranger\" movie serials) and Jay Silverheels( of 1950s\" Lone Ranger\" television program) appear in the sequence in which Kay Aldridge and Eddie Acuff are held hostage by Indians. The serial was long considered to be a partially lost film; for years, copies of only chapters 2, 4, 5, and 12 circulated on 16 mm among film collectors. The entire serial, however, was never fully\" lost,\" it was simply never re-released to theaters, or released on video because 5 reels of sound from the archival material apparently went missing not long after the serial's original exhibition. The absence of these reels may be the reason why Republic Pictures had no objection to subsequently selling off an incomplete print of the serial to cowboy actor William\" Hopalong Cassidy\" Boyd for use as stock footage.

She was a concubine of Murong Bao( Emperor Huimin) and the mother of Murong Sheng( Emperor Zhaowu). She gave birth to Murong Sheng while Murong Bao was serving as a low- level Former Qin official, in 373. What happened to her during the next three decades were not clear, but at the time when Murong Bao, then emperor of Later Yan, and Murong Sheng were fleeing from rebellions in 398, she was at the capital Longcheng( \u9f8d\u57ce, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). At this time, she was carefully served by her daughter- in- law Princess Lan, despite the fact that Longcheng was under the control of Princess Lan's father Lan Han, who would set a trap for Murong Bao and have him killed later that year, and then claim the throne. Murong Sheng was spared, however, because he was Lan Han's son-in- law, and he soon overthrew Lan Han in a coup and reestablished Later Yan as its emperor. He did not initially honor her as empress dowager, as that honor belonged to Murong Bao's wife Empress Duan, but he did honor her with the title Empress Xianzhuang. After Empress Dowager Duan died in 400, he honored her as empress dowager. Because of how Princess Lan protected both her and Murong Sheng, when Murong Sheng considered executing her as the daughter of a traitor, Empress Dowager Ding greatly opposed it, and Princess Lan was spared, although she would never be empress. Sometime during Murong Sheng's reign, Empress Dowager Ding started an affair with Murong Bao's younger brother, Murong Xi the Duke of Hejian \u2014 who was 12 years her son Murong Sheng's junior. After Murong Sheng was assassinated in a failed coup attempt in 401, she therefore forced the officials to bypass both Murong Sheng's son, Murong Ding( \u6155\u5bb9\u5b9a) the Crown Prince, and Murong Sheng's younger brother Murong Yuan( \u6155\u5bb9\u5143) the Duke of Pingyuan, whom most officials favored. Empress Dowager Ding's affair with Murong Xi continued. However, in 402, Murong Xi took two daughters of the official Fu Mo( \u82fb\u8b28) -- Fu Song'e and Fu Xunying as concubines, and favored them greatly \u2014 particularly Fu Xunying. By comparison, his affair with Empress Dowager Ding cooled off, and she became angry. She plotted with her nephew Ding Xin( \u4e01\u4fe1) to depose Murong Xi and replace him with another younger brother of her son, Murong Yuan( \u6155\u5bb9\u6df5, note different character than his brother) the Duke of Zhangwu. The plot was discovered, and Murong Xi executed Ding Xin and Murong Yuan and forced Empress Dowager Ding to commit suicide, but still buried her with honors due an empress.\n\nQuestion: Are Ding Yaping and Johann Christian Gustav Lucae of the same nationality?": [

The music is by George Gershwin, with lyrics by his brother Ira, with additional music by Saul Chaplin, the music director. The story of the film is interspersed with dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and set to Gershwin's music. MGM executive Arthur Freed bought the Gershwin musical catalog from George's brother Ira in the late 1940s, since George died in 1937. Some of the tunes in this catalog were included in the movie, such as\" I Got Rhythm\" and\" Love Is Here to Stay\". Other songs in the movie include\" I'll Build A Stairway to Paradise\" and'S Wonderful\". The climax of the film is\" The American in Paris\" ballet, a 17- minute dance featuring Kelly and Caron set to Gershwin's\" An American in Paris\". The ballet sequence cost almost half a million dollars to shoot. It was filmed on 44 sets in MGM's back lot. \" An American in Paris\" was an enormous success, garnering eight Academy Award nominations and winning six, as well as earning other industry honors. In 1993, it was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress in the National Film Registry for being\" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

The members of the band are Arthur Buezo( guitar, vocals), Christian Cardiello( bass), James Ford( banjo, vocals), and Eric Munley,( mandolin, vocals). When the band formed, their ages ranged from 20 to 22. None of them were planning to have a music career until they met at Paul Smith's College in the Adirondacks. The band got its name from an incident that occurred at Paul Smith's College. They had just finished playing a song, when a saw- whet owl flew into a window. The owl got up and just stared at them for a minute, then flew away. A saw- whet is also called a\" blind owl,\" and so the band was named. The band has been described as having an early 70's look( long hair, heavily bearded) and compared to New Grass Revival. Their music has been described as\" bluegrass with teeth.\" The band prefers the term\" original string music.\" According to Munley, the term\" bluegrass\" is associated with rules and techniques that Blind Owl's music does n't follow. Their music combines many genres with a strong traditional string music and bluegrass base. The band's influences include the Allman Brothers, Bob Dylan, Jaco Pastorius, The Whompers, classical and flamenco guitar. They play so furiously that they frequently snap strings. The band's first album was released in January 2012. It is titled\" Rabble Rousing\"( 2012). The 13- track CD, was recorded by Larry Dolan at Granary Studio in Morrisonville, New York. According to the Adirondack Daily Enterprise,\" The young band had been together less than a year when it made its first album,\" Rabble Rousing,\" which sounded as raucous as its title implied. It was recorded live, with everyone playing together, and it sounded like their shows: a throbbing mass, a huge\" chunka- chunka- chunka\" punctuated by Buezo's deep growl and Ford's high yowl. They trade leads to break it up a bit, but there's little emphasis on solos. They play as one but not bluegrass- tight- rather like a racing stagecoach with slack in the reins. They're all heart and gut and energy, playing the music of hobos, tramps, trail crews, river rafting guides and forestry students.\" According to Upstate Live,\" The band's second album was released in July of 2013. It is titled\" This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel.\" As original as the title, The Blind Owl Band presents their sophomore disc. A distinct set of vocal accompaniment would have one wondering if Tom Waits dropped in( he did n\u2019t) for a batch of fiery bluegrass and dirty jams. Using traditional instrumentation, Arthur Buezo( guitar, vocals), Eric Munley( mandolin, vocals), James Ford( banjo, vocals) and Christian Cardiello( bass), all transplants to Saranac Lake, NY, draw upon their youthful influences mostly defined by their fathers \u2019 flare for the good stuff. This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel is a testament to their past whilst forging a path where their sound is becoming uniquely their own.\" According to Upstate Live,\" \u201c Sailor Song, \u201d whether intentional or not, exemplifies the magical undercurrent of the past popping up in today \u2019s music. The disc intro gives a nod to a \u201c House of the Rising Sun \u201d look alike, but only for a few seconds. From this point forward, the disc launches into a fun-filled, fast- paced, barnburner, ho- down of a good time. They give a breather by slowing it down in \u201c Missing My Home, \u201d where Eastbound Jesus \u2019, \u201c Holy Smokes! \u201d is given accolades. A bass solo introduces \u201c Jazzy McGee, \u201d in a tune that sounds just like its title. A neat little contrast in The Blind Owl Band is the depth of the tenor and bass vocals and the high- pitched use of the mandolin, where a balance is met and the band is defined. Between their first album and their submission to Couch by Couchwest, the Blind Owl Band was beginning to make a name for themselves as a rowdy, footloose bunch. Imagine my surprise when their sophomore album opened with a somber tune called\" Sailor's Song.\" It sets the tone for the rest of the album\u2014hard- driving and determined. That's not to say that the Owls have lost their sense of fun. There are plenty of boot -stompers on here. To the contrary, the Blind Owl Band is showing off their newfound maturity. But unlike other bands who create morose second albums to show off their Depth, the Blind Owl Band is simply devoting their manic energy in another direction. They still pick like it's their job, and they still sound like they've just arrived from the depths of Appalachia.\" Since 2011 the band has played over 200 shows. They have played with Trampled By Turtles, Railroad Earth, Hot Day at The Zoo, Floodwood, Jatoba, Driftwood, Cabinet, Lucid, Big Leg Emma, The Bloodroots Barter, Gold Town, Eastbound Jesus, and The Mallett Brothers.

He was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including \"City for Conquest\" (1940). Noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), and \"East of Eden\" (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar. His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\", one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. \" A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", which introduced James Dean to movie audiences. A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong. \" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event. Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses. \" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous. \" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film \"A Letter to Elia\" as a personal tribute to Kazan.\nDocument[2](Title: Broadway or Bust) Broadway or Bust is a lost 1924 silent film western romantic comedy directed by Edward Sedgwick and starring Hoot Gibson.

He is the youngest child and only son of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His father died on 26 January 1947 in an airplane crash in Denmark when Carl Gustaf was nine months old. Upon his father's death, he became second in line to the throne, after his grandfather, the then Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. Following the death of his great-grandfather King Gustaf V in 1950, Gustaf Adolf ascended the throne and thus Carl Gustaf became Sweden's new crown prince and heir apparent to the throne at the age of four. A short while after he became king in 1973, the new 1974 Instrument of Government took effect, formally stripping Carl XVI Gustaf of any role in the legislative process, and several other duties normally accorded to a head of state, such as the formal appointment of the prime minister, signing off legislation, and being commander-in-chief of the nation's military. The new instrument explicitly limits the king to ceremonial functions and, among other things, to be regularly informed of affairs of state. As head of the House of Bernadotte Carl Gustaf has also been able to make a number of government-supported decisions about the titles and positions of its members. The king's heir apparent, after passage on 1 January 1980 of a new law establishing absolute primogeniture (the first such law passed in European history), is Crown Princess Victoria, the eldest child of the King and his wife, Queen Silvia. Before the passage of that law, Crown Princess Victoria's younger brother, Prince Carl Philip, was briefly the heir apparent, as of his birth in May 1979. Carl XVI Gustaf is the longest-reigning monarch in Swedish history, having surpassed King Magnus IV's reign of 44 years and 222 days on 26 April 2018.\n\nQuestion: Where did Carlos Bee's father die?": [

Born in Rome, he was the son of Ricciarda Malaspina, duchess of Massa and Carrara and Lorenzo Cybo, duke of Ferentillo who changed his name to Cybo-Malaspina, and a great-grandson of Pope Innocent VIII. His mother was the heir of the state of Massa and Carrara, which she had inherited from her father. In 1546, he challenged his mother for control of the duchy of Massa and Carrara. With the backing of Cosimo I de' Medici and Andrea Doria, he seized control by force in 1546. Soon after, his mother appealed to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Charles sent his forces to seize Massa while Giulio was away. In March 1546, Giulio married Peretta Doria (1526\u20131591), daughter of Tommaso and sister of Giannettino Doria. Giulio had been promised a large dowry, which he wanted to fund a return to power, but Andrea Doria refused, arguing that he'd already spent more than the dowry on Giulio's first attempt to seize the Duchy. At that time Andrea Doria was a Genoese admiral in the service of Emperor and King of Spain Charles V (with whom the petty Massese state had allied so far). After Doria refused to fund him, Giulio set a plot against him together with Ottobuono Fieschi, Ottobuono Fieschi and other Genoese refugees, also backed by the Strozzi family of Florence and Pope Paul III. The aim was to enter the city and kill Doria, the Spanish ambassador and other members of the Doria party. With the help of the pope and Piero Strozzi, the revolt should spread to the whole Italy, with the objective to expel the Spaniards from the country. The plot was discovered before its beginning and Cybo was arrested in Pontremoli. Despite an attempt to save him from his cousin Cosimo I of Tuscany, he was beheaded in Milan in May 1548. His body was buried in the Cathedral of Massa. At his mother's death in 1553, the states of Massa and Carrara were ultimately inherited by his brother Alberico I Cybo-Malaspina, Prince of Massa.\nDocument[3](Title: Catilina Aubameyang) Catilina Aubameyang (born 1 September 1983 in Libreville) is a retired former Gabonese international footballer who played as a left-winger.

He was born in Vordingborg, Denmark. The Heiberg ancestry can be traced back to Norway, and has produced a long line of priests, headmasters and other learned men. Peter Andreas Heibergs father was the Norwegian-born headmaster of the grammar school in Vordingborg, Ludvig Heiberg, while his mother was Inger Margrethe, daughter of the vicar at the manor of Vemmetofte Peder Heiberg, a relative of Ludvig Heiberg, and Inger H\u00f8rning, who came from a family of wealthy Danish merchants. His father died when Heiberg was just two years old, and his mother moved with the children to live with her father at Vemmetofte near the town of Faxe in Zealand. This was to be Heiberg's home until he went to grammar school, from which he graduated in 1774. In 1777 he took the greater philological exam, and in 1779 he left Copenhagen, presumably due to gambling debts. He then went to Sweden to join the Swedish military forces. One and a half years later, his family bought him out of his military service, and after a short stay in Uppsala, he went to Bergen, where he stayed with his uncle for three years. In Bergen Heiberg met several writers who inspired him to start writing himself. After his return to Copenhagen, he used his linguistic skills to get a job as an interpreter. Heiberg also translated a publication by the French writer Jean-Charles Laveaux, which was highly critical towards the upper class, this was likely the reason why Heiberg chose to publish the translated version anonymously. In 1790, Heiberg married the 16-year-old Thomasine Buntzen with whom he has the son Johan Ludvig. Many of Heiberg's role models were French and usually marked by the ideals of the Enlightenment. His d\u00e9but novel \"Rigsdalersedlens H\u00e6ndelser\" (1789) critically describes merchants, the nobility and the German influence on Denmark. This novel highly angered the Danish upper class, but Heiberg kept writing similarly critical songs, articles, essays and plays (one play, \"Heckingborn\", being translated into English in 1799 with the title \"Poverty and Wealth\"). This political criticism led to Heiberg being banished on Christmas Eve, 1799. He had previously been given many warnings and fines for his works full of criticism of the government, but after new, harsher censorship laws were introduced by the crown prince Frederick in September 1799 he was accused and sentenced retroactively to banishment. Thereafter, Heiberg settled in Paris where he lived until his death in 1841. About his life in Paris, see \"Encyclop\u00e9die des gens du monde\", vol. 13, p. 594.\nDocument[2](Title: Edith Baumann) Edith Baumann (1 August 1909 \u2013 7 April 1973) was an East German politician.

Melchior Zobel von Giebelstadt was born in 1502, the son of Georg Zobel and his wife Dorothea R\u00fcdt von Callenberg. As a younger son, he was groomed for a career in the church from an early age. He became a canon(\" Domizellar\") of W\u00fcrzburg Cathedral on 27 January 1521. He studied at the University of Wittenberg in summer semester 1521. He spent winter semester 1521 studying at the University of Leipzig. He became a\" Domherr\" of W\u00fcrzburg Cathedral in 1522. On 4 March 1540 he was elected dean of W\u00fcrzburg Cathedral and was subsequently ordained as a priest. Following the death of Bishop Konrad von Th\u00fcngen, Zobel von Giebelstadt was a candidate to replace him as Prince- Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, but he lost the election, held on 1 July 1540, to Conrad von Bibra. On 19 August 1544 the cathedral chapter of W\u00fcrzburg Cathedral elected him as the new Prince- Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg. A delegation from the cathedral chapter informed Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor of his election on 22 August 1544 and Pope Paul III confirmed his appointment on 27 October 1544. During the Schmalkaldic War of 1546- 47, he allied the Prince- Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg with the pro-Catholic imperial forces. That war ended when the Diet of Augsburg of 1547- 48 declared the Augsburg Interim. Zobel von Giebelstadt's opposition to the Augsburg Interim led to him and six other prelates being personally rebuked by Charles V at an audience held on 9 April 1548. As bishop, Zobel von Giebelstadt was fiercely opposed to the efforts of Friedrich Bernbeck( 1511 \u201370), mayor of Kitzingen to introduce the Reformation in Kitzingen. He attempted to found a Jesuit university in 1556, but this effort failed as the order was unable to provide a sufficient number of priests to staff the proposed university.\nDocument[3](Title: Charles de Rochefort) Charles d'Authier de Rochefort (7 July 1887 \u2013 31 January 1952) was a French film actor, principally of the silent era.

The film, set during the Second Boer War in 1901, is a period drama that follows Willem Morkel, a Cape Rebel Boer/ Afrikaans farmer who was captured and sent to a British prisoner of war camp on St. Helena Island in the Atlantic Ocean. Placed under terrible oppression and hardship, Morkel and his comrades slowly come together to assert their defiance, humanity and human spirit and, more specifically, through the game of rugby. \" Blood and Glory\" is a fictional account, using the backdrop of the Anglo- Boer War with some of the places in the plot resembling historical locations from the war. The film's protagonist, Willem Morkel, is loosely based on Sommie Morkel, who went on to play for the South Africa national rugby union team. The historical authenticity of backdrop events, conditions and attitudes in the plot of the film can be debated, as its depiction of the Boers and the British relies heavily on glorification of the former and vilification of the latter. However, the film's main villain( Australian Colonel Swanell) owes something to the real life Breaker Morant( convicted for murder and as a war criminal by the British during the Boer War and executed). It is documented that 28 000 Boer women and children, as well as 20 000 black people, died in British concentration camps( Professor Fransjohan, 2011 writing for BBC).

It originates in the Great Cedar Swamp to the southeast of Dennisville, New Jersey. Passing between Dennisville and South Dennis, it descends into the tidal marshes and joins Sluice Creek and thereafter forms the boundary between Dennis and Middle Townships. Further below, the channel of Roaring Ditch directs much of the flow of East Creek into Dennis Creek before reaching the bay.\nDocument[3](Title: Mamberamo River) The Mamberamo is a large river on the island of New Guinea, in the Indonesian province of Papua. It is the largest river in Indonesia by volume of discharge, and also the widest. The source of the river is formed from the confluences of its upper tributaries, the Tariku and Taritatu Rivers. From there it flows northwards in a great valley through the Van Rees Range(\" Pegunungan Van Rees\"), to reach the lowland marshes of its broad river delta. The Mamberamo discharges into the Pacific Ocean at the northern point of Point D'Urville(\" Tanjung D' Urville\"). The river's huge valley is home to various uncontacted peoples and incredible biodiversity. In the 1990s, the Indonesian Government had plans to construct a large hydroelectric dam on the Mamberamo that would have submerged much of the area. This plan was shelved after the Indonesian financial crisis from 1998 \u2013 1999, but there are concerns by environmental groups that it could be resurrected sometime in the future. At present, the Mamberamo remains the second largest river in the world to be completely unfragmented by dams in its catchment, behind only the relatively nearby Fly. The Mamberamo area also broadly refers to several nearby mountain ranges, including the Van Rees and Foja Mountains( also known as Foya), which were the subject of a recent rapid biological assessment conducted by Conservation International, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, and Cenderawasih University. The scientific team discovered the first new bird species from New Guinea in 60 years, and a wealth of other new plants and animals. The Foya Mountains appear to be a globally outstanding repository of biodiversity.\n\nQuestion: Are Sand River (Limpopo) and Dennis Creek both located in the same country?": [

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent film era. At the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\". Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, \"National Velvet\" and \"The Human Comedy\", said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\". Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played Puck in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in \"Boys Town\". At 19, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in \"Babes in Arms\", and he was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award in 1939. At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer. Rooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941 and one of the best-paid actors of that era, but his career would never again rise to such heights. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961), \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" (1962), \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), and \"The Black Stallion\" (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in \"Sugar Babies\" and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an Emmy in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in \"Bill\" (1981).\nDocument[2](Title: American Idol) In the May 23 season finale, Jordin Sparks was declared the winner with the runner-up being Blake Lewis.

The ballad was written by Freddie Mercury, dedicating it to Mary Austin, his ex-girlfriend. After Queen performed the song in South America in 1981, the version from their live album\" Live Killers\" reached number 1 in the singles chart in Argentina and Brazil, and stayed in the charts in Argentina for an entire year. Freddie Mercury wrote it on the piano and guitar first, and Brian May rearranged the song for acoustic 12- string guitar for live performances, also lowering the key by a minor third. May contributed occasional guitar phrases to the original recording and played the swooping harp glissandos by pasting together multiple takes of single chords. The song is an example of Mercury's familiarity with rubato phrasing, showcasing his classical piano influences, notably by Chopin and Beethoven. With its similar lyrical theme, the Roger Taylor penned single\" These Are the Days of Our Lives \u201d would later hearken back to\" Love of My Life\", twice using the line\" I still love you\". At the end of\" These Are the Days of Our Lives\", Mercury simply speaks those words, as he would often do in live versions of\" Love of My Life\". \u201c Love of My Life \u201d is written about Mary Austin- the true love of Freddie Mercury \u2019s life. Written entirely by Freddie Mercury himself, this song is a confessional on his love and affection towards Mary Austin.\nDocument[3](Title: Beware My Love) \" Beware My Love\" is a rock song credited to Paul and Linda McCartney that was first released on the Wings 1976 album\" Wings at the Speed of Sound\".

The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone. It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. The main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China.

Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus was the son born to the Aristocrat Lucius Vibullius Rufus and the noblewoman Athenais. He had an elder paternal half brother called Lucius Vibullius Claudius Herodes. The parents of Hipparchus were paternal second cousins. The paternal grandfather of Hipparchus was Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus who served as an Archon of Athens in 143- 144 AD, while his maternal grandparents were Roman Senator, Sophist Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes or Herodes Atticus and the Roman aristocratic noblewoman Aspasia Annia Regilla. His grandfathers were first cousins as the mother of Herodes Atticus and the father of Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus were brother and sister. Through his late maternal grandmother, Hipparchus was a relative to the family of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and the Roman Empress Faustina the Elder. When Hipparchus was born, Athenais named him in honor of his maternal grandfather and paternal great grandfather. Shortly after his birth Athenais had died. Hipparchus was raised by his father, even perhaps by his maternal grandfather. He was born and raised in Athens. According to surviving inscriptions, Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus is the only recorded grandchild of Herodes Atticus and Aspasia Annia Regilla. Apart from Hipparchus, there is a possibility that Herodes Atticus and Aspasia Annia Regilla could have other grandchildren from their other children \u2019s marriages.

Louis was crowned in Reims at the age of 12, following the death of his father Louis VIII; his mother, Blanche of Castile, ruled the kingdom as regent until he reached maturity. During Louis' childhood, Blanche dealt with the opposition of rebellious vassals and obtained a definitive victory in the Albigensian Crusade which had started 20 years earlier. As an adult, Louis IX faced recurring conflicts with some of the most-powerful nobles, such as Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter of Dreux. Simultaneously, Henry III of England tried to restore his continental possessions, but was utterly defeated at the battle of Taillebourg. His reign saw the annexation of several provinces, notably parts of Aquitaine, Maine and Provence. Louis IX was a reformer and developed French royal justice, in which the king was the supreme judge to whom anyone could appeal to seek the amendment of a judgment. He banned trials by ordeal, tried to prevent the private wars that were plaguing the country, and introduced the presumption of innocence in criminal procedure. To enforce the application of this new legal system, Louis IX created provosts and bailiffs. Following a vow he made after a serious illness and confirmed after a miraculous cure, Louis IX took an active part in the Seventh and Eighth Crusades. He died from dysentery during the latter crusade, and was succeeded by his son Philip III. Louis's actions were inspired by Christian zeal and Catholic devotion. He decided to severely punish blasphemy (for which he set the punishment to mutilation of the tongue and lips), gambling, interest-bearing loans and prostitution. He spent exorbitant sums on presumed relics of Christ, for which he built the Sainte-Chapelle. He expanded the scope of the Inquisition and ordered the burning of Talmuds and other Jewish books. He is the only canonized king of France, and there are consequently many places named after him.\nDocument[3](Title: Louis I, Count of \u00c9tampes) Louis d' \u00c9vreux, Count of \u00c9tampes( 1336 \u2013 6 May 1400) was the son of Charles d' \u00c9vreux and Maria de La Cerda y Lara.

The song was released on December 1, 1993, as the ninth and final single from the \"Dangerous\" album. Following its release\u2014on World AIDS Day of 1993\u2014\"Gone Too Soon\" became a moderate chart success in several countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. The song was released as a cassette single in the US, and became a hit in Zimbabwe, where it charted at number 3. \" Gone Too Soon\" was not a significant critical success, as it received mixed reviews from music critics. \"Gone Too Soon\" was promoted with a music video directed by Bill DiCicco, which showed footage of Jackson and White together, as well as scenes from the latter's funeral. In January 1993, a live performance by Jackson at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration also served as a promotional platform, for both the song and AIDS-related funding. \" Gone Too Soon\" later received more exposure, following the deaths of both Diana, Princess of Wales, and Jackson himself.\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the performer of song Missing My Baby?": [

The father was a Protestant, but the mother was a Catholic, and the children were allowed to follow the religion of the mother. Karl Friedrich was first taught at home, then attended the French Gymnasium at Berlin, the Collegium Romanum at Rome, and the Collegium Sebastianum at Naples. He studied law at Berlin, Munich, and Paris. In 1836 he became an auscultator at Berlin; in 1837 he was a referendar in the court at Aachen, in 1840 secretary of legation at London and Dresden, in 1842 at Lisbon, in 1848 at London. In 1849 he was councillor of legations and member of the ministry of foreign affairs, and in 1850 ambassador at Karlsruhe. While here he was able to win over the Government of Baden for the Prussian policy, and, as Bismarck testified, \"by cautious and tactful bearing to win a commanding position at Karlsruhe for the Prussian government.\" From 1859 Karl Friedrich was Prussian ambassador at Dresden, from 1862 at Brussels, and from 1864 he was minister with full powers at the Diet of the German Confederation at Frankfort. In 1866 he offered at the Diet the Prussian motion for the reform of the German Confederation, and when it was rejected on 14 June, 1866, he declared the withdrawal of Prussia, upon which the Austro-Prussian war began.

His father, Stephen the Posthumous, was the posthumous son of Andrew II of Hungary although Stephen's brothers considered him a bastard. Andrew grew up in Venice, and first arrived in Hungary upon the invitation of a rebellious baron, Ivan K\u0151szegi, in 1278. K\u0151szegi tried to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary, but the conspiracy collapsed and Andrew returned to Venice. Being the last male member of the House of \u00c1rp\u00e1d, Andrew was elected king after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a coronation diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders\u2014Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer\u2014challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule. Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew's reign. The K\u0151szegis, the Cs\u00e1ks, and other powerful families autonomously governed their domains, rising up nearly every year in open rebellion against Andrew.

He is best known for his silent films, in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic, deadpan expression that earned him the nickname \"The Great Stone Face\". Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929\" when he \"worked without interruption\" on a series of films that make him \"the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies\". His career declined afterward with a loss of artistic independence when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, his wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He recovered in the 1940s, remarried, and revived his career as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life, earning an Honorary Academy Award in 1959. Many of Keaton's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded, such as \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924), \"The General\" (1926), and \"The Cameraman\" (1928), with \"The General\" widely viewed as his masterpiece. Among its strongest admirers was Orson Welles, who stated that \"The General\" was cinema's highest achievement in comedy, and perhaps the greatest film ever made.

Nancy Norman studied voice while attending Roosevelt High School. Then, World War II erupted. Many of her classmates of Japanese descent, along with their families, were sent to relocation facilities outside of Los Angeles. During this time, Nancy learned that the renowned \"Swing and Sway\" big band leader Sammy Kaye was going to be holding a contest in Los Angeles. She entered the \"Who Wants to Sing With the Band\" contest and Sammy Kaye was so impressed with Nancy that he immediately signed her on as one of his \"girl singers\" in his \"Swing and Sway\" band. At just 4\u201911\u201d, barely 100lbs, and only 16 years old, \"Little Nancy Norman\" as she was frequently introduced, was underaged and had to be accompanied by her mother when she traveled back to New York City, as well as traveling to other cities with the Sammy Kaye Orchestra. Miss Norman was Sammy Kaye\u2019s lead female singer from 1942 to 1945. Hits featuring Nancy Norman's vocals in the 1940s include: Chickery Chick, Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week), and There Will Never Be Another You. Norman had three songs in the Top 10 according to Billboard\u2019s top jukebox played songs. \" Chickery Chick\" spent four and a half months on the charts, and one month at the top of the charts in 1945, an impressive feat for this young singer. Nancy Norman also introduced several classic songs such as You'll Never Know, and As Time Goes By. She performed with the Sammy Kaye Orchestra across the country including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia. However, following one performance in Boston, Massachusetts with her suggestive rendition of I'm A Big Girl Now, Miss Norman fell to the fate of being \"banned in Boston\" from ever again performing in that city.

Springfield's 1964 debut album,\" A Girl Called Dusty\", sold well enough to make her Philips Records' top- selling female artist. For this, her second album, Philips presented it in a gatefold sleeve and included extensive liner notes. While including a number of fairly standard\" pop\" songs,\" Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty\" also saw Springfield venturing more into show tunes like\" Who Can I Turn To( When Nobody Needs Me)?\" as well as the soul music for which Springfield became so well known for singing. \" Doodlin'\" and\" That's How Heartaches Are Made\" were minor hits for Baby Washington, one of Springfield's personal favourite singers. Springfield also included the song\" La Bamba\", which was a popular concert number for her, though not in step with the general style of the album. In 1960s Britain, it was fairly common for hit singles to be left off albums, as it was assumed that if someone was buying the album, they already had the singles. This was not the case, however, in the US. After Springfield's song\" You Do n't Have to Say You Love Me\" became a huge hit,\" Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty\" was re-titled and resequenced for re-release in the United States as the album\" You Do n't Have to Say You Love Me\". This album featured most of\" Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty\", plus the hit title track. \" Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty\" was released to CD for the first time in the early 1990s, and in 1998 a re-mastered version which included extra tracks was released.\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song When You Were My Girl born?": [

Upon the death of her brother, Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross, she became the heir- presumptive of her niece Euphemia II, Countess of Ross although her husband Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles pressed Mariota's superior claim to the earldom. Domhnall attempted to gain control of the earldom, and sometime after 1405 but before 1411, Domhnall gained control of Dingwall Castle. In the year after the death of the nominal king Robert III of Scotland( 1406), in August 1407, Domhnall sent emissaries to England to the heir of the throne, the captive James Stewart. King Henry IV of England sent his own emissaries the following year to negotiate an alliance against Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, the Guardian of Scotland who was controlling Euphemia and the earldom. With control over the principal seat of the earldom of Ross and support of the exiled heir to the Scottish throne, in 1411 Domhnall felt strong enough to march against Albany's main northern ally, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. At the Battle of Harlaw Domhnall failed to inflict a decisive victory, and withdrew back to the western highlands. In the aftermath, Albany was able to retake Dingwall and seize control of Easter Ross. In 1415, Euphemia was persuaded by Albany to resign the earldom to his own second son, John Stewart, Earl of Buchan. This action was challenged by Domhnall of Islay, who continued to claim the earldom on behalf of Mariota. After the return of King James the latter destroyed the power of the Albany Stewarts, executing the Albany's son and successor Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany. Domhnall had died in 1423, but Mariota continued to enjoy the support of his successor and her own son, Alexander. Alexander took over her claims, and in 1437 her son was recognized as earl by the king. She died in 1440. She had two known children, Alexander and Mariota.\nDocument[2](Title: Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway) Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway (born 22 September 1971) is a Norwegian self-described clairvoyant and the only daughter and elder child of King Harald V and Queen Sonja.

Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, \"Two for the Road\", was composed by Mancini, who wrote many notable theme songs for films, including \"Moon River\" for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". He considered \"Two for the Road\" his favourite of all the songs he wrote. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coup\u00e9, VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re-establish the time period after a jump. In one scene of this movie, Audrey Hepburn appears dressed in a shiny black PVC trouser suit designed by Paco Rabanne. The film was ranked #57 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years... 100 Passions\" list.\nDocument[3](Title: Kenny (1988 film)) Kenny( also known as The Kid Brother) is a 1988 film featuring Kenny Easterday in a semi-autobiographical role.\n\nQuestion: Do both directors of films Sometimes Good and Sweet Sixteen (2002 Film) share the same nationality?": [

Domhnall's father was Gartnait, Earl of Mar. His mother's identity is uncertain, although she seems to have been an elder daughter of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick. It appears likely that he fought on the side of Edward II of England at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March 1322, as it is recorded that afterwards the Earl of Mar took Bartholomew de Badlesmere, who was one of Edward's captured opponents, to Canterbury. In 1332 the regent of Scotland, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, died. On 2 August Domhnall was elected as the new regent at a meeting of the Scottish nobles at Perth. Following the invasion of Edward Balliol, with the support of Edward III of England, Mar led the Scots loyalists to confront them. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Dupplin Moor, only nine days after his election as regent.

He studied film arts at the University of Washington and transferred to the Beijing Film Academy, where he finished his undergraduate studies in directing. In 2001, he wrote and directed \"Bus 44\"  starring Chinese film star Gong Beibi. The film premiered and won awards at the 2001 Venice Film Festival and 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and was invited to 2002 Cannes Film Festival \" Directors' Fortnight\" - becoming the first Chinese short film to be invited in all three festivals' history. The film was covered extensively in the Chinese media and was critically acclaimed in both China and Europe and gained TV and theatrical distribution in territories worldwide. In 2005, Eng wrote and directed a Chinese independent feature film \"Waiting Alone\" , starring an ensemble cast of Chinese stars including Xia Yu, Gong Beibi, Li Bingbing, and featuring cameos from some of Asia's most well-known actors including Chow Yun-fat. The film has been called one of 2005 \"best films\" by over 50 media. \" Waiting Alone \" became a hit after its September 2005 domestic China wide-release, and went on to receive 3 nominations (including Best Picture) at the Chinese Academy Awards (Golden Rooster Awards) -- the first ever in the history of the awards by a foreign director. The film remains the highest-rated romantic comedy in China on Douban and other review sites. Eng was invited, in 2007, to direct the first-ever opening short for the Chinese academy awards.

In 2011, Eng wrote, directed, and produced \"Inseparable\" starring Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, Daniel Wu, Gong Beibi, Yan Ni, and Peter Stormare.

His father Johann Weikhard of Auersperg (1615\u20131677) was a hereditary Imperial Prince and in 1654, Emperor Ferdinand III, in his capacity as King of Bohemia, had enfeoffed him with the Duchy of M\u00fcnsterberg and City of Frankenstein. In 1678, Johann Ferdinand married Countess Anna Maria of Herberstein (1660\u20131726). They had a daughter, Maria Theresa of Auersperg (1686\u20131756), who married Count Georg Siegmund of Auersperg-Kirchberg. Johann Ferdinand died in 1705.

He was Viscount of Aumelas and Lord of Frontignan from 1311 and claimed the title of Prince of Achaea from 1315. He was sent by Frederick III of Sicily to take command of the Catalan Company in Frederick's name, but was rebuffed by Bernat de Rocafort, one of their leaders. On his return with the chronicler Ram\u00f3n Muntaner, he was captured by the Venetians at Negroponte. He had been released by 1310, when he distinguished himself at the siege of Almer\u00eda by killing the son of the King of Guadix. In 1313, he returned to Sicily to take part in the war then in hand with the Angevins and was created Lord of Catania. Margaret of Villehardouin was then in Sicily, seeking to advance her claim to the Principality of Achaea. She gave her daughter Isabella of Sabran to Ferdinand in marriage and resigned Akova and her claim on Achaea to the couple, who were married in Messina. Margaret died in March 1315 in captivity in Chlemoutsi, and her daughter on 7 May 1315 in Catania, shortly after bearing a son, James III of Majorca. Shortly after her death, Ferdinand set out with a small company for the Morea to uphold the claim now held by his son. He seized Clarenza in June 1315 and briefly took control of the Morea. In the autumn of 1315 he took a second wife, Isabella of Ibelin, daughter of the Seneschal of Cyprus. However, his rival claimant Matilda of Hainaut, and her husband Louis of Burgundy returned to the Morea in the spring of 1316 with Venetian aid. Ferdinand's expected aid from Majorca and Sicily was tardy, as was that of the Catalan Company from Athens. Facing superior numbers, he was killed at the Battle of Manolada, near Glarentza, on July 5, 1316. He was succeeded as heir presumptive of Majorca by his elder son, the future King James III, and as Viscount of Aumelas by his posthumous son, Ferdinand.\nDocument[3](Title: Liudolf, Margrave of Frisia) Liudolf of Brunswick (c. 1003 \u2013 23 April 1038) was Margrave of Frisia, Count of Brunswick, Count in the Derlingau and the Gudingau.

Her most significant role in the main plot of an episode came in ``Chuck Versus the Truth, ''in which Ellie attempted to treat nuclear expert Mason Whitney when he was poisoned by Reardon Payne. When Whitney later died, Payne, disguised as a police officer taking a statement, exposed Ellie to the same toxic truth serum he used on Whitney to find where he hid his nuclear codes. Ellie nearly died as a result of the poisoning until Chuck administered the antidote. Although she was in a coma during this time, Ellie became the first person Chuck told about his secret life. She was also among the hostages in the Buy More when Ned Rhyerson crashed his car into the store while evading the police. For her sake, Chuck convinced Devon not to go through with a plan to overwhelm Ned, and later identified himself as the Intersect to Mauser to prevent him from killing her. The bracelet Chuck gave to Sarah in the same episode was a charm bracelet Chuck and Ellie's father gave to their mother when Ellie was born.\nDocument[2](Title: Benedicta Chamberlain) Benedicta Chamberlain( born February 1944) is a British billionaire heiress, a major shareholder in William Grant& Sons.\nDocument[3](Title: List of Ghost Whisperer characters) Beth Gordon (portrayed by Anne Archer), Melinda's mother and Aiden's grandmother, has the ability to communicate with ghosts, but chooses not to.

It was so named by the Mouzon mission in 1952 after a Breton noun which means\" the land close to the sea\". It extends in a northwesterly south- easterly direction at an altitude of about 1 m, over a length of about 3.7 km and a maximum width of 700 m, covering around 200 ha. From the south, a stream passing down the Volcan du Diable feeds the lake, having collected the waters coming from the slopes of the volcano as well as those of the Val d'Enfer and the Val des Trolls, and thus their lakes. Another stream feeds the lake from the north. Lake Armor flows into the marine waters of the Gulf of Morbihan in the Hurley Bay. Near the lake is the only known spot in Kerguelen of\" Elaphoglossum randii\", a small fern endemic to the sub-Antarctic islands of the Indian Ocean, which occurs elsewhere only in the Marion and Prince Edward Islands. The southern beaches of Lake Armor are also known for their curious little pebbles, rolled by the waves and nicknamed\" Armor dicks\" because of their evocative shape. An introduction of salmonids has been achieved between 1977 and 1992 in the Lake Armor and its tributaries. The first release of fry occurred in 1977 with Atlantic salmon( Salmo salar) from Scotland. Such a release was reared in 1978 and 1980. Furthermore, an experiment of salmon farming started in 1984, but this time with Pacific species: mainly Coho salmon( Oncorhynchus kisutch) and also Chinook salmon( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). After being raised in floating cages in the freshwater of the lake, the smolts were freed expecting they would come back as adults to their nursery place. In order to monitor this experiment a technical base had been built near the outflow of the lake. The experiment stopped in 1991 and the station was then abandoned. In 1991 and 1992, last releases were done with some young fish of other species: Brown trout( Salmo trutta), Brook trout( Salvelinus fontinalis) from local acclimated populations and Arctic char( Salvelinus alpinus) native to Haute- Savoie. Sedimentological surveys were carried out from 2007 in the northern part of Lake Armor to collect information on the climate changings for 1200 years.\nDocument[2](Title: Lake Balanan) Lake Balanan is a lake situated in Siaton, Negros Oriental in the Philippines.

He was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1992 until 2006, representing Waverley Province. A former teacher and trade unionist, he was a backbencher for about half of his career. The other half was spent as Chairman of the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee 1996-99 and Chairman of the prestigious Road Safety Committee from 1999-2002. He served two years as Shadow Cabinet Secretary in an understaffed shadow ministry from 2002- 2004. He did not contest the 2006 state election, having a long-standing belief that political parties need to regenerate. Brideson was born in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, and studied at Bentleigh and McKinnon High Schools. He studied teaching at Frankston Teachers College and the Hawthorn Institute of Education, and occupied teaching positions at various rural schools in the West Gippsland and Wimmera regions between 1964 and 1975. In 1976, he was promoted to the position of deputy principal, and worked in this position in a number of schools. During his teaching career, Brideson had been an active trade unionist in both the Teachers Association of Australia and Victorian Affiliated Teachers Federation, and at the end of the 1983 school year, took up positions heading both organisations. In a rare move for a unionist, Brideson acted as an advisor to several shadow ministers in the conservative Liberal Party state opposition of the time. He was an active participant in the Victorian Trades Hall Council and was a delegate at ACTU conferences. He led the Victorian organisation until his move into politics in October 1992. In the leadup to the 1992 state election, Brideson succeeded in obtaining Liberal preselection for the seat of Waverley Province which was held by the Labor Party. In his first six-year term, he served on the Public Bodies Review Committee (1992\u20131996).He also served as the parliamentary representative on the Monash University Council from 1997. However, he was overlooked for a ministerial position in Jeff Kennett's Liberal government. He was re-elected at the 1999 election, which saw the Liberal Party lose power to the Labor Party under Steve Bracks, but was subsequently appointed Chairman of the Road Safety Committee regardless. In this way, he headed an inquiry that aimed to bring down the number of road deaths, after it had reached its highest number for several years. Though his term was for the most part relatively uneventful, Brideson was involved in a minor scandal in 2001 when he was accused of plagiarising parts of a parliamentary report by taking slabs of material directly from the internet. Brideson did not face election in 2002, which saw the Liberal opposition defeated in a landslide, which saw the other Liberal member for Waverley Province lose their seat, as well as several shadow members. The devastating loss opened up numerous shadow ministerial positions, and Brideson was given the portfolios of scrutiny of government and waste watch and appointed as the Secretary to the Shadow Cabinet. He was a relatively low-profile figure in these roles, however, and received far less attention than his predecessor, David Davis. He subsequently lost the first two positions to younger MLC Richard Dalla-Riva in January 2004, though he remained Secretary to the Shadow Cabinet without portfolio for the remainder of his career. Brideson kept a particularly low profile after his demotion, and rumors of his impending retirement began circulating in late 2004. On 11 March 2005, Brideson became the second Liberal frontbencher to announce publicly that he would not be contesting his seat at the 2006 state election. He also suggested that other older Liberal MPs should consider stepping down at the election.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, William L. Holland or Dale Vince?": [

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \" Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for\" his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/ native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry\" at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film,\" The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's\" Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\"( 1925). \" The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its\" social critique\" and\" because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films,\" Wara Wara\"( 1930) and\" Hacia la Gloria\"( 1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and\" Wara Wara\" remains\" the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent- film era\". He also made short documentary films,\" before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is\" Amerindia\"( 1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas. In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease. He and Hood moved to Houston for better medical care.

Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement. His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" the following year. The album featured \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall.\" For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and the more lyrically abstract and introspective \"Another Side of Bob Dylan\" in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: \"Bringing It All Back Home\" (1965), \"Highway 61 Revisited\" (1965) and \"Blonde on Blonde\" (1966). The six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) has been described as challenging and transforming the \"artistic conventions of its time, for all time.\" In July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album \"The Basement Tapes\" in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in \"John Wesley Harding\" (1967), \"Nashville Skyline\" (1969), and \"New Morning\" (1970). In 1975, he released \"Blood on the Tracks\", which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. The major works of his later career include \"Time Out of Mind\" (1997), \"Love and Theft\" (2001), \"Modern Times\" (2006) and \"Tempest\" (2012). His most recent recordings have comprised versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. Since 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"\nDocument[3](Title: Destination Brooklyn) Destination Brooklyn is the only studio album by American hip hop artist Vicious, which was released on November 1, 1994, on Epic Records.

Konarski was born in \u017barczyce Du\u017ce, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship. He studied from 1725 to 1727 at the Collegium Nazarenum in Rome, where he became a teacher of rhetoric. After that he travelled through France, Germany and Austria and Poland to broaden his education. In 1730 he returned to Poland and began work on a new edition of Polish law, the \"Volumina legum\". From 1736 he taught at the Collegium Resoviense in Rzesz\u00f3w. In 1740 he founded the Collegium Nobilium, an elite Warsaw school for sons of the gentry (\"szlachta\"). He founded the first public-reference library on the European mainland in 1747 in Warsaw. Thereafter he reformed Piarist education in Poland, in accordance with his educational program, the \"Ordinationes Visitationis Apostolicae...\" (1755). His reforms became a landmark in the 18th-century struggle to modernize the Polish education system. Early on, Konarski was associated politically with King Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski; later, with the Czartoryski Familia and King Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski. He participated in the latter's famous \"Thursday dinners.\" Stanis\u0142aw August caused a medal to be struck in Konarski's honour, with his likeness and the motto, from Horace, \"Sapere ausoDare to know!\"). Konarski argued very strongly that the right of veto that had traditionally been exercised by the Polish Nobility was not law but a custom. In his most important work, the four-part \"O skutecznym rad sposobie albo o utrzymywaniu ordynaryinych seym\u00f3w\" ( On an effective way of councils or on the conduct of ordinary sejms, 1760-1763), he unveiled a far-reaching reform program for the Polish parliamentary system and political reorganization of the Commonwealth's central government, which included aiding the monarch with a permanent governing council. Konarski died, aged 72, in Warsaw, Poland. His heart is buried in an urn in the Piarist church in Cracow. His bust can be seen at the entrance to the crypt of this church placed on ulica \u015awi\u0119tego Jana.\nDocument[3](Title: W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wawrzyniak) W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wawrzyniak (15 May 1890 \u2013 1940) was a Polish military commander, holding the rank of major. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wawrzyniak was born in 1890 in the Polish village Antonin in the German Province of Posen. He finished the Gymnasium in Ostr\u00f3w (Ostrowo) and studied law at the Universities of Munich and Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw). He was an active participant in the events of the Republic of Ostr\u00f3w and was given command of the newly formed First Polish Infantry Regiment which was formally sworn in on 13 November 1918. A couple of weeks later the unit was disbanded under pressure from German authorities and those in Pozna\u0144. The soldiers of the First Regiment made their way to the territory of Second Polish Republic. Some of the weapons and ammunition were evacuated from Ostr\u00f3w to Kalisz too. A new unit called \"Oddzial Poznanski\" was formed and Wawrzyniak was given command. Many soldiers of the disbanded First Regiment joined the unit which was renamed to Border Battalion in December. A month later, in January 1919, Wawrzyniak took Ostr\u00f3w again. During the Greater Poland Uprising he was the commander of the 7th district controlled by the insurgents, which included Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski, Odolan\u00f3w, Ostrzesz\u00f3w, and K\u0119pno.

He is the chairperson of PDP\u2013Laban, the ruling political party. Taking office at 71 years old on June 30, 2016, Duterte is the oldest person to assume the Philippine presidency; the record was previously held by Sergio Osme\u00f1a at the age of 65. Born in Maasin, Southern Leyte, Duterte studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City, before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the Philippine Revolution of 1986. Duterte won seven terms and served as mayor of Davao for over 22 years. Frequently described as a populist and a nationalist, Duterte's political success has been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of drug users and other criminals. Human rights groups have documented over 1,400 killings allegedly by death squads operating in Davao between 1998 and May 2016; the victims were mainly drug users, petty criminals and street children. A 2009 report by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights confirmed the \"systematic practice of extrajudicial killings\" by the Davao Death Squad. Duterte has alternately confirmed and denied his involvement. The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in January 2016 stating that they found no evidence that the Davao Death Squad exists, and no evidence to connect the police or Duterte with the killings. The case has since been reopened. Duterte has repeatedly confirmed that he personally killed criminal suspects as mayor of Davao. On May 9, 2016, Duterte won the Philippine presidential election with 39% of the votes, defeating four other candidates, namely Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party (23.5%), Senator Grace Poe (21.4%), former vice president Jejomar Binay of the United Nationalist Alliance (12.7%), and the late Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago of the People's Reform Party (3.4%). During his campaign, he promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals and end crime within six months. His domestic policy has focused on combating the illegal drug trade by initiating the Philippine Drug War. According to the Philippine National Police the death total passed 7,000 in January 2017, after which the police stopped publishing data. Following criticism from United Nations human rights experts that extrajudicial killings had increased since his election, Duterte threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the UN and form a new organization with China and African nations. He has declared his intention to pursue an \"independent foreign policy\", and sought to distance the Philippines from the United States and European Union and pursue closer ties with China and Russia.\nDocument[3](Title: Smaller and Smaller Circles (film)) Smaller and Smaller Circles is a 2017 Filipino mystery drama film directed by Raya Martin with a screenplay by Ria Limjap and Moira Lang, based on the 2002 novel of the same name by F.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood. \"Le Courrier\" describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society. Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\". His first film, \"The Prophecy of the LakeLa profec\u00eda del lago\"), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's \"Coraz\u00f3n Aymara\" (1925). \"The Prophecy of the Lake\" was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, \"Wara Wara\" (1930) and \"Hacia la Gloria\" (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and \"Wara Wara\" remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\". From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is \"Amerindia\" (1940). Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas. In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease. He and Hood moved to Houston for better medical care.

The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden during the first decade of the twentieth century. Following the death of the eponymous children's father( Allan Edwall), their mother( Ewa Fr\u00f6ling) remarries a prominent bishop( Jan Malmsj\u00f6) who becomes abusive towards Alexander for his vivid imagination. Bergman intended\" Fanny and Alexander\" to be his final picture before retiring, and his script is semi-autobiographical. The characters Alexander, Fanny and stepfather Edvard are based on himself, his sister Margareta and father Erik Bergman, respectively. Many of the scenes were filmed on location in Uppsala. The documentary film\" The Making of Fanny and Alexander\" was made simultaneously with the feature and chronicles its production. The production was originally conceived as a television miniseries and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188- minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The television version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312- minute cut is one of the longest cinematic films in history. The theatrical version was released to positive reviews. It won four Academy Awards, including for Best Foreign Language Film; three Guldbagge Awards, including Best Film; and other honours. \" Fanny and Alexander\" was followed by stage adaptations and further semi-autobiographical screenplays by Bergman, released as films in 1992:\" The Best Intentions\", directed by Bille August, and\" Sunday's Children\", directed by Daniel Bergman.\nDocument[2](Title: Newton Aduaka) Newton I.

He was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including \"City for Conquest\" (1940). Noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), and \"East of Eden\" (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar. His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\", one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. \" A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", which introduced James Dean to movie audiences. A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong. \" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event. Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses. \" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous. \" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film \"A Letter to Elia\" as a personal tribute to Kazan.\nDocument[3](Title: Gabriele Muccino) Gabriele Muccino( born 20 May 1967) is an Italian film director.

He later crushed the rebellion of Julius Civilis and returned to Britain as its governor. Because he probably succeeded Caesius Nasica as commander of Legio IX Hispana, and since brothers are often attested as serving in succession in the same post, Anthony Birley suggests that Cerialis was the younger brother of Nasica, and had been adopted by Petillius Rufus, who was known as praetor in AD 28. However, in his monograph of naming practices in the first centuries of the Roman Empire Olli Salomies argues that Cerialis was actually the biological son of Petillius Rufus by a Caesia, who may have been the daughter of a Caesius Cerialis, and Caesius Nasica would not be his brother, \"but a close relative.\"\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Philippe Solari or Stephen Jurika?": [

He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Dur\u00e1n). Dur\u00e1n also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.\nDocument[2](Title: Sila Zandukeli-Sandunov) Sila Nikolaevich Sandunov , born Silovan Nikolozis dze Zandukeli , (born 1756\u2014 Died 1820) was a businessman and actor of Georgian origin active at the court of Catherine the Great.

Eck and Saleh play two police constables in a rural village,' Gary' and' Akmal' who lead fairly unremarkable lives.

However, a series of horrific murders, involving the mutilation of bodies, rock the town, and' Tony'( Mir), a detective from the city, is called in reluctantly to investigate. Whilst the young Akmal is in awe of the dashing detective, Tony's aggressive methods clash with the uptight Gary, and' Chief Carter'( Richard Carter), the officer in charge of the station. Tony is eventually sent back to the city, after shooting a French male stripper. Gary and Akmal soon discover that the murders have a Village People theme, with those murdered having been in one of the occupations of a Village Person, or resembling one. They fearfully deduce that either a policeman or a dentist( Akmal is uncertain, as he does n't clearly remember the Village People, although Gary quickly deduces that it is, in fact, a policeman) will be next to die, as does Tony, who rushes back from the city.

Of uncertain parentage, but most likely a descendant of imperial Bulgarian and Byzantine dynasties, she belonged to the ruling class of the small Crimean Principality of Theodoro. Her close relatives included both warring princes of Theodoro, Alexios II and Isaac, as well as Zuan Tzamplakon, diplomat and leader of \"Stratioti\". With her arrival in Moldavia, Maria underscored the relative impact of Byzantine politics and culture at Stephen's court. She also accepted Byzantine communion with the Catholics, acting as an agent of Catholic influence before returning to Eastern Orthodoxy. Stephen likely married her for political reasons, hoping to conquer the principality, though he lost interest in her when that proved impossible. According to conflicting readings, the Prince either divorced her to marry the Wallachian Maria Voichi\u021ba (who in any case became her successor), or she lived estranged from Stephen without a formal separation. Her portrait is mysteriously absent from a miniature of the Humor Monastery \"Gospel\", possibly removed by her husband. Various late records place Maria Asanina in Eastern Moldavia or on Mount Athos. Her marriage to Stephen had produced as many as five children, of whom only one daughter, Ana, is believed to have survived into adulthood. Maria's elaborate burial shroud, featuring her portrait and Palaiologan insignia, is preserved in Putna Monastery, where she was buried. It endures as a significant landmark in medieval Romanian art, synthesizing Western and Eastern handicrafts. Maria's marriage was fictionalized by Mihail Sadoveanu in \"Fra\u021bii Jderi\".

His most notable portrayal was as the barber in the Academy Award- winning film( 1927). Born in Rochester, New York, Sipperly had a career in the Broadway theatre before breaking into silent films. His earliest known appearance was in a performance of\" A Prince There Was\"( 1918), followed by\" The Meanest Man in the World\"( 1920),\" Six Cylinder Love\"( 1921),\" The Deep Tangled Wild- Wood\"( 1923) and other( mostly) comedies. His first known film part was in the movie version of\" Six Cylinder Love\"( 1923) in which he played the same character he had on- stage. During one theatrical performance of\" Six- Cylinder Love\" in New York in 1921, Sipperly, who played a high- powered car salesman, accidentally drove an actual automobile off the stage and into the first row of seats. No one was injured, though screams erupted in the sold- out hall, and one woman\" became hysterical\" as people scrambled out of the way. The incident made\" The New York Times\" the following day, but apparently had no effect on Sipperly's career. Another\" New York Times\" article of 1925 reported that Sipperly,\" saxophonist de luxe of\" The Fall Guy\" has selected the design for the monument that is to mark the site of his Rochester birthplace. It is to consist of two baseball bats crossed above a dumbbell. It seems that baseball has been the dominant fact in this actor's life.\" Sipperly died in Bangor, Maine, and is buried in that city's Mount Hope Cemetery.\nDocument[2](Title: Samuel Honywood) Samuel Honywood( born 19 October 1996) is an English teen actor best known for having portrayed Sebastian Brown in\" Nanny McPhee\".\nDocument[3](Title: Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet) Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet (4 August 1716 \u2013 6 December 1793) was an English country gentleman.

Director Gliese had previously designed the sets for Wegener's 1915 film \"The Golem\", and later directed Wegener in \"The Golem and the Dancing Girl\" in 1917. He later also worked as a costume designer on Wegener's 1920 film \"The Golem: How He Came into the World\". Thus Gliese was the only person to collaborate on all three of Wegener's \"Golem\" movies. The film co-starred Greta Schroder, who later starred in F.W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu\" (1922). Cameraman Karl Freund later emigrated to the US and worked on many of the classic 1930s Universal horror films, including \"DraculaMad Love\" and Karloff's \"The Mummy\".\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died earlier, Moonlight And Pretzels or Husmandst\u00f8sen?": [

Though nearly all of the Ramones' songs were credited equally to all the band members, Dee Dee was the band's most prolific lyricist and composer, writing many of their best- known songs, such as\" 53 rd& 3 rd Commando Wart HogRockaway BeachPoison Heart\" and\" Bonzo Goes To Bitburg\", retitled\" My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down\". The song\" Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\" won the New York Music Award for best independent single of the year in 1986 and\" Animal Boy\" won for best album. Beauvoir and Dee Dee later co-wrote the song\" Cut Me To Pieces\", which was featured in the film\" Rock and Roll High School Forever\". Dee Dee was initially the band's lead vocalist, though his( then) inability to sing and play bass at the same time resulted in original drummer Joey Ramone taking over the lead vocalist duties( however, he still sang lead vocals in the band on occasion). Dee Dee was the band's bassist and songwriter from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short- lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand- new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band retired.

Harrison began writing the song in 1966 while still a member of the Beatles and during a period when he had first become enamoured with Hindu-aligned spirituality.

The backing musicians include Eric Clapton and the rest of the latter's short-lived band Derek and the Dominos, as well as Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Bobby Keys and Jim Price.

Since Harrison's death in November 2001, the lyrics have received further recognition as a comment on the nature of human existence.

It was the band's first commercially successful album, and is considered to be where the band first consolidated its aggressive hard-rocking sound. The album's best-known track, \"I'm Eighteen\", was released as a single to test the band's commercial viability before the album was recorded. Formed in the mid-1960s, the band took the name Alice Cooper in 1968 and became known for its outrageous theatrical live shows. The loose, psychedelic freak rock of the first two albums failed to find an audience. The band moved to Detroit in 1970 and was influenced by the aggressive hard rock scene there. A young Bob Ezrin was enlisted as producer, and he encouraged the band to tighten its songwriting over two months of rehearsing ten to twelve hours a day. The single \"I'm Eighteen\" achieved top-forty success soon after, peaking at . This convinced Warner Bros. that Alice Cooper had the commercial potential to release an album. After its release in March 1971, \"Love It to Death\" reached on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart and has since been certified platinum. The album's second single, \"Caught in a Dream\", charted at . The original album cover featured the singer Cooper posed with his thumb protruding so it appeared to be his penis; Warner Bros. soon replaced it with a censored version. The Love It to Death tour featured an elaborate shock rock live show: during \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\"\u2014about an inmate in an insane asylum\u2014Cooper would be dragged offstage and return in a straitjacket, and the show climaxed with Cooper's mock execution in a prop electric chair during \"Black Juju\". Ezrin and the Coopers continued to work together for a string of hit albums until the band's breakup in 1974. The album has come to be seen as a foundational influence on hard rock, punk, and heavy metal; several tracks have become live Alice Cooper standards and are frequently covered by other bands.\nDocument[3](Title: Love Is Dead) Love Is Dead may refer to:\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the composer of song Love Is Here To Stay?": [

He played string bass and rhythm guitar for a western band, The Valley Ranch Boys. Two years later he formed a staff band for Pittsburgh radio station KDKA that he named Riders of the Purple Sage after the title of the Zane Grey novel. Riders of the Purple Sage performed five hour-long shows a week on KDKA from 1936\u20131938. The band later moved to New York City and performed on radio station WOR and at a nightclub, Village Barn. Page served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. During the war another western band using the name Riders of the Purple Sage was organized in California by singer Foy Willing. Page moved to the West Coast in the 1950s. He and Willing eventually met and the two men formed a lifelong friendship. Page, who could play 21 instruments, worked as a studio musician in California. He played guitar on the original recording of the theme song for the NBC western series \"Bonanza\" and also served as background musician for the TV shows \"Wagon Train\" and \"Laramie\". According to Bob Bain, however, the only one of the four guitarists on the \"Bonanza\" theme recording still living, Page was not one of the guitarists on that session. In the late 1950s, Page lived in Hesperia, California where he owned and ran a restaurant. He also rodeoed in the summer circuit, traveling with rodeo champion Eddy Akridge. In the 1960s Page worked for the Baldwin Piano Company and helped engineers develop the Supersound amplifier. Page received the Country/Western Living Legend Award from the North American Country Music Associations International in 2001. His first solo recording, \"Right Place to Start\", was released on CD in December 2005. Page's last public concert was in July 2006 in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he performed before a crowd of several thousand people during a National Day of the Cowboy celebration. Page died in his apartment at the Burbank Senior Artists Colony in Burbank, California. His death was attributed to natural causes.\nDocument[2](Title: Memory Motel) \"Memory Motel\" is a ballad song from rock band The Rolling Stones' 1976 album \"Black and Blue\". The song is credited to singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards (named Richard at the time). It is one of the few which feature both members sharing lead vocals. The song itself is over seven minutes long, one of the longest songs by the Rolling Stones. Jagger began writing the song before beginning the Stones' Tour of the Americas '75 while staying with Richards at Andy Warhol's house in Montauk, New York and finished it while on tour. This is reflected in the song's lyrics where Jagger describes having to leave for Baton Rouge, where the Stones played two warm up shows at Louisiana State University, and where he describes subsequent experiences on the road. The title comes from an actual motel in Montauk, on Long Island. The lyrics to the song have long drawn speculation as to who the \"Hannah baby\" in the lyrics refer to. Carly Simon is often a name considered, due to Jagger's descriptions of the woman throughout the song. Jagger describes her thus: The lyrics talk of the fading love brought on by a one-night stand at said motel. The song describes the female subject as a strong, independent woman, comparable in many ways to the female subject of \"Ruby Tuesday\", with Richards repeated refrain:\nRichards did not play guitar on the track, but contributed co-lead vocals alongside Jagger; \"Black and Blue\" has long been known as the album used to find a replacement for Mick Taylor, who left right before work was to begin on it. Harvey Mandel plays electric guitar while Wayne Perkins performs acoustic. Jagger, Richards, and Billy Preston play acoustic piano, electric piano, and string synthesizer on the song, respectively. Preston also contributes backing vocals along with Ron Wood, who would eventually become the Stones' lead guitarist. The song was recorded in Munich, Germany at Musicland Studios in March and April 1975. Overdubs and re-recordings were performed later in the year. \"Memory Motel\" has long been a fan favourite from the Stones' canon of work. It is often overlooked, possibly due to its length and downbeat feel, much like the album it comes from. It was one of the highlights of the Stones' 1998 live album \"No Security\", where Dave Matthews took up lead vocals with Jagger and Richards. The song has been played live on every tour since the 1994 Voodoo Lounge Tour. For an episode of the 1990 TV music show \"Beyond The Groove\" by Jagger collaborator David A. Stewart, Jagger recorded a version of \"Memory Motel\" without Keith Richards. James Patterson and Peter de Jonge, in their 2002 thriller \"The Beach House,\" include a scene set in the Memory Motel and its bar, and refer to the Stones song.\nDocument[3](Title: Kansas (band)) Kansas released its fourth album, Leftoverture, in October 1976, which produced a hit single, ``Carry On Wayward Son '', in 1977.

Making his directorial debut 23 years after his entry into the film business, Roeg quickly became known for an idiosyncratic visual and narrative style, characterized by the use of disjointed and disorienting editing. For this reason, he is considered a highly influential filmmaker, with such directors as Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan, and Danny Boyle citing him as such. In 1999, the British Film Institute acknowledged Roeg's importance in the British film industry by respectively naming \"Don't Look Now\" and \"Performance\" the 8th and 48th greatest British films of all time in its Top 100 British films poll.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Pistol Whipped born?": [

Born into a family of film performers, Davenport had her own independent career before her marriage to the film actor and director Wallace Reid in 1913. Reid's star rose steadily, making feature films at a pace of one every seven weeks, until 1919 when a dose of morphine administered for an injury on location grew into an addiction. Reid died in January 1923 at the age of 31. Davenport took her own story as source material and co-produced\" Human Wreckage\"( 1923), in which she was billed as\" Mrs. Wallace Reid\" and played the role of a drug addict's wife. She advertised the film in terms of a moral crusade. Davenport followed its success with other social- conscience films on other topics,\" Broken Laws\"( 1924) and\" The Red Kimono\"( 1925), with expensive litigation connected with the latter. While Davenport's own production company dissolved in the late 1920s, she continued to take on smaller writing and directing roles. In 1929 Davenport directed\" Linda\" a film about a woman who gives up her happiness for the sake of men and social expectations.

The son of John and Eliza Mitchell, he was educated at a private academy and apprenticed as a cabinet maker. In 1887 Sagar and his father John founded the firm of S. & J. Mitchell, a photographic apparatus manufacturing and dealing business. Although associated in partnership with James Kenyon since 1897 little is known of their film production until 1899. The success of their early films encouraged Mitchell to give up his shop and in September 1901 Mitchell and Kenyon moved into premises in Clayton Street, Blackburn, to concentrate on film production. Mitchell and Kenyon used the trade name of \"Norden\", the company became one of the largest film producers in the United Kingdom in the 1900s, producing a mixture of \"topicals\" (films of street scenes, sporting events, rides through towns on the top of trams, and ordinary life, which were extremely popular as people loved to see moving pictures of themselves), fiction, and fake war films. Many of these films were produced for travelling showmen. In May 1907 Sagar Mitchell resumed possession of his original business S. & J. Mitchell, at 40 Northgate, Blackburn. The volume of film production seems to have tailed off from this date, and from 1909 was increasingly restricted to local events. The last surviving film dates from 1913. Mitchell was joined in his business by his son John in 1921. His partnership with Kenyon was formally dissolved around 1922 and Kenyon died in 1925. Mitchell carefully stored the film negatives away in the basement of his shop. He lived to the age of 85, and died on 2 October 1952. John continued to run the business until he retired in 1960. Over the years film historians had traditionally regarded Mitchell and Kenyon as minor contributors to film history, known principally for the fake Boer War films that had survived. Then in 1994, during building alteration work at the premises in Northgate, three large sealed steel drums were discovered in the basement. On examination, the drums were discovered to contain the original nitrate negatives of 800 Mitchell and Kenyon films in a remarkably good state of preservation. These eventually found their way in 2000 to the National Film and Television Archive, where they extended the holdings of films of the 1900-1913 period by 20%, giving a new and fresh view of Edwardian England and an important resource for historians. A further 65 fiction films are preserved in The Cinema Museum, London. The survival of these films has allowed Mitchell and Kenyon's place in English film history to be reappraised. In 2014 \"The Life and Times of Mitchell and Kenyon\" was produced at The Dukes, Lancaster and the Oldham Coliseum, with video elements by imitating the dog. \"For more information on their film work and on the rediscovery of the Mitchell and Kenyon Collection see Mitchell and Kenyon.\"\n\nQuestion: Which country the director of film The Notebooks Of Memory is from?": [

As a child he was known as the prince of Genevois. He was the Duke of Nemours from 1585 to his death in 1595, during the French Wars of Religion. Charles Emmanuel was duke at a volatile time, and subsequently was involved in many political intrigues, mostly by his relationship on his mother's side with the House of Guise. The Duke of Guise was one of the leaders of the Catholic League opposing the Huguenots, and Charles Emmanuel sympathised with their cause. However, after the assassination of Henry I, Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Guise, Charles Emmanuel was imprisoned by the Huguenots in 1588, but was able to escape. He was to fight the Huguenot forces for some years; he fought at the Battle of Arques in 1589. That same year, Charles Emmanuel was the governor of Paris, as the Huguenot forces, led by Henry of Navarre besieged Paris. During the siege, King Henry III of France perished, and Henry of Navarre soon declared himself King Henry IV of France. Charles Emmanuel escaped, and fought the newly proclaimed King at the Ivry in 1590, which was a decisive loss for the Catholic League. The same year he commanded Catholic forces during the Siege of Paris, successfully defending the city. After the defeat, Charles Emmanuel strongly disagreed with his half-brother and long-time ally Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne (also of the House of Guise), who advocated conciliation with Henry IV. Charles Emmanuel withdrew to his government in Lyonnais, where he endeavoured to make himself independent from the French crown. He was imprisoned, however, in the chateau of Pierre-Encise by the archbishop of Lyon. Again, he successfully escaped, and decided to attack Lyon. The intervention of the Constable de Montmorency thwarted his attack however, and his attempt at independence failed. He died at Annecy in 1595, leaving the Duchy of Nemour to his brother Henri de Savoie.\nDocument[2](Title: Anna Amalie of Baden-Durlach) Anna Amalia of Baden- Durlach( born: 9 July 1595; died: 18 November 1651 in Saarbr\u00fccken) was a Countess of Nassau- Saarbr\u00fccken by marriage to William Louis, Count of Nassau- Saarbr\u00fccken, and regent of Nassau- Saarbr\u00fccken during the minority of her son from 1640.\nDocument[3](Title: Maurice Henry, Prince of Nassau-Hadamar) Maurice Henry, Prince of Nassau- Hadamar( 23 April 1626, in Hadamar \u2013 24 January 1679, in Hadamar) was \u2014 after his father \u2014 the second ruler of the younger Nassau- Hadamar line of the Ottonian branch of the House of Nassau.\n\nQuestion: Who is the child-in-law of Marie De Namur?": [

Michael was fourth-in-line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line and, in 1894, after the death of his father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir presumptive. The birth of Nicholas's son Alexei in 1904 moved Michael back to second-in-line, but Alexei was gravely-ill with hemophilia and Michael suspected the boy would die, leaving him as heir. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel to avoid scandal but this did not deter Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple's only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought Natalia to St. Petersburg where she was shunned by society.

However the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim. The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were \"exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature\" that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand. Indeed, in 2013 a claim of a Kiribati man of being a \"climate change refugee\" under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable as there was no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated Refugee Convention grounds.

Widely recognized as a pivotal figure in early jazz, Morton was jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential spirit and characteristics when notated. His composition \"Jelly Roll Blues\", published in 1915, was the first published jazz composition. Morton also wrote the standards \"King Porter StompWolverine BluesBlack Bottom Stomp\", and \"I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say\", the last a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century. Morton's claim to have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment. The jazz historian, musician, and composer Gunther Schuller says of Morton's \"hyperbolic assertions\" that there is \"no proof to the contrary\" and that Morton's \"considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation\". Alan Lomax, who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938, did not agree that Morton was an egotist: In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If we read the words that he himself wrote, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex and said that he created his own style of jazz piano because \"All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and I did not feel as though I was in their class.\" So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points\". --Quoted in John Szwed, \"Dr Jazz\".\nDocument[2](Title: L\u00e9on Laya) L\u00e9on Laya (c.1810 in Paris \u2013 5 September 1872 in Paris) was a 19th-century French playwright.

Djajakusuma) Djadoeg Djajakusuma (1 August 1918 \u2013 28 October 1987) was an Indonesian film director and promoter of traditional art forms. Born to a nobleman and his wife in Temanggung, Central Java, Djajakusuma became interested in the arts at a young age, choosing to pursue a career in theatre. During the Japanese occupation from 1943 to 1945 he was a translator and actor, and in the four-year national revolution which followed he worked for the military's educational division, several news agencies, and in drama. In 1951, Djajakusuma joined the National Film Corporation (Perfini) at the invitation of Usmar Ismail. After making his directorial debut with \"Embun\", Djajakusuma released a further eleven films with the company before leaving in 1964. He then returned to traditional Indonesian theatre, including \"wayang\". Although he continued to direct movies independently of Perfini, most of his energies were dedicated to promoting traditional art forms and teaching cinematography. After over a decade of poor health and high blood pressure, Djajakusuma collapsed during a ceremony and died. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery. The dedicated but easily angered Djajakusuma was influenced by Usmar Ismail's realist views, although he focused more on traditional aspects of life. His theatrical performances attempted to modernize traditional forms so that they could be better received in a modern world. He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form \"lenong\" and received numerous awards for his filmmaking, including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival.\nDocument[3](Title: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, and Jeff Nathanson wrote drafts before David Koepp's script satisfied the producers.
