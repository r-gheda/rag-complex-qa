During the Early Middle Ages, he united the majority of western and central Europe. He was the first recognised emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire. He was later canonized by Antipope Paschal III. Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon, born before their canonical marriage. He became king in 768 following his father's death, initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne the sole ruler of the Frankish Kingdom. He continued his father's policy towards the papacy and became its protector, removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain. He campaigned against the Saxons to his east, Christianizing them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden. He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Rome's Old St. Peter's Basilica. Charlemagne has been called the \"Father of EuropePater Europae\"), as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule. His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church. Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire considered themselves successors of Charlemagne, as did the French and German monarchs. The Eastern Orthodox Church viewed Charlemagne less favorably due to his support of the filioque and the Pope's having preferred him as Emperor over the Byzantine Empire's Irene of Athens. These and other disputes led to the eventual split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054. Charlemagne died in 814 and was laid to rest in his imperial capital city of Aachen. He married at least four times and had three legitimate sons who lived to adulthood, but only the youngest of them, Louis the Pious, survived to succeed him.\n\nQuestion: Who is Charles Bretagne Marie De La Tr\u00e9moille's paternal grandfather?": [

(Antakaa Meille Luurankomme in Finnish, Oaivveskaldjut in North Sami) is a 1999 documentary film directed by Paul-Anders Simma about Niillas Somby, a Sami man who retraces his family ancestry as he searches for the head of his ancestor, Mons Somby. Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jakobsen H\u00e6tta were executed by decapitation on 14 October 1854 for murder, following the 1852 Kautokeino rebellion against the local Norwegian government in which two people were murdered. Their heads were claimed by the government for scientific research, and were held as part of a collection of 900 skulls at the Anatomical Institute, in Oslo. The movie describes three parallel plots; the first is Niillas Somby's story on how he became one of the most celebrated protesters during the Alta Dam Protests between 1979-1981 near Kautokeino, Norway. In the years that followed, he traveled in exile to Canada where he was given sanctuary by the Iroquois First Nation, and later returned to Norway. The second plot was the disturbing examination of the scientific racism and racial classification movement that was considered an accepted fact by Scandinavian scientists from the early 19th century until the 1950s. This included the plundering of Sami graves for their skeletons and the forced sterilization of the Sami and other peoples in Scandinavia who were viewed as competing with the \"noble races\", as part of a larger eugenics program. The third and final plot was Niillas Somby's emotional struggle with bringing Mons Somby's skull home for a proper burial.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film Mole Men Against The Son Of Hercules?": [

Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia (1354\u20131360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41-year-old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief. Their only known child, a son named Philip, was born in 1371 and died the same year. Elizabeth was widowed on 25 November 1374.

It lies on the left bank of the Northern Dvina River, along the Kholmogory Highway, southeast of Arkhangelsk and north of the Antonievo- Siysky Monastery. The name is derived from the Finnish\" Kalmom\u00e4ki\" for\" corpse hillcemetery\"). Population: The Kholmogory area was at first in historical times inhabited by the Finno- Ugrians\" Savolotshij Thsuuds\",( sa-volokis, i.e.\" the Chud[ who live] beyond the portage\"), known also as Yems in old Novgorod chronicles, and Karelians. The first Slavonic population to enter to Kalmam\u00e4ki were Pomors from Vologda area after 1220. As early as the 14th century, the village( the name of which was then spelled\" Kolmogory\") was an important trading post of the Novgorod Republic in the Far North of Russia. Its commercial importance further increased in 1554 when the English Muscovy Company made it a center of its operations in furs. The Polish- Lithuanian vagabonds( see Lisowczycy) besieged the wooden fort during the Time of Troubles( 1613), but had to retreat in failure. In the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, the settlement was also a place of exile, notably for ex-regent Anna Leopoldovna and her children. In 1682, the six- pillared Kholmogory cathedral was consecrated; the biggest in the region. It was disfigured by the Communists in the 1930s. Many ancient wooden shrines and mills, however, still survive in the neighborhood. One of the nearby villages is the birthplace of the Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov. Local artisans\u2014such as Fedot Shubin\u2014have been famed for their craft of carving the tusks of mammoths and walruses. In Kholmogory, a craft of Kholmogory bone carving was developed in the 17th century. The bone carvings from Kholmogory were notable for excellent craftsmanship and perfected technique. The best carving masters from Kholmogory were invited to work in the Kremlin Armoury, which performed orders for the tsar \u2019s court. The handicraft reached its peak under the reign of Peter the Great. Currently the carving is being performed at the Lomonosov Bone Carving Factory.\n\nQuestion: Are both Nikolsk Airport and Svobodny Airport located in the same country?": [

Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi.

He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory. Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanic laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children.

Mendes de Leon was the son of Isaac Mendes de Leon( 1808 \u2013 1856) and Annely F. Phillips and grandson of Amsterdam city council member Jacobo Abraham Mendes de Leon( 1784- 1842) whose father, Abraham Jacob Mendes de Leon( 1764- 1818), was also an Amsterdam city council member. He grew up in his mothers country, England, until the age of ten, after which the family moved to Amsterdam. He studied medicines at the University of Amsterdam and in 1881 obtained a PhD at the University of Heidelberg. In 1882 he married his distant relative Anna Mathilde Teixeira de Mattos( 1862\u2013 1937). He promoted gynaecology in the Netherlands as a separate speciality, partly because of the new surgical possibilities following the discoveries of anaesthesia and antisepsis and in 1889 he started a private gynaecological clinic at the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam. In his clinic he devoted himself to the surgery of ovarian tumours, uterus myomatosus and genital prolapse, but also to the diagnosis and treatment of supposed inflammations of the cervix and endometrium as cause of psychological disorders. In this he followed the opinions of contemporary English gynaecologists. As he was not aware of physiological histology, he nearly always found signs of inflammation. He treated this with curettage and drastic caustics, sometimes after using a dilation knife( hysterotome) for the cervix. At the turn of the twentieth century Dutch gynaecologists such as Treub and Nijhoff began to cast doubt on such theories of\" reflex neurosis\", but Mendes de Leon persisted in his views.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Jo Planckaert's father?": [

He was accompanied by his wife, Kwailan, and his five- year- old son Pierre. As the first known Trinidadian sailors to cross the Atlantic and later to circumnavigate, Harold and Kwailan were awarded the nation's highest honour \u2013 the Gold Trinity Cross. Harold was born in Trinidad, West Indies, on June 18th 1933( died June 2016), of parents with a rich mixture of blood in their veins \u2013 French, African, Spanish and Amerindian( Carib). He was educated at a local Roman Catholic school and began his sailing career by building dinghies, in which he taught himself the rudiments of seamanship, and reading any book about deep- sea sailing that he could lay his hands on. Harold La Borde was determined to get a suitable boat, opting to build one himself. In his first book,\" An Ocean to Ourselves\"( 1962), La Borde tells how he built a 26- foot ketch\" Humming Bird\". Harold and Kwailan, who were married in 1959, made their maiden voyage in the 26- foot vessel,\" Humming Bird\", to England in 1960, together with a friend, Buck Wong Chong. The\" Humming Bird\" was subsequently sold, and says Harold\" is somewhere in Europe.\" The La Bordes, always working as a team, took jobs at an Outward Bound school in Nigeria in 1961, after the voyage, but the call of the sea was too strong for the young couple and they returned to Trinidad in 1963, when they started to build the 40- foot ketch\" Humming Bird II\". Their first- born son, Pierre, arrived while work was in progress. The boat was completed in three years and, after chartering her out to Americans for a further three years in order to raise sufficient funds, the family set out on 2 February 1969 on the, now historic, voyage that took them around the world. Harold and Kwailan were both awarded their nation's highest award, the Trinity Cross for their seafaring adventure. Their second son, Andre, was born in Auckland, New Zealand, during the voyage. Upon their return home, the 40- foot\" Humming Bird II\" was purchased by the Trinidad and Tobago Government in 1973, and can be seen in the museum near the lighthouse on South Quay; and according to Harold\" is rotting away there. It is a sad thing, especially when you talk about taking care of historical things.\" The La Bordes went on to another circumnavigation voyage via Cape Horn( 1984 \u2013 86) in the\" Humming Bird III\". Harold La Borde T.C. also wrote a further two books with input from his family, wife Kwailan and sons Pierre and Andr\u00e9,\" All Oceans Blue\"( 1977), and\" Lonely Oceans South\"( 1987). Documentary films of their travels were made in conjunction with the Government Film Unit, which were also very professionally put together. After retiring from their respective jobs in Trinidad, the La Bordes ran a small family marina in Trinidad's busiest yachting bay. Harold's full- time job was working on the Humming Bird III, every day while Kwailan finished their autobiography which includes all of their sailing voyages to the present, entitled\" Wind, Sea, and Faith\". Harold La Borde died on June 12, 2016, leaving behind his wife, sons Pierre and Andre, three grandchildren( Shannon, Arama, and Sanchia), and his brothers Rudy and Hugh.\n\nQuestion: Which one was established first, Noerr or Korn Ferry?": [

He was born in Koto Tuo, Ampek Angkek, Agam Regency, West Sumatra on 6 Dzulhijjah 1276 H( 1860 M) and died in Mecca on 8 Jumadil Awal 1334 H( 1916 M). He served as the head(\" imam\") of the Shafi'i school of law at the mosque of Mecca(\" Masjid al- Haram\"). Many Indonesian Islamic reformist leaders learned from him, including Ahmad Dahlan, as founder Muhammadiyah and Hasyim Asyari, as founder Nahdlatul Ulama. Although Ahmad Khatib was an orthodox Sunni Muslim, he still hoped to reconcile the matrilineal system in Minangkabau with the laws of inheritance prescribed in the Quran. Through his Minangkabau students who studied in Mecca and well as those he taught in Indonesia, he encouraged a modified Minangkabau culture based on al- Quran and the Sunnah. His eldest son Abdulkareem owned a book store in Makkah. His son Abdulmalik Alkhatib was an ambassador of the Ashraf to Egypt. His son, Sheikh Abdulhameed Alkhateeb, was the first Saudi Arabian ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

The film stars Kapoor as the eponymous character, with Simi Garewal, Kseniya Ryabinkina and Padmini in supporting roles, and was also the debut of Kapoor's son Rishi Kapoor. The plot focuses on a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows. Three women who shaped his life view his final performance. The film is one of the lengthiest films of Indian cinema. After\" Sangam\" became a blockbuster,\" Mera Naam Joker\" was highly anticipated as it was under production for six years and heavily publicized, loosely based on Kapoor's own life. The film was partly made with the participation of Soviet actors and was partly shot in Moscow. The film's music, still very popular, was composed by Shankar Jaikishan, for which the duo got their ninth Filmfare award. In India, upon release the film was rejected by audiences and critics, putting Kapoor into a financial crisis, as the film was panned for its length and plot. The film has gained a cult status, and is regarded as a classic today. Both audience's and critics' response has turned highly favorable with the passage of time. An abridged version was released in the 1980s and had a highly successful run at the box office. Kapoor termed it his favorite film and described it as having deep philosophical depth and meaning. The film is regarded as one of Kapoor's finest works today with film experts labeling it as a\" misunderstood masterpiece\". In the Soviet Union, the film also initially drew a mixed reaction from critics, yet commercially became a blockbuster at the Soviet box office after it released there in 1972. Rather than being released as a single film, the film's three chapters were released separately as three parts in the Soviet Union.\n\nQuestion: Do both films: Gammat Jammat and Ready (2011 Film) have the directors from the same country?": [

Mullineaux correctly predicted that Mount St. Helens would erupt before the end of the 20th century. Born in Galesburg, Illinois, Crandell fought in World War II as a lieutenant in an Army mortar platoon. Once the war had finished he returned to America and earned a doctorate from Yale. It was then he was placed at the USGS office in Colorado. Crandell and Mullineaux, who met at the offices then began to work on the theory that Mount St. Helens will erupt. The pair proved that about 5,600 years earlier, the summit of Mount Rainier had collapsed and caused a landslide filling some valleys up to 400 feet deep. That awakened the recognition that a similar event could endanger hundreds of thousands of people living atop the ancient mudflows. They went on to write the 1978 report that claimed Mount St. Helens is \u201can especially dangerous volcano\u201d and it would more than likely erupt before the end of the 20th century. On May 18, 1980 their predictions came true when the volcano erupted killing 57 people and caused more than $1 billion worth of damage. He retired shortly after the eruption. Crandell died in a hospice in Colorado on April 6, 2009 after suffering a heart attack. He was survived by his two daughters, three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His wife died in 2006 and her ashes were scattered at Mount Rainier where he had worked many years before.

Most of the film describes the Nazis' crimes in detail, particularly those committed in the Soviet Union. It claims that if not stopped, the Nazis would have \"turned the whole world into a Majdanek\". It also includes some elements of anti-capitalist propaganda, claiming that the real rulers of Germany were \"armament kings\" such as Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. Of the Holocaust and the recovery of gold from its victims, the film accurately notes that the Nazis \"even made death into a commercial enterprise.\" It is noted in the film that the Soviet Union objected to the acquittal of Hans Fritzsche, Franz von Papen and Hjalmar Schacht, and to the fact that Rudolf Hess was given a sentence of life imprisonment, rather than a death sentence. The film shows the corpses of the executed Nazis, before ending with the words \"Let the Nuremberg Trial be a stern warning to all warmongers. Let it serve the cause of world-wide peace \u2013 of an enduring and democratic peace\" spoken while displayed on-screen. The film does not refer to the Auschwitz concentration camp by the German name by which it is usually known in the English-speaking world, but instead, referred to \"the martyrs of Majdanek and Osventsim\", using the original Polish name \"O\u015bwi\u0119cim/Oswiecim\".\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Guilty Of Treason?": [

Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long - gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th - century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born earlier, Jayam Manade or Bulldog Drummond'S Revenge?": [

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino, but which reduced papal finances. In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter's Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther's 95 Theses. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal Bull of 1520, \"Exsurge Domine\", condemned Martin Luther's condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult. He borrowed and spent money without circumspection. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, \"Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it. \" Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Leo also reorganised the Roman University, and promoted the study of literature, poetry and antiquities. He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Alessandro Vitelli's father?": [

Autry was the owner of a television station, several radio stations in Southern California, and the Los Angeles/ California/ Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997. From 1934 to 1953, Autry appeared in 93 films, and between 1950 and 1956 hosted\" The Gene Autry Show\" television series. During the 1930s and 1940s, he personified the straight- shooting hero\u2014honest, brave, and true\u2014and profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important pioneering figures in the history of country music, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers. His singing cowboy films were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. In addition to his signature song,\" Back in the Saddle Again\", and his hit\" At Mail Call Today\", Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs, most especially his biggest hit\" Rudolph, the Red- Nosed Reindeer\" as well as\" Frosty the Snowman Here Comes Santa Claus\", and\" Up on the House Top\". Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for film, television, music, radio, and live performance.

The song is credited to Little Richard, Edwin Bocage (Eddie Bo), Al Collins, and James Smith. Al Collins first recorded \"I Got the Blues for You\" in 1955. Eddie Bo wrote new lyrics and adapted the song in 1956 under the name \"I'm Wise\". Bo's recording was released by the Apollo label. Little Richard recorded it the same year, and changed the title to \"Slippin' and Slidin'\". His version is on his first album, \"Here's Little Richard\". He recorded several versions for Specialty until the February, 1956 version was chosen as the B-side to \"Long Tall Sally\". Richard re-recorded the song for Vee Jay in 1964 and Modern in 1965 (live). Another version appeared on a Modern single, #1030, believed to be a studio leftover from Vee Jay. \"Slippin' and Slidin'\" was the title of a song written by Maxwell Davis and performed by Calvin Boze and His All Stars, and released in May 1951 by Aladdin Records (3086). The song was described as \"an engaging set of novelty lyrics, while combo puts down a swingy, medium shuffle\". Over a year earlier, this song had been recorded by Gene Phillips - Jack McVea, and released on Modern (20-733). It was a fast blues with Phillips delivering in a Louis Jordan-like style.

Her husband was Emperor Wenxuan( Gao Yang), the first emperor of Northern Qi. Li Zu'e was the daughter of Li Xizong( \u674e\u5e0c\u5b97), and she was from Zhao Commandery( \u8d99\u90e1, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). She was ethnically Han. The date that she married Gao Yang, the second son of Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan, is not known, but it is known that at that time, he was the Duke of Taiyuan during the reign of his brother- in- law, Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei\u2014and she carried the title of Duchess of Taiyuan. She bore him two sons, Gao Yin, and Gao Shaode( \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7). In 549, Gao Yang took over the regency of Eastern Wei after his older brother, Gao Cheng, was assassinated by the servant Lan Jing( \u862d\u4eac). In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi( as Emperor Wenxuan). Emperor Wenxuan, before he became emperor, also had another key consort\u2014his concubine Lady Duan, the sister of his cousin and the powerful official Duan Shao( \u6bb5\u97f6). ( Duan Shao was born of Gao Yang's aunt, but it is not clear that Lady Duan shared the same mother, so it is not clear whether Lady Duan was his cousin.) The officials Gao Longzhi( \u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b) and Gao Dezheng( \u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), wanting to ingratiate themselves with Duan Shao, suggested that a Han woman should not be allowed to be empress. Emperor Wenxuan rejected their suggestion and created Li Zu'e empress, and only created Lady Duan an imperial consort. Emperor Wenxuan also created Empress Li's son Gao Yin crown prince. Emperor Wenxuan was violent and capricious in his behavior, fueled by his alcoholism, and often beat his consorts, although he never touched Li Zu'e. Once, when visiting Empress Li's household, he fired an arrow at Empress Li's mother, stating,' When I am drunk, I do not even recognize my own mother. Who do you think you are?\" However, despite Emperor Wenxuan's violent behavior \u2014 which included battering his concubines and sometimes even killing them \u2014he remained respectful of Empress Li herself. In 559, he also began to have her referred to as both\" Kehedun\"( \u53ef\u8cc0\u9813, the Tujue title for empresses) and empress. Emperor Wenxuan died in 559, and Gao Yin succeeded to the throne as Emperor Fei. Empress Li became empress dowager. However, the political climate of the time was uncertain, as there were suspicions that Emperor Wenxuan's mother, Grand Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun, would encourage her sons Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan or Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang to seize the throne. The prime minister Yang Yin, believing that the young Emperor Fei was being endangered, discussed a plan with Empress Dowager Li to gradually strip Gao Yan and Gao Zhan of power. Empress Li discussed the plan with one of Gao Cheng's widow consorts, Li Changyi( \u674e\u660c\u5100), who was her good friend coming from the same clan of Li. Li Changyi subsequently revealed the plan to Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who in turn relayed the news to Gao Yan and Gao Zhan. The two princes responded by arresting and executing Yang and his associates Kezhuhun Daoyuan( \u53ef\u6731\u6e3e\u9053\u5143), Song Qindao( \u5b8b\u6b3d\u9053), and Yan Zixian( \u71d5\u5b50\u737b). Gao Yan and Gao Zhan took over the reins of government, and Empress Dowager Li lost her remaining authority. Six months later, by Grand Empress Dowager Lou's decree, Emperor Fei was deposed, and Gao Yan became emperor( as Emperor Xiaozhao). Empress Dowager Li lost her empress dowager title, and became known as Empress Zhaoxin, because she resided at Zhaoxin Palace. In 561, Emperor Xiaozhao killed her son Gao Yin the former emperor. Emperor Xiaozhao died in 561, and Gao Zhan became emperor( as Emperor Wucheng). Some time after Emperor Wucheng's taking the throne, he began to force Empress Li to have a sexual relationship with him \u2014 threatening her that he would kill her son Gao Shaode if she did not agree. Eventually, she became pregnant, and in shame, she began to refuse seeing Gao Shaode. Gao Shaode found out that she was pregnant and became indignant. In shame, when she bore a daughter in 562, she threw the infant away, causing the child's death. When Emperor Wucheng found out, he became angry, and he stated,\" Because you killed my daughter, I will kill your son.\" He summoned Gao Shaode and, in her presence, beat him to death with the hilt of a sword. She cried bitterly, and Emperor Wucheng, in anger, stripped her and pounded her. She suffered severe injuries, but eventually recovered, and Emperor Wucheng expelled her from the palace to be a Buddhist nun. In 577, Northern Qi was destroyed by its rival, Northern Zhou. Empress Li followed the Emperor Wucheng's son Gao Wei, the penultimate emperor, to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an, where the members of Northern Qi's imperial Gao clan were slaughtered later that year. After Northern Zhou's own destruction in 581, Emperor Wen of Sui permitted her to leave Chang'an, and she returned to her home in Zhao Commandery. Nothing further is known about her, including the date of her death.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Empress Xu (Ming Dynasty)'s husband?": [

He continued to work as an actor and director until he received a job offer from the Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res studio in 1905. Charles Path\u00e9, who held high hopes for the artistic potential of film as a medium, invited him to join the artistic staff under the direction of Ferdinand Zecca.

The film is regarded as Brooks's best American movie. The actress recounted her memories of working on the film in her essay, \u201cOn Location with Billy Wellman,\u201d which is included in her 1982 book, \"Lulu in Hollywood\". \"Beggars of Life\" was released as both a silent and sound film (the latter with added music, sound effects, and dialogue) in September 1928. The sound sequences, which included train noises and Beery singing a song, are now considered lost. This was Paramount's first feature with spoken dialogue and the first time Beery's voice was recorded for a film, although Beery's spoken dialogue was limited. Today, only the silent version of \"Beggars of Life\" is known to survive. The film is based on \"Outside Looking In\", a stage play by Maxwell Anderson adapted from Jim Tully\u2019s 1924 autobiographical book, \"Beggars of Life\". The play debuted September 7, 1925 at the Greenwich Village Theater. Among those who attended a performance was Charlie Chaplin, who was accompanied by Louise Brooks. Paramount purchased the rights to Tully's book and Anderson's play in early 1928. Arlen and Brooks had appeared together the previous year in \"Rolled Stockings\", which is considered a lost film. Beery and Brooks had appeared together the previous year in \"Now We're in the Air\", which was considered a lost film until 2016 when an incomplete copy was found in Czech Republic. In 2017, the best surviving copy of \"Beggars of Life\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Kino Lorber.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Youngblood Hawke (Film) or Crook'S Tour?": [

The lead character is said to be based on Sofia Kuvshinnikova who although married to another was until 1890 living with the painter Isaac Levitan in the town of Plyos where Sofia was improving her painting skills. Chekhov wrote \"The Grasshopper\" shortly after this time when the couple had returned. Chekhov was a close friend of Sofia's and may have had strong affections for her. The story was a way of criticizing her betrayal, both of him and her innocent husband, and created a small scandal.

On 2 May she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers \u2013 which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard \u2013 and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe. Over the centuries, she has inspired, or been mentioned, in many artistic and cultural works and thereby retained her hold on the popular imagination. She has been called \"the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had\", as she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and declare the English church's independence from Rome.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Anne Of Burgundy's father?": [

V. Sridhar. The film stars Gemini Ganesan and B. Saroja Devi in the lead roles while K. A. Thangavelu, C. R. Vijayakumari, M. Saroja, S. D. Subbulakshmi, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and M. N. Nambiar play supporting roles. A triangular love story, the film is about two close sisters whose lives turn upside down when they both fall in love with the same man. Out of respect, the younger sister decides to sacrifice her love, unknown to the elder sister. \"Kalyana Parisu\" was the directorial debut of Sridhar, who co-produced it with his partners S. Krishnamurthi and T. Govindarajan under Venus Pictures. It also marked the cinematic debut of Chitralaya Gopu, who worked as associate writer, and the debut of A. M. Rajah as a music composer in Tamil. Cinematography was handled by A. Vincent, and editing by N. M. Shankar.\n\"Kalyana Parisu\" was released on 9 April 1959. It was critically acclaimed, particularly for eschewing formulaic Tamil cinema conventions like long dialogues and fixed-point cinematography in favour of short verses with simple words and camera mobility. The film was commercially successful, running for over 25 weeks in theatres and thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. At the 7th National Film Awards, it won the Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Tamil . \"Kalyana Parisu\" emerged a milestone in Tamil cinema, and the breakthrough for Saroja Devi and Rajah. Its success led to Sridhar launching his own production company Chitralaya Pictures, and set the pattern for his later works in which he repeated the motif of the eternal triangle and unrequited love. The comedy subplot written by Gopu involving Thangavelu and M. Saroja gained popularity, and was sold separately on audio cassettes and vinyl records. The film was later remade by Sridhar in Telugu as \"Pelli Kanuka\" (1960) and Hindi as \"Nazrana\" (1961), and in Malayalam by J. Sasikumar as \"Sammanam\" (1975).\n\nQuestion: Which award the composer of film Pataakha won?": [

This was only the third film directed by Dreyer, who later went on to create such classics as \"Vampyr\" (1931) and \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928). The film is structured much like D.W.

The project also featured guest participations of singers Zaine Griff and Linda Jardim. (now: Allan) During 1979 and 1980, Zimmer and Cann were constantly working along as part of the backing band of New Zealand singer Zaine Griff, and were also doing TV presentations as part of the guest line-up of musicians with The Buggles. With Griff, the duo were touring in 1979, played with Griff at Reading '79 Festival and played for his debut album \"Ashes and Diamonds\", released in 1980. In the summer of 1980, Zimmer and Cann established a 'changing project' (not a band) while discussing the possibility of writing and recording an 'adventure' album. The following autumn of 1981 they began work on the project, recording initial material. In March 1983, the forthcoming album was announced as to be called \"Spies\". It consisted of 12 songs, all recorded with synthesizers and computers. Some songs were purely instrumental (Mother Company, Pyramids Of The Reich, Moonlight In Vermont and Eva). The other songs had vocals by (mostly) Zaine Griff and Linda Jardim (Allan), but also Hugo Vereker and French singer Ronny. Some songs are similar to Zaine Griff's songs on the album Figvres (on which Hans Zimmer also contributed instrumental arrangements, keyboards and computers): Stranded, Borderline and Holding On. Other songs were reminiscent of the worldwide hit song \"Video Killed The Radio Star\" by The Buggles - to which Zimmer also contributed: Young & Scientific, 2529 and Movies for Eva, while some songs sound more theatrical and dramatic: The Ball and My Killing Hand. The album was meant to be released in 1983, but that was cancelled. Fans urged the band to release the album and when that did not happen it was later unofficially released as a bootleg. Some parts of their repertoire and BBC Radio One interviews were compiled into an unofficial compilation album called \"Radio One Saturday Live\". A single, \"Holding On\" (a vocal duet between Zaine Griff and Linda Jardim) was officially released on their own label ZiCa Records in autumn 1983, followed by \"Stranded\" in 1985, which came free with issue 19 of In The City magazine. Helden material featured Zaine Griff, Linda Jardim (now Allan), Eddie Maelov (of Gloria Mundi and Eddie And Sunshine), Ronny, Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, among others. After Cann and Zimmer ended the project, both went to collaborate with Spanish new wave band Mecano in their 1984-85 tour. Part of the tour was featured on the unofficial live album , released in 1985. Ultravox's official fan page announced the \"Spies\" album would be released on CD for the first time with bonus material. The exact date was not mentioned, but it had been said to be in plans since 1993.

The film generally traces the history of jazz music from the popularization of Ragtime in the early years of the 20th century to the acceptance of swing as an art form in the late 1930s using music composed by Berlin. The story spans more than two decades from the 1911 release of its name- sake song to some point in time after the 1933 release of\" Heat Wave\", presumably 1938. It stars Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley and Jean Hersholt. Several actual events in the history of jazz are fictionalized and adapted to the story including the tour of Europe by Original Dixieland Jass Band, the global spread of jazz by U.S. soldiers during World War I, and the 1938 Carnegie Hall performance by The Benny Goodman Orchestra. There are no mentions of the primary importance of blacks in creating and playing jazz anywhere in the film. The story was written by Berlin himself, with Kathryn Scola, Richard Sherman( 1905 \u2013 1962) and Lamar Trotti. It was directed by Henry King It is believed by some that both the song and the movie were inspired by a real bandleader, Alexander Constantin Jr. of New Orleans( also known as\" King\" Watzke), and his band, Alexander's Ragtime Band, which was popular c. 1904- 11.\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song Step Into The Light (Myra Song) born?": [

A centenarian, he is one of the last surviving stars of the film industry's Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he made his film debut in \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\" (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck and Lizabeth Scott. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career, he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas is known for his explosive acting style, which he displayed as a criminal defense attorney in \"Town Without Pity\" (1961). Douglas became an international star through positive reception for his leading role as an unscrupulous boxing hero in \"Champion\" (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Other early films include \"Young Man with a Horn\" (1950), playing opposite Lauren Bacall and Doris Day, \"Ace in the Hole\" opposite Jan Sterling (1951), and \"Detective Story\" (1951), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Drama. He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" (1952), opposite Lana Turner, and his third nomination for portraying Vincent van Gogh in \"Lust for Life\" (1956), which landed him a second Golden Globe nomination. In 1955, he established Bryna Productions, which began producing films as varied as \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) and \"Spartacus\" (1960). In those two films he collaborated with the then-relatively-unknown director Stanley Kubrick, taking lead roles in both films. Douglas has been praised for helping to break the Hollywood blacklist by having Dalton Trumbo write \"Spartacus\" with an official on-screen credit. He produced and starred in \" Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962), considered a classic, and \"Seven Days in May\" (1964), opposite Burt Lancaster, with whom he made seven films. In 1963, he starred in the Broadway play \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", a story that he purchased and later gave to his son Michael Douglas, who turned it into an Oscar-winning film. As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas has received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he has written ten novels and memoirs. He is No. 17 on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he has focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life.

Charles was the youngest son of Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I and Ermengarde of Tours. His father divided Middle Francia between his three sons: the eldest, Louis, received Italy and the emperorship; Lothair II received Lotharingia (modern Lorraine, the Low Countries, and Upper Burgundy); and the youngest, Charles, received Lower Burgundy (Arles and Provence). Charles was only a child when his father died; and the governance of his realm was undertaken by his tutor, Count Gerard II of Vienne, whose wife had been a sister-in-law of Emperor Lothar I. Gerard was a vigorous regent, defending the kingdom from the Northmen, who raided up the Rhone as far as Valence. In 860, he ejected them from the Rhone delta. Charles' uncle, Charles the Bald of West Francia, attempted to intervene in Provence in 861. After receiving an appeal for intervention from the Count of Arles, he invaded Provence, but only reached Macon, being restrained by Hincmar of Rheims. Charles of Provence never ruled his realm in anything more than name. It was Gerard, rather than he, who in 858 arranged that should Charles die without children, Provence would revert to Charles' brother Lothair II. However, when Charles died, his elder brother Emperor Louis II also claimed Provence, so the realm was divided between the two: Lothair received the bishoprics of Lyon, Vienne and Grenoble, to be governed by Gerard; Louis II received Arles, Aix and Embrun.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Prince Charles Louis, Duke Of Chartres born?": [

He was known for his energetic and athletic dancing style, his good looks, and the likable characters that he played on screen. Best known today for his performances in films such as \"On the Town\" (1949), \"An American in Paris\" (1951), \"Anchors Aweigh\" (1945)\u2014 for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor\u2014and \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) , he starred in musical films until they fell out of fashion in the late 1950s. He starred in, choreographed, or co-directed some of the most well-regarded musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, debuting with Judy Garland in \"For Me and My Gal\" (1942), and followed by \"Du Barry Was a Lady\" (1943), \"Thousands Cheer\" (1943), \"The Pirate\" (1948), and \"It's Always Fair Weather\" (1955), among others. Later, he starred in two films outside the musical genre: \"Inherit the Wind\" (1960) and \"What a Way to Go!\" (1964). Kelly directed films without a collaborator (in some of which he starred), including \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1969), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. His many innovations transformed the Hollywood musical, and he is credited with almost single-handedly making the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences. Kelly received an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 for his career achievements, the same year \"An American in Paris\" won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He later received lifetime achievement awards in the Kennedy Center Honors (1982) and from the Screen Actors Guild and American Film Institute. In 1999, the American Film Institute also ranked him as the 15th greatest male screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song \u00c9g\u00e9rie (Song) born?": [

He studied under filmmaker Richard Leacock, one of the pioneers of direct cinema and Cin\u00e9ma V\u00e9rit\u00e9 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he graduated with a B.S. in Art and Design. On several of his independent films he is credited both as a director, producer and writer and on occasion as \"Rafael Zelinsky\" and/or \"Rafal Haimovitz\". His early years were spent in Eastern Europe. Born of a Polish father, an engineer and a pioneer in pre-fabricated housing, and mother of Jewish roots, an architect, his childhood was spent in several countries where his father worked for the Ford Foundation. While in grade-school he travelled several times around the world and gained a global perspective, an 8mm camera always at his eye. He was schooled in North America, the Middle East and the Orient. During high-school he attended Stowe School in England where he received the Duke of Edinburgh Award enabling him to make his first documentary film about the temples in Southern India. He went on to graduate from MIT with a Bachelor of Science in Art and Design focusing on the new field of art and technology (participated in projects at the Media Lab), and studied cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary film-making with Richard Leacock. After graduating from MIT he went on to direct several award-winning documentaries, gradually moving towards drama and becoming more and more interested in story-telling. As an independent filmmaker, Zielinski has always generated his own projects either by creating an original story that he was passionate about then collaborating with several screenwriters or adapting works from the theater in collaboration with the respective playwright. On most of the independent films that he directed he also served as his own producer often producing through his own company. His first feature \"Hey Babe\" opened the Taormina Film Festival, and showed at Toronto, Montreal and AFI Film Festival. \"Fun\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received two Special Jury Awards for Acting Achievement and went on to show at the Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver as well as other international film festivals including Sydney, Edinburgh, Munich, Vienna, London, Cambridge, Stockholm, S\u00e3o Paulo, Hawaii, Hamburg, Rimini, Mill Valley, San Jose, Warsaw, Oslo and Wales. The film opened theatrically at the Film Forum in New York and received two nominations for Best Newcomer Performance and Best First Screenplay for IFP Spirit Awards. \"Ginger Ale Afternoon\" also premiered in competition at the Sundance Film Festival and was picked up by Skouras Pictures for domestic theatrical release in the United States. \"Downtown: a street tale\", filmed in New York City, stars Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold, Joey Dedio, and John Savage, and received its world premiere at the AFI Film Festival. His latest two indie films are \"Bohemia\", a love story set in Prague starring Troy Garity (Fonda) (\"BanditsSoldier\u2019s TaleBarbershop\") and Czech actress Klara Issova and \"Age of Kali\", written by Los Angeles playwright John Steppling (playwright), a dark psychological study of decadence and illumination set in Los Angeles. In the mainstream arena he has directed numerous popular genre projects ranging from the Roger Corman financed \"Screwballs\" (which generated three sequels which Zielinski directed as well), to Fox Searchlight \u2019s Frank Peretti written \"Hangman\u2019s Curse\", in which he gave Leighton Meester (\u201cGossip Girl\u201d) her first starring role, as well as numerous TV shows such as \u201cHighlander\u201d and \u201cPoltergeist\u201d. He is currently focusing on three projects: \"Tiger Within\" (written by Gina Wendkos), a story about the relationship between a Holocaust survivor and a teen skin head girl, \"ALieNS\", a large-scale science fiction romance, and \"Bardo\", a life-after-death story based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Zielinski's dream since childhood has been to make films that can reach billions of people, that are both highly entertaining while simultaneously being deep and consciousness expanding \u2013 he is convinced that these three new projects have the potential to achieve these goals.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born first, La Mazurka Del Barone, Della Santa E Del Fico Fiorone or Safe (2012 Film)?": [

She was the sister-in-law of King Edward IV of England and gave birth to several illustrious children. Catherine was the daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and Jacquetta of Luxembourg. When her sister Elizabeth married King Edward IV, the King elevated and promoted many members of the Woodville family. Elizabeth Woodville's household records for 1466/67 indicate that Catherine was being raised in the queen's household. Sometime before the coronation of Elizabeth in May 1465, Catherine was married to Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham; both were still children. A contemporary description of Elizabeth Woodville's coronation relates that Catherine and her husband were carried on squires' shoulders due to their youth. According to Dominic Mancini, Buckingham resented his marriage to a woman of inferior birth. However, the couple had four children:\nIn 1483, Buckingham first allied himself to the Duke of Gloucester, helping him succeed to the throne as King Richard III, and then to Henry Tudor, leading an unsuccessful rebellion in his name. Buckingham was executed for treason on 2 November 1483. After Richard III was defeated by Henry Tudor at Bosworth in 1485, Catherine married the new king's uncle Jasper Tudor on 7 November 1485. After Jasper's death in 1495 - not later than 24 February 1496, - Catherine married Sir Richard Wingfield, who outlived her.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Edward I Of England?": [

Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, \"Two for the Road\", was composed by Mancini, who wrote many notable theme songs for films, including \"Moon River\" for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". He considered \"Two for the Road\" his favourite of all the songs he wrote. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coup\u00e9, VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re-establish the time period after a jump. In one scene of this movie, Audrey Hepburn appears dressed in a shiny black PVC trouser suit designed by Paco Rabanne.

He spent the first 14 years of his life in Japan where his English father was a diplomat. After returning to the US he soon worked for a Minneapolis newspaper. He is best remembered for adapting, with Clemence Randolph, Somerset Maugham's novella \"Rain\" into a 1922 smash hit play starring Jeanne Eagels. He wrote the original play, \"The Shanghai Gesture,\" produced on Broadway in 1926. He excelled at writing plays dealing with Americans in far-off lands, an experience Colton knew firsthand from his early youth in Japan. With these huge successes Colton was lured to Hollywood, primarily MGM, where he wrote intertitles for some silent films and scenarios for others. In the talking film era he wrote numerous screenplays. Three of his stage plays found motion picture production: \"Rain\" (1932); \"The Shanghai Gesture\" (1941); and, posthumously, \"Under Capricorn\" (1949). Colton suffered a stroke in 1945. He died of a second stroke in Gainesville, Texas in 1946.

Tian was born to an influential actor and actress in China. Following a short stint in the military, Tian began his artistic career first as an amateur photographer and then as an assistant cinematographer at the Beijing Agricultural Film Studio. In 1978, he was accepted to the Beijing Film Academy, from which he graduated in 1982, together with classmates Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. The class of 1982 collectively would soon gain fame as the so-called Fifth Generation film movement, with Tian Zhuangzhuang as one of the movement's key figures. Tian's early career was marked both with avant-garde documentary infused films (\"On the Hunting Ground\" (1985), \"The Horse Thief\" (1986)) to more commercial fare ((1991)). In 1991, Tian began work on a quiet epic about one of modern China's darkest moments. This film, \"The Blue Kite\" (1993), would eventually result in Tian's nearly decade long exile from the film industry, an exile he returned from with \"Springtime in a Small Town\" (2001). Throughout the 2000s, Tian Zhuangzhuang returned to the fore of Chinese cinema, directing films like the biopic \"The Go Master\" (2006) and the historical action film \"The Warrior and the Wolf\" (2009). Since his banning after the release of \"The Blue Kite\", Tian has also emerged as a mentor for some of China's newest film talents, and he has helped produce several important films for these new generations of directors.\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the director of film West Of Shanghai?": [

Each of their stories is a dramatization of a short story by a Canadian writer, and is directed by one of the three credited directors. \" How I Met My Husband\", directed by Bailey from the short story by Alice Munro, depicts how Edie's brief teenage romantic fling with a visiting pilot, followed by her persistent but unfulfilled hope that he will write her letters after he leaves, ultimately leads to her meeting and marrying the mailman. ( Edie is played by Margaret Langrick in the flashback.) \" California Aunts\", directed by Mehta from the story by Cynthia Flood, depicts the transformation of Ruth's life as a smalltown librarian after her mother dies and her aunts come to stay with her. \" Guilt\", directed by Suissa from the story by Betty Lambert, depicts Martha taking a new job teaching English in a prison after her husband leaves her for another woman.

Her works included the novels\" Fortunata\"( 1911),\" The Dust of the Road\"( 1913), about her experiences acting in London, and\" A Woman's Man\"( 1919). \" Publishers Weekly\" provided this summary of\" Fortunata\" in 1911: \" Fortunata is the granddaughter of an old Roman Princess and lives in a great Roman palace. When about 18 she begins to have her own way. She spends money lavishly, associates with most unhealthy companions for a young girl. Finally she drifts to England and marries a very rich man and is forced to live with his hum- drum mother and daughters. The Italian wife remains erratic and the end is tragedy.\" H.L. Mencken gave the book a positive review. Patterson's theatre roles included playing the title role in\" Pierrot the Prodigal\"( which played at the Booth Theatre in New York and was produced by Winthrop Ames and Walter Knight), and in the one- act\" Pan in Ambush\", which she wrote. She also acted for a few years in England. Reporting on her in the 1910s places her birth year around 1891, though it is likely she was a few years older as it was not uncommon for actresses to claim a younger age. Attention to her doings dropped off by about 1922, and there is little subsequent mention of her after that time. Patterson was the only daughter of Wilson Patterson and Margaret Sherwood. Her grandfather was author and critic John Neal, and her great- aunt was Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, sister- in- law of Napoleon. She lived her later years in New York City where she died of hepatitis.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the creator of Miss Seventeen?": [

According to the contemporary chronicler Otto of Freising, Henry was \"a valiant man, experienced in the councils of warfortem et exercitatum in bellicis consiliis virum\"). Henry was the eldest son of Duke Ulrich I and Judith, daughter of Margrave Hermann II of Baden. He married Elizabeth, widow of Count Rudolf II of Stade and daughter of Margrave Leopold of Styria, but their marriage was childless. He succeeded his father while still a youth. In 1147 his rich uncle, Count Bernard of Trixen, bequeathed his allods and his \"ministeriales\" (high-status serfs) in Carinthia and in the Styrian \"Mark an der Drau\" to Margrave Ottokar III of Styria. In 1151 another uncle, Hermann III of Baden, was invested with the march of Verona, which had been held by the dukes of Carinthia since 976. Henry is not known to have objected to the loss of this large territory in northern Italy. In 1158 Bishop Roman I of Gurk granted the bailiwick (secular protection) of his diocese to Henry, but this was a small gain for a prince whose territory was dominated by estates with non-resident lords both ecclesiastical and secular. Henry took part in the wars of the Emperor Frederick I in northern Italy in 1154\u201355 and 1158\u201360. Otto of Freising lists him among the most distinguished who returned home with the emperor's permission in mid-1155. Otto's continuator, Rahewin, reports that during the 1158 campaign, Henry and Duke Henry II of Austria were given command of the Hungarian contingent of 600 archers, with their \"counts and barons\", which marched through the Val Canale into the march of Verona, the route known as the \"via Canalis\". Henry was a member of the embassy Frederick sent to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I in 1160\u201361. Henry was probably sent because his brother, Margrave Engelbert III of Istria was married to Matilda of Sulzbach, a sister of Manuel's wife, the Empress Irene. While returning, Henry drowned in the mouth of the Tagliamento river. His body was buried in the abbey of Rosazzo. He was succeeded by his brother, Hermann II.\n\nQuestion: Where did the composer of film Henry V (1944 Film) die?": [

Nicknamed the\" Father of Rock and Roll\", Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as\" Maybellene\"( 1955),\" Roll Over Beethoven\"( 1956),\" Rock and Roll Music\"( 1957) and\" Johnny B. Goode\"( 1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle- class African- American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T- Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded\" Maybellene\" \u2014 Berry's adaptation of the country song\" Ida Red\" \u2014 which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on\" Billboard\" magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. However, he was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act\u2014he had transported a 14- year- old girl across state lines. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including\" No Particular Place to GoYou Never Can Tell\", and\" Nadine\". But these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. However, in 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of\" My Ding- a- Ling\" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four- month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion. Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having\" laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance.\" Berry is included in several of\" Rolling Stone\" magazine's\" greatest of all time\" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry's:\" Johnny B. GoodeMaybellene\", and\" Rock and Roll Music\". Berry's\" Johnny B.

It was critically acclaimed and became an unexpected flop at the box office. However over the years, the film has been appreciated by the audiences in its screening in television and has gained a cult following over the years. Rajesh Khanna and Raj Kapoor starred in this movie, set in 1944\u20131947. \"Naukri\"s basic idea is based on the 1955 Tamil film \"Mudhal Thethi\", starring Sivaji Ganeshan and Anjali Devi. The other inspiration for this film was \"It's a Wonderful Life\", produced and directed by Frank Capra. The story features a person getting help of an angel after his death. However, the story and treatment in this film are completely different form both of these films. The God-sent person makes the hero realize that when he was alive he was so important and loved by all around him but he couldn\u2019t recognize it. Rajesh Khanna plays the man who meets the angel Raj Kapoor, after he commits suicide. The film was not well publicized before its release and being released at a time when multi-star films ruled the roost, this classic was a box office failure. However, over the years it has been appreciated by audiences. In the Bollywood Guide Collections, critics gave the film 4 stars of 5. The idea of an angel helping a dead person in realizing his significance on earth was also adopted in the 2005 film \"Vaah!

The band originally formed in Hertfordshire in late 1965 as The Little People, and comprised Angus Shirley( lead guitar), Peter\" Dino\" Dines( organ, vocals), Bob Argent( bass), and Angus' younger brother Jerry Shirley( drums). They began by playing covers of American R&B records, and emulated the music of their heroes, The Small Faces. After they supported the latter band on a local bill, Steve Marriott became their mentor, and persuaded Andrew Loog Oldham of Immediate Records to sign them in early 1967. Marriott wanted them to change their name to The Nice, but Oldham insisted on them using the name The Apostolic Intervention, giving the name The Nice to another band instead. Marriott offered the band a song that he and Ronnie Lane had written,\" Tell Me( Have You Ever Seen Me)\", producing their single and playing bass on the record in preference to Bob Argent. The record failed to make the charts, and the song was soon recorded by The Small Faces themselves on their album\" Small Faces\"( issued in the US in a different form as\" There are But Four Small Faces\"). Further attempts at recording The Apostolic Intervention were unsuccessful, and the band split up before the end of 1967. Dines and Jerry Shirley joined Tim Renwick in a band known variously as Little Women and the Wages of Sin. Dines later joined the Keef Hartley Band and T. Rex, while Shirley played sessions before joining Steve Marriott in Humble Pie in 1969. \" Tell Me( Have You Ever Seen Me)\" by The Apostolic Intervention has subsequently featured on several compilations of British psychedelic music, and has been described as\" as solid a single as Immediate released from a new act in its history, catchy and filled with hooks, as well as showing off some superb playing.\"\n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song I See You (Theme From Avatar) born?": [

He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary \"Fragmentary Annals of Ireland\" as Gofraid, and brother of Auisle and \u00cdmar, the latter of whom founded the U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The Irish Annals title Amla\u00edb, \u00cdmar and Auisle \"kings of the foreigners\". Modern scholars use the title \"kings of Dublin\" after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. The epithet \"Conung\" is derived from the Old Norse \"konungr\" and simply means \"king\". Some scholars consider Amla\u00edb to be identical to Olaf the White, a Viking sea-king who features in the \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\" and other Icelandic sagas. During the late 850s and early 860s Amla\u00edb was involved in a protracted conflict with M\u00e1el Sechnaill, overking of the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of Munster and its resources. Amla\u00edb allied successively with Cerball, King of Ossory and\n\u00c1ed Findliath, overking of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill against M\u00e1el Sechnaill. M\u00e1el Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this Amla\u00edb and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. In later years Amla\u00edb conducted extensive raids in Scotland, though these were interrupted by a war in 868 against his former ally \u00c1ed Findliath when several Viking longphorts along the northern coast were razed. Amla\u00edb disappears from contemporary annals in 871. Later accounts say he returned to Lochlann to aid his father in a war, and the \"Pictish Chronicle\" says he died in battle against Constantine I of Scotland. This event is usually dated to 874.\n\nQuestion: Who is Colg\u00fa Mac Fa\u00edlbe Flaind's uncle?": [

He was a titular king of Kartli in 1709. In 1675, Levan was confirmed as a \"janisin\" (regent) of Kartli during the absence of his reigning brother, George XI (Gurgin Khan), at the Persian military service in Afghanistan. Summoned to Isfahan in 1677, he had to accept Islam and take the name Shah-Quli Khan. Thereafter he was appointed as naib of Kerman, Iran, and, as a commander of Georgian auxiliary forces, he secured the eastern provinces of the Persian empire from the rebellious Baluchi tribesmen from 1698 to 1701. For a short time in 1703, he was again a janisin for his absent brother in Kartli. As a reward for his military service the shah Husayn made Levan, in 1703, a \"divanbeg\" (chief justice) of Persia, and his son, Khusrau Khan, \"darugha\" (i.e., prefect) of Isfahan. During his governance in Kartli, he patronised Catholic missioners in the Caucasus. He also encouraged scholarly activities in Georgia, and helped his cousin, Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, to create a Georgian dictionary, which is still widely used in Georgia. Although officially a convert to Islam, Levan covertly remained Christian and composed the prayers to St John the Baptist, St Peter, St Paul and other Christian saints.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Gjon Kastrioti Ii's father?": [

While \"Apocalypto\" is set during the terminal post-classic period of Maya civilization, the central pyramid of the film comes from the classic period, which ended in A.D. 900, such as those found in the Postclassic sites of Muyil, Coba, and others in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where later cities are built around earlier pyramids. The temples are in the shape of those of Tikal in the central lowlands classic style but decorated with the Puuc style elements of the northwest Yucat\u00e1n centuries later. Richard D. Hansen comments, \"There was nothing in the post-classic period that would match the size and majesty of that pyramid in the film. But Gibson ... was trying to depict opulence, wealth, consumption of resources.\" The mural in the arched walkway combined elements from the Maya codices, the Bonampak murals (over 700 years earlier than the film's setting), and the San Bartolo murals (some 1500 years earlier than the film's setting).\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Extreme Ops or Puberun?": [

Yanni continues to use the musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, \"Live at the Acropolis,\" yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's Taj Mahal, China's Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa, Russia's Kremlin, Puerto Rico's El Morro castle, Lebanon's ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia's Roman Theatre of Carthage, India's Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel. At least sixteen of Yanni's albums have peaked at No. 1 in \"Billboard'sTop New Age Album\" category, and two albums (\"Dare to Dream\" and \"In My Time\") received Grammy Award nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 Yanni had performed live in concert before more than 5 million people and had accumulated more than 40 platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling over 25 million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni's compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning British Airways television commercial. Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a \"true global artist\" and his music is said to reflect his \"one world, one people\" philosophy.\n\nQuestion: Where was the keyboardist of Xyz (English Band) born?": [

At the time of independence, Mozambique lacked a national television network, so a newsreel program was the only way to reach the population through visual media. The first cultural act of President Machel \u2019s government was the establishment of the Kuxa Kanema weekly newsreel program. The newsreels were shown in Mozambique \u2019s relatively few cinemas in the 35 mm format. In the rural areas, mobile units provided by the Soviet Union offered the newsreels in the 16 mm format. Machel's government, however, did not finance or encourage the creation of a film industry designed strictly for entertainment value. The film also details the struggle to get INC up and running: Mozambique had no film industry or film schools( Brazilian and Cuban instructors were flown in to offer on- the- spot educational training). The resulting newsreels were shot in black- in- white because color film was too expensive. Machel's death in an airplane crash in 1986, coupled with guerrilla attacks launched by the apartheid governments of South Africa and Rhodesia that destabilized Mozambique to the point of civil war, helped to kill this program. Many of the cinemas in the cities were damaged in the civil war, while the rural presentations of Kuxa Kanema were cancelled due to the lack of safe passage along rural roads. By the end of the conflict, national television had been established and there was no call for a theatrical newsreel presentation. \" Kuxa Kanema: The Birth of Cinema\" offers clips of rarely seen footage from the INC films. It also looks into the offer by French filmmaker Jean- Luc Godard to create a national independent television network. \" Kuxa Kanema: The Birth of Cinema\" has played in film festivals and has been released on DVD.\n\nQuestion: Which one was established first, Besix or Circus Herman Renz?": [

He was the youngest grandson of Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom. Gonzalo was born in Madrid. He was baptized with the names \"Gonzalo Manuel Mar\u00eda Bernardo Narciso Alfonso Mauricio\". He received his final name in honor of his uncle, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, who was killed in World War I shortly before Gonzalo's baptism. The infante was educated privately. Because he inherited hemophilia from his mother's family (a fact not widely known in Spain during his life), he suffered some ill health, although he was an active sportsman. He held the rank of a private in the Engineering Corps of the Spanish Army. In 1927 he was made the 1,166th Knight of the Spanish branch of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In May 1924, nine-year-old Gonzalo inaugurated the Estadio Chamart\u00edn, the new football stadium for Real Madrid C.F., kicking the ball of honour and announcing \"\u00a1Hala Madrid!.\" On 14 April 1931 Gonzalo accompanied his mother into exile. He studied Engineering at the Catholic University of Leuven, instead of at the University of Madrid as originally planned for him. In August 1934 Gonzalo was spending the summer holidays with his family at the villa of Count Ladislaus de Hoyos at P\u00f6rtschach am W\u00f6rthersee in Austria. On the evening of 11 August, Gonzalo and his sister Infanta Beatriz were driving from Klagenfurt to P\u00f6rtschach. Near Krumpendorf, Beatriz, who was driving, was forced to swerve to avoid a cyclist (the retired jockey Baron Neimans). The car crashed into a wall. Neither Gonzalo nor Beatriz appeared badly hurt, and so they returned to their villa. Several hours later it became clear that Gonzalo had severe abdominal bleeding. Because he had a weak heart, an operation was ruled out. He died two days later. He was the king and queen's second child to die. Gonzalo was buried in the graveyard at P\u00f6rtschach.

In 2008, Egoyan received the Dan David Prize for\" Creative Rendering of the Past\". Egoyan later received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest royal honour in the performing arts, in 2015.

His throne name, Neferkare (\"Nefer-ka-Re\"), means \"Beautiful is the Ka of Re\". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks\u2014the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II\u2014were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: \"King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II\". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Pareherwenemef's mother?": [

Laz\u0103r was born in Bucharest in 1938. She graduated from the Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography( where she also obtained a degree in psychology, which she practiced until 1994, dealing mainly in couple's therapy) and subsequently played roles in Romanian theatre[ notably a run of\" Right You Are( if you think so)\" in 1963- 64]. Despite being a Romanian baroness, at 26, she fled her home country to escape anti-Semetic persecution and eventually settled in Italy in 1965. She managed to learn the Italian language in only a few weeks and had planned to move on to the United States or Israel, but became entranced with Rome. There, she met and married Italian actor Adolfo Celi with whom she had two children, director Leonardo Celi and actress Alessandra Celi. She made her screen debut as Marlon Brando's deceased wife in Bernardo Bertolucci's\" Last Tango in Paris\"( 1972), and also appeared in some of the director's subsequent films,\" La Luna\"( 1979),\" The Sheltering Sky\"( 1990), and\" Besieged\"( 1998). Laz\u0103r is probably best known internationally for her role as the demonic Mater Tenebrarum in Dario Argento's\" Inferno\"( 1980), as well as the ill- fated Martha in Lucio Fulci's\" The Beyond\"( 1981). She later appeared in Argento's\" The Stendhal Syndrome\"( 1996) in a role that was removed from the North American version( though she is still billed in the end credits). Her other films included Michelangelo Antonioni's\" Identification of a Woman\"( 1982),\" Towards Evening\"( 1990),\" The Prince's Manuscript\"( 2000) and\" Ginostra\"( 2002). Her last role was that of the main character Lorenzo's loving grandmother in Bertolucci's\" Me and You\"( 2012). Veronica Laz\u0103r was a renowned woman of culture and a cultural ambassador between Italian and Romanian cinema( the latter, a position she began in 1989). She was a linguistic interpreter and was seen as a symbolic figure with a protective aura by her countrymen in both Italy and Romania. She was also president of the Itaro Art Foundation and was instrumental in its 2007 retrospective on Romanian cinema held in Rome and Pisa. She was heavily involved with the acting students at Teatro Valle and often would cook meals for the them at her home and bring them to the theatre. The students there nicknamed her\" Nonna Veronica.\" Laz\u0103r also coordinated the construction of a hospital in Mali over the course of a year, on orders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When she returned to Italy, she brought with her African fabrics, statues, and carpets, many of which were still in her home when she died. Laz\u0103r loved to play cards, share with her friends, and had a special affinity for the sea. At her funeral, she wanted her 18- year- old niece, a career musician already, to play the theme from\" Schindler's List\" throughout the Jewish cemetery in Prima Porta where she was laid to rest. \" If someone wants to take a shower, I'll make my home available.\" -- Veronica Laz\u0103r\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died later, Bloody Moon or The House Of Pulcini?": [

P. Nagarajan. The film features Sivaji Ganesan, Savitri, and K. B. Sundarambal in the lead roles, with T. S. Balaiah, R. Muthuraman, Nagesh, T. R. Mahalingam, K. Sarangkapani, Devika, Manorama, and Nagarajan in supporting roles. K. V. Mahadevan composed the film's soundtrack and score, and Kannadasan and Sankaradas Swamigal wrote the song lyrics. Co-produced by A. M. Shahul Hameed, it was inspired by the \"Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam\": a collection of sixty-four Shaivite devotional, epic stories, written in the 16th century by Paranjothi Munivar, which record the actions (and antics) of Shiva on Earth in a number of disguises to test his devotees. \"Thiruvilaiyadal\" depicts four of the stories. The first is about the poets Dharumi and Nakkeerar; the second concerns Dhatchayini. The third recounts how Shiva's future wife, Parvati, is born as a fisherwoman; Shiva, in the guise of a fisherman, finds and marries her. The fourth story is about the singers Banabhathirar and Hemanatha Bhagavathar. The soundtrack was praised, and the songs \"Pazham NeeyappaOru Naal PodhumaIsai Thamizh\" and \"Paattum Naane\" became popular with the Tamil diaspora. \"Thiruvilaiyadal\" was released on 31 July 1965 to critical praise for its screenplay, dialogue, direction, music and the performances of Ganesan, Nagesh and Balaiah. The film was a commercial success, running for over twenty-five weeks in several theatres and becoming a silver jubilee film. It was also responsible for a resurgence in mythological cinema, since it was released when Tamil cinema was primarily producing social films. \"Thiruvilaiyadal\" received the Certificate of Merit for the Second-Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 13th National Film Awards and the Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Tamil. A digitally-restored version was released in September 2012, and was also a commercial success.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Vadakakku Oru Hridayam or The $1,000,000 Reward?": [

He also published under the pseudonym Rusmir. He was born as Franc Albrecht in the Upper Carniolan town of Kamnik in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He grew up in a liberal milieu, but he later came closer to more leftist views. He studied at the University of Vienna and became a literary critic and a neo-romantic poet. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Albreht was editor of the liberal literary magazine \"Ljubljanski zvon\". After the crisis of the journal in 1932, which emerged from different interpretations of Slovene identity and attitudes towards the centralist policies in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Albreht left the journal and established, together with the literary critic Josip Vidmar and author Ferdo Kozak, a new magazine called \"SodobnostModernity\"). Under Albreht, Vidmar and Kozak, the new magazine became the foremost progressive journal in Slovenia, in which also many Marxists and Communists could publish their articles under pseudonyms. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Albreht became an active member of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People in Ljubljana. He was imprisoned by Italian fascist authorities on a number of occasions. In 1944, the Nazis sent him to Dachau concentration camp. Soon after the liberation from Nazi occupation and the establishment of the Communist regime in Yugoslavia in 1945, he was appointed mayor of Ljubljana. He served in that office between 1945 and 1948. In 1948, he was dismissed and shortly imprisoned under the suspicion of anti-Communist activity. He was married to the poet Vera Albreht.

In addition to the title, \"Bed and Sofa\" it was also released outside of the Soviet Union under the alternate titles of \"Three in a CellarOld Dovecots\", and \"Cellars of Moscow\". The film gets its Russian title from the street on which the main characters live, Third Meshchanskaia Street. Directed by Abram Room and written by Room and Viktor Shklovsky, the film starred Nikolai Batalov as the husband, Kolia, Lyudmila Semyonova as the wife, Liuda, and Vladimir Fogel as the friend, Volodia. Billed as a satire and comedy, \"Bed and Sofa\" nonetheless portrayed the realities of the Moscow working poor, while also dealing with starkly sexual situations, such as polygamy and abortion. It was originally banned in both the United States and Europe due to those stark sexual situations. The screenplay was supposedly based on the true love story of the acclaimed Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky who lived with his \"muse\" Lilya Brik and her husband Osip Brik for some years. The characters themselves also resembled the trio, with Vladimir Fogel as Mayakovsky, Lyudmila Semyonova as Lilya and Nikolai Batalov as Osip Brik. The parallels were so obvious that some critics and associates accused Viktor Shklovsky of indelicacy and gossiping. Shklovsky himself never openly admitted it, yet in his diaries he mentions that during the work on the screenplay they \u00abwere living next to Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik\u00bb, which is an obvious hint. While movies made in the USSR would soon be regulated to the ideals of Soviet realism, some films at this time were able to present starker themes. Even so, \"Bed and Sofa\" was controversial at the time of release in the Soviet Union, due to its focus on human relationships, while the state and the party are almost completely disregarded. In fact, at one point Kolya even declines to go to a Party meeting. In addition, the film's resolution is ambiguous and comes about without any input from the collective. However, it is now considered a landmark film because of humor, naturalism, and its sympathetic portrayal of the woman.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, Patrik L\u00e1cha or Brad Booth?": [

Pedro de los R\u00edos was named governor of Castilla del Oro in May 1526 and took charge of the post in July of the same year. He later moved to Nicaragua and earned the trust of its administrators who also bestowed him the governorship. However, the governor of Honduras Diego L\u00f3pez de Salcedo y Rodr\u00edguez soon arrived in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, and obliged R\u00edos to abandon the post and return to Castilla del Oro. After several years of mishandling the governorship of Castilla del Oro, he was removed from the post and succeeded by Antonio de la Gama in August 1529. His duties done in Central America, he decided to join Francisco Pizarro in the newly discovered territory of Peru. Once there, he arrived in the Incan capital of Cuzco and was registered among its first Spanish settlers. R\u00edos sided with Pizarro's forces against initial unsuccessful attempts by the Spanish Crown to regain Peru.

She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, where she was a student of Ferdinand Alqui\u00e9, and the University of Helsinki, where she was a student of Ingmar P\u00f6rn and Georg Henrik von Wright. In the 1980s she taught at the University of Pittsburgh in the USA and in Helsinki before being named professor of philosophy at Uppsala University in 1997. In her critically received book on Descartes (2003), Alanen goes beyond mere history, drawing out the historical antecedents and the intellectual evolution of Descartes' thinking about the mind, showing how his emphasis on the embodiment of the mind has implications far more complex and interesting than the usual dualist account associated with his thinking suggests. Lilli Alanen is a member of the industrialist Ahlstr\u00f6m family. Her mother was Finnish art collector and patron of the arts Maire Gullichsen and her father the industrialist Harry Gullichsen. Her siblings are the renowned Finnish architect Kristian Gullichsen and Johan Gullichsen, a professor of engineering. The family home at Noormarkku near Pori is the world-famous modernist house Villa Mairea designed by architect Alvar Aalto. In 1964 she married the Finnish artist Sakari Alanen (b. 1940), and they have three children. They were divorced in 1989.

He is the author of several well- known historical novels, including:\" Boves, el Urogallo\"( 1972),\" Los Amos del Valle\"( 1979) and\" La Luna de Fausto\"( 1983). He was the son of Francisco Herrera Guerrero and Mar\u00eda Luisa Luque Carvallo. In 1956, he married to Maria Margarita Ter\u00e1n Austria, with whom he had five children. Herrera Luque studied in the Central University of Venezuela( UCV) and later at the University of Salamanca( 1952), where he obtained his title of physician. In Madrid he specialized in psychiatry, a field on which he wrote several scientific papers. His PhD thesis served as basis for his book:\" Los Viajeros de Indias\"( 1961), about the psychopathic loads left on the Venezuelan population by the Spanish conquistadors. His interest in understanding the origins of the personalities of Latin America people took him to the study of heritage and genetics. Herrera Luque founded the department of psychiatry of the UCV, becoming full professor. He was appointed ambassador of Venezuela in Mexico in the mid-1970s. As writer and novelist, his historical work is based on accurate and documented research. His late books:\" Los Cuatro reyes de la barajaBol\u00edvar en vivo1998\" and\" El Vuelo del Alcatraz\", were published posthumously. During the final years of his life and after his death his works gained great popularity, making him one of the best- selling writers of Venezuela. His success resulted from the combination of typical Venezuelan stories with historical facts; in his works, Herrera Luque looked beyond the official history of the country and created a parallel narrative to it. Francisco Herrera Luque died in Caracas from a heart attack on 15 April 1991. In 1992 the Francisco Herrera Luque Foundation was created. In 2010 the novel\" Boves, el Urogallo\", was adapted into a film by director Luis Alberto Lamata, with the title of\" Taita Boves\".\n\nQuestion: Where did Roberto Civita's father die?": [

Reilly) John Richard Reilly (June 4, 1928 \u2013 October 12, 2008) was an adviser to a number of Democratic Party presidents and presidential candidates. Reilly was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on June 4, 1928, as the only child of William and Stella Reilly. He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Iowa in 1952 and was granted a law degree in 1955. After his graduation from law school, Reilly was hired as an attorney working in the antitrust division of the United States Department of Justice. He joined John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and was hired as an aide by Attorney General of the United States Robert F. Kennedy. Reilly was given the assignment by the Kennedy administration to attend the speech delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr. on August 28, 1963, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as part of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Roger Mudd reported that Reilly told him that he was positioned on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a switch that would be used to cut off Dr. King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech \"if the rhetoric got too inflammatory\". A turntable with a 78-rpm recording of Mahalia Jackson's \"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\" was on standby, having been selected in advance by Reilly. As a member of the Federal Trade Commission in June 1964, Reilly was one of three commissioners who voted in the majority to require that cigarette manufacturers \"clearly and prominently\" place a warning on packages of cigarettes effective January 1, 1965, stating that smoking is dangerous to health, in line with the warning issued by a special committee formed by the Surgeon General of the United States Luther Leonidas Terry. The same warning would be required in all cigarette advertising effective July 1, 1965. After leaving the FTC in 1967, Reilly became a partner with the Washington, D.C., law firm of Pierson, Ball & Dowd, and was founding partner in 1972 of the Washington, D.C. office of Winston & Strawn LLP, a firm based in Chicago.

Muskie in 1972, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Joseph Biden in 1988.

Before her marriage to Frank Benson, she was known by the stage name Constance Featherstonhaugh, pronounced \"Fanshaw\" . Born in British India into a military family, and christened Gertrude Constance Cockburn Samwell , she took to the stage under the name of Featherstonhaugh, which was the middle name of her father, Morshead Featherstonhaugh Samwell. She married the actor Frank Benson in 1886, and they had two children, Eric William (1887-1916), killed at the battle of the Somme, and Brynhild Lucy (1888\u20131974). When Benson played Cleopatra in 1898, reviewers were astonished by her \"terrible rage\", one commenting that she treated a struck-down messenger so violently that only the intervention of Charmian had saved his life. One critic later claimed that \"Benson and his companies never shook off the aura of amateurism\", and that some of the parts Constance Benson had played \"owed more to her husband's loyalty than to her talent\". As an actress, Constance Benson worked in the theatre, but in 1911 she also appeared in leading roles in four silent films, all adaptations of William Shakespeare plays: \"Richard IIIJulius CaesarMacbeth\", and \"The Taming of the Shrew\". In 1916 Constance became Lady Benson. After F. R. Benson's love affair with the young actress Genevieve Townsend (d. 1927), the couple separated but did not divorce, and in 1940 Benson attended her husband's funeral as his widow. During the First World War, in which her son Eric was killed, Benson worked in a canteen for soldiers in France. In 1917 her daughter Brynhild married firstly Charles Chalmers, in 1931 secondly Harold G. Janion, and in 1951 thirdly Richard C. Kelly. In the 1920s, Benson became a writer, and her published books are her autobiography \"Mainly Players\" (1926); two novels, \"The Chimera\" (1928), about \"an ice-cold, egotistical, twenty-eight-year-old artist\", with a frustrated wife, and \"Cuckoo Oats\" (1929). She also wrote an acting manual and in the 1920s began a drama school, at which one of her students was Elvira Mullens, later Elvira Barney. Benson's autobiography \" Mainly Players\" has an introduction by Arthur Machen, who had been a member of the Benson company from 1901 to 1909.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first out of Misaele Draunibaka and Ross Clark?": [

We have known him from a colophon in the Serbian recension of the Slavonic Josephus,\" The History of the Jewish War\". He transcribed and translated the Slavonic Josephus into Serbian vernacular at Karyes, the administrative center of Mount Athos, in 1585. In addition, the Hilandar Monastery has preserved five petitions that hieromonk Grigorije in his frequent travels throughout Europe delivered to nobleman Nikita Romanov( the grandfather of the future tsar Michael of Russia) in April 1586; Andrej Jakovlevi\u0107( two petitions written before 1582); Polish king Stephen Bathory; and Duke Andrey Kurbsky. Also, these documents have been published by the Moscow Main Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. According to records Grigorije Vasilije served as abbot of Hilandar in 1583, and multiple other occasions between 1588 and 1591 and continually from 1591 to 1598. He also traveled between the far- flung Athonite methos( including Imperial Russia) and their parent establishments on regular errands as alms collecting, property administration and Diplomatic missions on behalf of the secular and spiritual leaders where he stayed at the Moscow courts of Ivan the Terrible and Dionysius, Metropolitan of Moscow and their successors Fedor I of Russia and Patriarch Job of Moscow, years later. Upon his return voyage, Grogorije Vasilije traveled to Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in Ottoman- occupied Serbia to see his master Gerasim I and later the patriarch's successor Savatije I before resuming his trip back to Karyes, Mount Athos. Ivan the Terrible's generosity shown to Serbian itinerant monk Grigorije and other Athonite monks accompanying him could be explained by the tsar \u2019s own recognition of his Serbian royal lineage( through his mother) and the desire to strengthen relations between Russia and Serbia. Author Sreten Petkovi\u0107 in\" The Cultural Heritage of Serbia\" attributes the presence of the 1564 fresco of Prince Lazar of Serbia in the Cathedral of the Archangel of the Moscow Kremlin to Tsar Ivan \u2019s attachment to his Serbian roots.

By means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate claim to the English throne than King Henry VII himself through the first two wives of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster: Blanche of Lancaster and Constance of Castile. In contrast, Henry VII was the descendant of Gaunt's third marriage to Katherine Swynford, whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimised after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimised, were barred from inheriting the English throne, a stricture that was ignored in later generations. Because of Henry's descent through illegitimate children barred from succession to the English throne, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all European kingdoms. At the time, the House of Trast\u00e1mara was the most prestigious in Europe, due to the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon's ancestry. It would have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne. The two were married by proxy on 19 May 1499 and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen, when it was decided that they were old enough to be married.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Arthur Gore, 1St Earl Of Arran?": [

July 6, 1744) \u2013 November 23, 1814) was an American politician and diplomat. As a Democratic-Republican he served as the fifth vice president of the United States under President James Madison from March 1813 until his death in November 1814. The phenomenon of gerrymandering was named after him. Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gerry vocally opposed British colonial policy in the 1760s, and was active in the early stages of organizing the resistance in the American Revolutionary War. Elected to the Second Continental Congress, Gerry signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. He was one of three men who attended the Constitutional Convention in 1787 who refused to sign the United States Constitution because it did not then include a Bill of Rights. After its ratification he was elected to the inaugural United States Congress, where he was actively involved in drafting and passage of the Bill of Rights as an advocate of individual and state liberties. Gerry was at first opposed to the idea of political parties, and cultivated enduring friendships on both sides of the political divide between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. He was a member of a diplomatic delegation to France that was treated poorly in the XYZ Affair, in which Federalists held him responsible for a breakdown in negotiations. Gerry thereafter became a Democratic-Republican, running unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts several times before winning the office in 1810. During his second term, the legislature approved new state senate districts that led to the coining of the word \"gerrymander\"; he lost the next election, although the state senate remained Democratic-Republican. Chosen by Madison as his vice presidential candidate in 1812, Gerry was elected, but died a year and a half into his term. He is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence who is buried in Washington, DC.\n\nQuestion: Who died earlier, Chiang Chung-Ling or George Andreadis?": [

He was the first jazz talent to emerge from Europe and remains the most significant. With violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli, Reinhardt formed the Paris-based Quintette du Hot Club de France in 1934. The group was among the first to play jazz that featured the guitar as a lead instrument. Reinhardt recorded in France with many visiting American musicians, including Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and briefly toured the United States with Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1946. He died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 43. Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become standards within gypsy jazz, including \"Minor SwingDaphneBellevilleDjangologySwing '42\", and \"Nuages\". Jazz guitarist Frank Vignola claims that nearly every major popular-music guitarist in the world has been influenced by Reinhardt. Over the last few decades, annual Django festivals have been held throughout Europe and the U.S., and a biography has been written about his life. In February 2017, the Berlin International Film Festival held the world premiere of the French film, \"Django\".\n\nQuestion: What is the cause of death of performer of song Blues Run The Game?": [

Although this is one of the lesser known songs from\" Born to RunNight\" has become somewhat of a stage favorite for the E Street Band. The song was not immediately played during the 1975 portions of the Born to Run Tour, but later became a frequent set- opener, especially during the 1976 and 1977 legs. It was still sometimes being used as an opening song decades later during the 2007 \u2013 2008 Magic Tour. The mood of the music is mostly exciting as are the lyrics which have a romantic quality as well. The music is propelled by Gary Tallent's bass. It is similar to the album's famous title track in that both songs deal with men and their fast cars. The lyrics mostly describe the central character as a blue collar worker who, after working a full day, runs off into the night to go drag racing and search for the love of a woman. For the protagonist, the only freedom and joy comes when he is on the highway, and he lives for the nights and weekends when he can escape work. Like a couple of other songs on\" Born to RunTenth Avenue Freeze- Out\" and\" She's the One\", the story of the relationship is told in a flashback. The desperation and darkness of the lyrics makes a strong contrast with some of the other songs on the\" Born to Run\" album, which glorify night life. Although\" Night\" and\" Born to Run\" show Springsteen beginning to deal seriously with blue collar protagonists, he would develop the theme further on his next album,\" Darkness on the Edge of Town\", in which he would portray additional facets of blue collar working life on songs such as\" Badlands Adam Raised a Cain The Promised LandProve It All Night\" and, especially,\" Factory\". This central theme would later be explored on\" The River\", especially in the song\" Out in the Street\", and became a focus of Springsteen's post-\" Darkness on the Edge of Town\" songwriting dealing with working class characters leading dead- end lives. In 1979, it was released as the B-side of the\" Rosalita( Come Out Tonight)\" single in Europe. The song was recorded in a style similar to the album's title track\" Born to Run\". Springsteen wanted to emulate record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique where multiple instruments played at the same time with their sounds bleeding into each other's microphones. The result is a\" wash\" of sound where some individual instruments are difficult to define, yet blend in to create a dense orchestral ambiance.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Thru Your Phone?": [

In the stage version, it is sung at the start of Act 2, and in the 1948 original Broadway production, it was sung by Lorenzo Fuller (as Paul) and Eddie Sledge and Fred Davis (as the specialty dancers), leading the full company. In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred's new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions (according to general opinion); in the stage version, the song represents the company of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allowed the audience to see Lois's fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line ' According to the Kinsey report' (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to ' According to the latest report'.

Born Ellis O'Neill , she was the third daughter of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone the leading Gaelic figure in Ireland. Her mother was Hugh's fourth wife, Catherine Magennis, daughter of Sir Hugh Magennis. Her marriage to Randal MacDonnell was a dynastic match that brought Tyrone into alliance with the MacDonnells, the dominant family in northern County Antrim who also had strong connections in Scotland. Tyrone's other children made similar marriages with leading families across Ulster. During Tyrone's Rebellion (1594-1603) Randal supported his father-in-law, but in the closing stages of the conflict he changed sides. He was eventually rewarded for this by the Crown when he was made Earl of Antrim and his wife thereby became a Countess. Despite being a Gaelic Catholic, Randal was a strong supporter of settling Scottish Protestants along the Eastern Ulster coastline, anticipating the Ulster Plantation which took place in six of the more western counties of the province. Ellis's husband became the most senior Gaelic aristocrat in Ulster following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, when her father fled into exile in Continental Europe. Her husband died in 1636. Ellis outlived him by many years, dying in 1665.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Renaud Iii, Count Of Soissons?": [

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed \"The Wages of Fear\" and \"Les Diaboliques\", which are critically recognized as among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including \"The Mystery of Picasso\", which was declared a national treasure by the government of France. Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film \"Le Corbeau\" drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947. After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including \"Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\". After the release of his comedy film \"Miquette et sa m\u00e8re\", Clouzot married V\u00e9ra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for \"The Wages of Fear\" and \"Les Diaboliques\". Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9\", Clouzot's wife V\u00e9ra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born later, Fugitive Rage or Neapolitan Carousel?": [

The film is based on the book\" Le Dernier Mitterrand\" by Georges- Marc Benamou. Benamou had talked with and accompanied Mitterrand for the last 1,000 days of his presidency. Benamou worked for a small circulation magazine called\" Globe\"- a magazine for\" champagne socialistsla gauche caviar\" in the French idiom. It is not clear why Mitterrand chose Benamou but the journalist has said they got on well and discussed life, women and literature. When the resulting book appeared in 1997 however, Benamou was turned upon by many of Mitterrand's family and associates- even Pierre Berg\u00e9, who financed the\" Globe\" magazine called it a work of\" absolute treachery\"- and they would not help with the film. It seems they were particularly outraged not by revelations about Mitterrand's private life,- Mitterrand had a secret second family including the daughter he kept hidden from the public- or anything to do with Vichy, but with a description of Mitterrand devouring a plateful of ortolans. The bird is a protected species and eating them forbidden under EU law. Certain other people at the dinner called Benamou a liar saying this incident never happened. Benamou denied this. In 2004 one of Mitterrand's closest associates, who had also been at the meal said Benamou was right but no ortolans appear in the film and Mitterrand eats a plate of oysters. Benamou, an Algerian born Sephardic Jew, asserted that he had not found Mitterrand anti-semitic either in his time in Vichy or afterwards,- something that Mitterrand, who sometimes spoke of' le lobby juif', his term for some French Jews' and their focus on his wartime record- had been accused of. Benamou defended Mitterrand in spite of his protection of collaborators like Ren\u00e9 Bousquet and Maurice Papon-\" Papon became a minister under Giscard d'Estaing; he was chief of police under de Gaulle. This is not a secret of Mitterrand[ but of] the French bourgeoisie and Mitterrand was an emblem of that.\" The film won a C\u00e9sar award for Michel Bouquet in his role as Mitterrand.\n\nQuestion: What is the cause of death of director of film The Street Of Illusion?": [

Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, \"Two for the Road\", was composed by Mancini, who wrote many notable theme songs for films, including \"Moon River\" for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". He considered \"Two for the Road\" his favourite of all the songs he wrote. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coup\u00e9, VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re-establish the time period after a jump. In one scene of this movie, Audrey Hepburn appears dressed in a shiny black PVC trouser suit designed by Paco Rabanne. The film was ranked #57 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years... 100 Passions\" list.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who is older, This Love Of Ours or The Red Siren?": [

He was a member of Adolf Hitler's entourage and brother-in-law to Eva Braun through his marriage to her sister Gretl. Fegelein joined a cavalry regiment of the Reichswehr in 1925 and transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933. He became a leader of an SS equestrian group, and was in charge of preparation for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. He tried out for the Olympic equestrian team himself but was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. In September 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, Fegelein commanded the SS \"Totenkopf Reiterstandarte\" (Death's-Head Horse Regiment). They were garrisoned in Warsaw until December. In May and June 1940, he participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (later renamed the \"Waffen-SS\"). For his service in these campaigns he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940. Units under his command on the Eastern Front in 1941 were responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 civilians during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation in the Byelorussian SSR. As commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" in 1943, he was involved in operations against partisans as well as defensive operations against the Red Army, for which he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze. After being seriously wounded in September 1943, Fegelein was reassigned by Heinrich Himmler to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS. Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life on 20 July 1944. He was on duty at Hitler's \"F\u00fchrerbunker\" in Berlin in the closing months of the war, and was shot for desertion on 28 April 1945, two days before Hitler's suicide. Fegelein was an opportunist who ingratiated himself with Himmler, who granted him the best assignments and rapid promotions. Historians William L. Shirer and Ian Kershaw characterise him as cynical and disreputable. Albert Speer called him \"one of the most disgusting people in Hitler's circle\".\n\nQuestion: Was Ralf Wohlleben or Ilya Tyapkin born first?": [

The story is about an alcoholic Broadway actress who tries to stay sober, while dealing with the problems of her teenaged daughter and her friends: an overly vain woman who fears the loss of her looks, and a gay actor relegated to small roles in third-rate shows. Simon changed the main character's name to Georgia Hines for the film adaptation; the character was named Evy Meara in the stage version. The main character went from being a cabaret singer to a Broadway stage actress. The film, written by Simon and directed by Glenn Jordan, stars Marsha Mason, Joan Hackett, James Coco, and Kristy McNichol. It also features two short scenes with then-unknowns Kevin Bacon and John Vargas. Simon's next release, \"I Ought to Be in Pictures\", was released just six months later, and its plot was similar. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Marsha Mason), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (James Coco), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Joan Hackett). \"Only When I Laugh\" proved to be very successful at the box office.

He first established himself as a movie star working with Frank Capra where he played idyllic and moral characters for \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938) and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), the latter of which earned him his first of five Academy Award nominations for Best Actor. The following year he won the Academy Award for his work in the screwball comedy \"The Philadelphia Story\", which also starred Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Stewart served during World War II and the Vietnam War as a pilot, rising to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Air Force Reserve. In 1985, Stewart was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. In 1946 Stewart starred as George Bailey in Capra's Christmas classic \"It's a Wonderful Life\". This role, which earned him another Oscar nomination, is his most recognized. He expanded his performances during his later career to include more flawed and disillusioned characters in films by Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann. Among his nine films with Mann are \"Winchester '73\" (1950) and \"The Naked Spur\" (1953), while amongst his four films with Hitchcock came \"Rope\" (1948), \"Rear Window\" (1954), \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956), and \"Vertigo\" (1958). \" Vertigo\" was ignored by critics at its time of release, but has since been reevaluated as an American cinematic masterpiece. Stewart's other later prominent films included the comedy-drama \"Harvey\" (1950) and the courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959), both of which landed him Academy Award nominations. Stewart also appeared in westerns such as \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962) and \"Cheyenne Autumn\" (1964), both directed by John Ford. In 1949 Stewart married former model Gloria Hatrick McLean, with whom he had twin daughters. He also adopted her two children from her previous marriage. Many of the films in which he starred have become enduring classics. Stewart received an Academy Honorary Award for his achievements in 1985 and in 1999 Stewart was named the third-greatest male screen legend of the Golden Age of Hollywood by the American Film Institute, behind Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the producer died earlier, The Criminal (1960 Film) or A Soldier'S Oath?": [

She was betrothed to Sigismund, Archduke of Austria. She was born in the city of Chinon in August 1428, as evidenced by an act of the Queen's Treasurer General dated August 29 of this year, referring to the \"gesine recently made in the city of Chinon, Madame Arragonde of France\" The young princess, the eldest daughter of the king, was baptized in honour of Saint Radegund, to whom her father devoted a particular cult. According to Christian de M\u00e9rindol, this choice was explained by reasons both political, historical and religious, in this particular context of reconquest of the kingdom of France on the English: \"The name of Radegonde had several meanings: symbol of the city of Poitiers, seat of the second Parliament, so place of resistance in Paris, in the hands of the English and Burgundians, symbol of legitimacy, because the saint was the wife of Clotaire, the son of Clovis, finally a saint who could only attract the graces of heaven, so necessary to the young king. \" She is the only princess of royal blood to have borne this name within the Capetian lineage. On April 22, 1430, his father promised her in marriage to Sigismund, born in 1427, son of the Archduke Frederick of Austria, Count of Tyrol. She became ill in Tours in 1445, perhaps suffering from pleurisy contracted after returning on foot from a pilgrimage to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de l'Epine. She died on March 19, at the age of 16 years. She is buried in the Saint-Gatien cathedral of Tours.

His military campaigns (1534\u201349) created the largest kingdom in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287. His administratively fragile kingdom proved to be the impetus for the eventual reunification of the entire country by his successor and brother-in-law Bayinnaung. Based out of their small landlocked principality in the Sittaung valley, Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung began their military campaigns in 1534 against the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and had conquered the wealthier but disunited kingdom by 1541. He then leveraged the coastal kingdom's wealth, manpower and access to Portuguese mercenaries and firearms, and extended his rule to the ancient capital of Pagan (Bagan) in 1544. However, his attempts to build an East-West empire fell short in Arakan (1545\u201347) and in Siam (1547\u201349). He actively courted the support of ethnic Mons of Lower Burma, many of whom were appointed to the highest positions in his government and armed forces. His chief queen and chief primate were Mons. He moved the capital to Pegu (Bago). The king was assassinated on his 34th birthday on the orders of Smim Sawhtut, one of his close advisers. The kingdom he had built up fell apart right after his death, which Bayinnaung had to restore in the next two years. His premature death has been called \"one of the great turning points of mainland [Southeast Asia's] history\". He is one of the most celebrated kings in Burmese history.

Tavares). Thus, the American company White Castle is generally credited with opening the second fast - food outlet in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast - food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram's and Walter Anderson's White Castle System created the first fast food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain's prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald's Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc's McDonald's outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.\n\nQuestion: When was the company that published The Rip Off Review Of Western Culture founded?": [

The lyrics come from a poem written in Arabic by the last Abencerrages king of Granada, Aben Humeya, in a translation by Niceto de Zamacois, which Sevilla found in a magazine used as packing material. The Spanish lyrics use the image of a migrating swallow to evoke sentiments of longing for the homeland. It became the signature song of the exiled Mexicans. The song was recorded in 1906 by Se\u00f1or Francisco. A guitar instrumental was recorded by Chet Atkins in 1955. The song has also been recorded by Caterina Valente (1959), Nat King Cole (1962), Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (1984), Flaco Jim\u00e9nez (1992, instrumental), and Caetano Veloso (1994). Felice & Boudleaux Bryant wrote lyrics in English, as \"She Wears My Ring\", which was first recorded by Jimmy Sweeney (also known as Jimmy Bell) in 1960 with notable cover versions by Roy Orbison (1962), Ray Price and Solomon King (both 1968), and Elvis Presley (1973). The song figures prominently in the 1969 film \"The Wild Bunch\", directed by Sam Peckinpah and scored by Jerry Fielding. The local people serenade the bandit protagonists with it as they leave Angel's Mexican village. The song, recorded by 13-year-old Heintje, became a German number-one hit in August 1968 (title: \" Du sollst nicht weinen,Thou shalt not cry\").

Although recognized first and foremost as a vocalist, bassist and songwriter, he also played double bass, harmonica, piano, cello and guitar.

After enjoying success with experimental productions in Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg, Martin went to Berlin, where he premiered Ernst Toller's anti-war drama, \"TransfigurationDie Wandlung\") on September 30, 1919. Performed in a hall seating fewer than 300 spectators, the production used the intimacy of the space to drive home the horrors of Toller's script. The sets were jagged flats placed against blackness, and lit with harsh white spotlights. Scenes ended in blackouts not, as was customary at the time, with the curtain falling. Fritz Kortner became famous for his intense portrayal of the young hero. Martin turned to film in 1920, when he directed a cinematic adaptation of one of the most celebrated expressionist dramas, Georg Kaiser's \"From Morn to MidnightVon morgens bis mitternachts\") with actor Ernst Deutsch as the Cashier who embezzles money from a bank and goes on a desperate search for meaning in his life in a nightmarish metropolis.\nAfter World War II, Martin revived Bertolt Brecht's \"The Threepenny Opera\" in Berlin, and\npremiered Georg Kaiser's pacifist drama, \"The Soldier TanakaDer Soldat Tanaka\").\n\nQuestion: Where did the director of film The Cloister Of Martins die?": [

The song charted at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and 34 on the US Mainstream rock charts The song starts with keyboardist Jon Lord's keyboards with emotional vocal delivery from singer David Coverdale. The song keeps a slow tempo until the guitars and drums kick in when the song tempo drastically changes and becomes a hard driving rock song. The slow tempo\" ballady\" section does n't emerge again until the very middle and very end of the song. According to the 25th Anniversary Edition booklet of\" Slide It In\", the keyboard intro was originally written for guitars, but was eventually switched to keyboards. Also, Coverdale told in the edition's booklet that drummer Cozy Powell once told the singer that\" Love Ai n't No Stranger\" was the best track he'd ever played drums on. The song was very well received and has been a Whitesnake live staple for many years. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic.com described the song as\" one of the decade's greatest power ballads, bar none.\" A music video was also made for the song, which depicts the band performing the song at a mock concert, with scenes of Coverdale running after an unknown woman. At the end of the video, Coverdale climbs on to a truck and hugs the woman, but as he turns around he sees that the woman has switched and that the woman he was after is standing on the ground. As the truck, along with Coverdale on it, starts to drive away Coverdale stares at the woman as she disappears into the mist.\n\nQuestion: Are both bands, The Renegades (Band) and Second Hand (Band), from the same country?": [

His performances in numerous films during the Classical Hollywood era made him an American cultural icon. In 1999, the American Film Institute selected him as the greatest male star of classic American cinema. Bogart began acting in Broadway shows and began his movie career in \"Up the River\" (1930). The film also starred Spencer Tracy. Bogart played the romantic role in a part as large as Tracy's, despite Bogart's much lower billing. Bogart appeared in various supporting parts for several years, sometimes portraying gangsters due to his resemblance to John Dillinger. He was highly praised for his work in \"The Petrified Forest\" (1936), which was his big break into the Warner Bros. gangster pantheon. Bogart's breakthrough from supporting roles to A-list stardom came with \"High Sierra\" (1941), his last role as a gangster, and \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), considered to be one of the first great film noirs. His private detectives Sam Spade in \"The Maltese Falcon\" and Phillip Marlowe in \"The Big Sleep\" (1946) became the model for detectives in other film noirs. His first true romantic lead role came when he appeared alongside Ingrid Bergman in \"Casablanca\" (1942), although filming the pair involved efforts to mask the fact Bergman was taller than the 5'8\" (1.73 m) Bogart. \" Casablanca\", a Best Picture Academy Award Winner, landed him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Bogart and 19-year-old Lauren Bacall fell in love when they filmed \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944) and soon after the main filming for \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), their second film together, concluded in early 1945, he filed for divorce from his third wife and married Bacall. After their marriage, she also played his love interest in \"Dark Passage\" (1947), and \"Key Largo\" (1948). Bogart's performances in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), as a paranoid gold prospector, and \"In a Lonely Place\" (1950), as a screenwriter suspected of murder, are today considered to be his best, although they were not as recognized at their time of release. The unsettled, sometimes terrifying character he portrayed in these roles is again illustrated in his World War II war boat commander in \"The Caine Mutiny\" (1954), which was a critical and commercial smash, and garnered him another Best Actor nomination. It was for his cantankerous transport boat pilot alongside Katharine Hepburn's missionary in the World War I adventure \"The African Queen\" (1951) that Bogart won the Academy Award for Best Actor. In his later years significant roles included competing with William Holden for Audrey Hepburn in \"Sabrina\" (1954) and \"The Barefoot Contessa\" with Ava Gardner. A heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart died from esophageal cancer in January 1957.\n\nQuestion: What is the date of birth of Teddy Hart's father?": [

In a failed attempt to recapture Kinmont Willie, Scrope \"burnt the towns of Annan and Dumfries to the ground, capturing two hundred prisoners whom he marched home 'naked, chained together on leashes'.

He was born in Macei\u00f3, Alagoas, and is best known as a member of the Cinema Novo movement. He is popularly known for his unconventional, yet intriguing film techniques among other film producers of the Cinema Novo movement. Diegues is also widely known for his dynamic use visuals, ideas, plots, themes, and other cinematic techniques. He incorporated many musical acts in his film as he favored musical pieces to be complementary of his ideas. Diegues remains very popular and is regarded one the most cinematic producers of his generation. Of the Cinema Novo directors, he would go on to produce films, plays, musicals and other forms of entertainment in Brazil. Diegues' contributions to Brazilian cinema developed the film industry. He would pioneer expensive film projects that domestic filmmakers had ever seen. Films such as \"Bye Bye Brazil\" were two million dollar projects and later on films such as \"God is Brazilian\" would be over 10 million dollars. This was a new era in Brazil as domestic directors had yet to produce any films with that kind of financial support. He admits to using Brazilians in his films as much as he can. Diegues would use extras, film technicians, painters, sculptors and other essential personnel of Brazilian backgrounds even if they were inexperienced. Diegues attempted to consistently represent the underrepresented people of Brazil in his films. He suggests that history is written by the winners and the afro-Brazilian communities were not among those who were given a chance to write their own history. He also proposed the idea that up until this movement, cinema in Brazil only provided the white Brazilian experience despite the growing masses of black Brazilians all over the country. He is known for distinguished publications that uplift the Afro-Brazilian spirit and bodies. In 2018, Diegues was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born first, La M\u00f4me Vert-De-Gris or The Pod People?": [

Johnson, Arthur Vaughan Johnson left college at 19 to join a traveling Shakespearean troupe. He later appeared on stage with Sol Smith Russell, Robert B. Mantell and Marie Wainwright. Johnson began as a film actor in 1905 with the Edison Studios in The Bronx, New York, appearing in the one- reel drama\" The White Caps\" directed by Wallace McCutcheon, Sr., and Edwin S. Porter. In 1908, he went to work for Biograph Studios, where he acted in films directed by D.W. Griffith including\" Resurrection\"( 1909) and\" In Old California\"( 1910), the first movie Griffith ever shot in Hollywood. At Biograph, Arthur Johnson performed with stars such as Mary Pickford and Florence Lawrence. Johnson was reputed to be Griffith's favorite actor. In 1911 he accepted an offer from Lubin Studios in Philadelphia that allowed him to direct as well as act. With Lottie Briscoe, his frequent co-star at Lubin, Johnson directed and starred in\" The Belov\u00e9d Adventurer\"( 1914), a 15 episode serial by Emmett Campbell Hall. After performing in more than three hundred silent film shorts and directing twenty- six, health problems ended his career in 1915. According to an interview published nine months before his death, Arthur V. Johnson married actress Maude Webb when he was 20 years old; the couple had a daughter who lived with Johnson's parents. Other sources indicate that around 1910 he married Florence Hackett, with whom he appeared in the 1913 film\" Power of the Cross\". He died of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1916, a few weeks short of his fortieth birthday.

R. Subba Rao's three novels \"NagarahavuOndu Gandu Eradu Hennu\" and \"Sarpa Mathsara\", and starring Vishnuvardhan, Aarathi , K. S. Ashwath and Shubha in lead roles. The supporting cast features Leelavathi, Ambareesh, Shivaram, Dheerendra Gopal, Lokanath and Vajramuni. This is the first Kannada movie to complete 100 days in three centres. This film was remade in Hindi as \"Zehreela Insaan\", directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself and in Tamil as \"Raja Nagam\" and \"Kode Nagu\" in Telugu. The film was a huge success and paved way for the stardom of Vishnuvardhan and Ambarish who eventually morphed as leading actors in Kannada cinema. This was Vishnuvardhan's first movie as the lead. Over a period of time, the character roles of Leelavathi, Dheerendra Gopal, Loknath, M. N. Lakshmi Devi have come in for their share of applause. The film primarily revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his teacher, Chamayya (K. S. Ashwath). Chamayya, who is childless treats Ramachari (Vishnuvardhan) as his son. He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger. He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour. Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness. He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride. Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything. His love interests are Alamelu (Aarathi) and Margaret (Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life. The conversations between the Guru (Chamayya) and Shishya (Ramachari) is the highlight of movie all through. Chamayya and Ramachari have differences of opinion over what is right and wrong. Chamayya is more willing to blend in with the society than Ramachari and this usually ends in an argument between the two. It is possible that the society is the silent rhetoric for the title of the movie which spreads venom \u2014 a cobra. The movie was remade in Hindi as \"Zehreela Insaan\" , in Tamil as \"Raja Nagam\" and in Telugu as \"Kode Nagu \". The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018. This movie was digitalized by Balaji who is the brother of V.Ravichandran and son of Veeraswammy who was the producer. Re-release was also a big hit and broke so-many records.

The screenplay was by Paul Schrader, from a story by De Palma and Schrader. Bernard Herrmann provided the film's soundtrack prior to his death in 1975. The story is about a New Orleans businessman who is haunted by guilt following the death of his wife and daughter during a kidnapping- rescue attempt gone wrong. Years after the tragedy, he meets and falls in love with a young woman who is the exact look- alike of his long dead wife. Both De Palma and Schrader have pointed to Alfred Hitchcock's\" Vertigo\"( 1958) as the major inspiration for\" Obsession\"'s narrative and thematic concerns. Schrader's script was extensively rewritten and pared down by De Palma prior to shooting, causing the screenwriter to proclaim a complete lack of interest in the film's subsequent production and release. Completed in 1975, Columbia Pictures picked up the distribution rights but demanded that minor changes be made to reduce potentially controversial aspects of the plot. When finally released in the late summer of 1976, it became De Palma's first substantial box office success and received a mixed response from critics.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died later, Rhythm In The Clouds or September Affair?": [

In September 2009, the Swedish parliament members Mats Johansson (M) and Luciano Astudillo (S) took the initiative of displaying the movie in the Parliament of Sweden, this being its premiere in Sweden. In late 2010 a court in Los Angeles decided in favor of the movie crew, making it possible to release the film in the US. A judge awarded the filmmakers nearly $200,000 in fees and costs.

The film is a hybrid documentary and fictional narrative. Documentary segments include traditional talking-head clips from musicians, writers, and social critics, as well as archival video footage and photographs. Described as \"A truly masterful film essay about Black aesthetics that traces the deployments of science fiction within pan-African culture\", it has also been called \"one of the most influential video-essays of the 1990s, influencing filmmakers and inspiring conferences, novels and exhibitions\". The fictional story follows the journey of the \"data thief\" who must travel across time and space in search of a crossroads where he makes archaeological digs for fragments of history and technology in search of the code that holds the key to his future. The structure of the film makes it a meta-narrative commenting on while also becoming part of the genre of Afrofuturism. The film uses concepts based on George Clinton's Mothership Connection and features interviews with Clinton, Derrick May, Samuel R. Delany, Nichelle Nichols, Juan Atkins, DJ Spooky, Goldie, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Kodwo Eshun and others to explore the link between black music as a way of exploring the future. The film makes mention of Sun Ra, whose work centres on the return of blacks to outer space in his own Mothership. \"The Last Angel of History\" emphasizes black musical traditions. The film argues that the drum, which could \"communicate both across the African diaspora and across time,\" was the \"first Afrofuturistic technology. \" In \"Further Considerations on Afrofuturism,\" Eshun says of the film: The Last Angel of History\" remains the most elaborate exposition on the convergence of ideas that is Afrofuturism. Through the persona of a time-traveling nomadic figure known as the Data Thief, \"The Last Angel of History\" created a network of links between music, space, futurology, and diaspora. \" The film forges links between, for example, spirituals, P-Funk, and techno.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, Lamine Fomba or Michael Hagan?": [

He was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including \"City for Conquest\" (1940). Noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), and \"East of Eden\" (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar. His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\", one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. \" A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", which introduced James Dean to movie audiences. A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong. \" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event. Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses. \" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous. \" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film \"A Letter to Elia\" as a personal tribute to Kazan.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Meet Me On Broadway born?": [

He was born in Vordingborg, Denmark. The Heiberg ancestry can be traced back to Norway, and has produced a long line of priests, headmasters and other learned men. Peter Andreas Heibergs father was the Norwegian-born headmaster of the grammar school in Vordingborg, Ludvig Heiberg, while his mother was Inger Margrethe, daughter of the vicar at the manor of Vemmetofte Peder Heiberg, a relative of Ludvig Heiberg, and Inger H\u00f8rning, who came from a family of wealthy Danish merchants. His father died when Heiberg was just two years old, and his mother moved with the children to live with her father at Vemmetofte near the town of Faxe in Zealand. This was to be Heiberg's home until he went to grammar school, from which he graduated in 1774. In 1777 he took the greater philological exam, and in 1779 he left Copenhagen, presumably due to gambling debts. He then went to Sweden to join the Swedish military forces. One and a half years later, his family bought him out of his military service, and after a short stay in Uppsala, he went to Bergen, where he stayed with his uncle for three years. In Bergen Heiberg met several writers who inspired him to start writing himself. After his return to Copenhagen, he used his linguistic skills to get a job as an interpreter. Heiberg also translated a publication by the French writer Jean-Charles Laveaux, which was highly critical towards the upper class, this was likely the reason why Heiberg chose to publish the translated version anonymously. In 1790, Heiberg married the 16-year-old Thomasine Buntzen with whom he has the son Johan Ludvig. Many of Heiberg's role models were French and usually marked by the ideals of the Enlightenment. His d\u00e9but novel \"Rigsdalersedlens H\u00e6ndelser\" (1789) critically describes merchants, the nobility and the German influence on Denmark. This novel highly angered the Danish upper class, but Heiberg kept writing similarly critical songs, articles, essays and plays (one play, \"Heckingborn\", being translated into English in 1799 with the title \"Poverty and Wealth\"). This political criticism led to Heiberg being banished on Christmas Eve, 1799. He had previously been given many warnings and fines for his works full of criticism of the government, but after new, harsher censorship laws were introduced by the crown prince Frederick in September 1799 he was accused and sentenced retroactively to banishment. Thereafter, Heiberg settled in Paris where he lived until his death in 1841. About his life in Paris, see \"Encyclop\u00e9die des gens du monde\", vol. 13, p. 594.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Richard Longstreth or Jenny Algelid-Bengtsson?": [

The film, set during the Second Boer War in 1901, is a period drama that follows Willem Morkel, a Cape Rebel Boer/ Afrikaans farmer who was captured and sent to a British prisoner of war camp on St. Helena Island in the Atlantic Ocean. Placed under terrible oppression and hardship, Morkel and his comrades slowly come together to assert their defiance, humanity and human spirit and, more specifically, through the game of rugby. \" Blood and Glory\" is a fictional account, using the backdrop of the Anglo- Boer War with some of the places in the plot resembling historical locations from the war. The film's protagonist, Willem Morkel, is loosely based on Sommie Morkel, who went on to play for the South Africa national rugby union team. The historical authenticity of backdrop events, conditions and attitudes in the plot of the film can be debated, as its depiction of the Boers and the British relies heavily on glorification of the former and vilification of the latter. However, the film's main villain( Australian Colonel Swanell) owes something to the real life Breaker Morant( convicted for murder and as a war criminal by the British during the Boer War and executed). It is documented that 28 000 Boer women and children, as well as 20 000 black people, died in British concentration camps( Professor Fransjohan, 2011 writing for BBC). The film also makes mention of the scorched earth policy implemented by Kitchener during the Boer War.\" Blood and Glory\" is a co-production by Dark Matter Studios and Collective Dream Films. The film is written and directed by Sean Else( Spud 2, Platteland,'n Man soos My Pa), and produced by Llewelynn Greeff( Leading Lady) and Henk Pretorius( Leading Lady, Fanie Fourie's Lobola, Wolwedans in die Skemer, Hoofmeisie and the Bakgat Trilogy)\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, The Pride And The Passion or Lamhe?": [

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent film era. At the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\". Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, \"National Velvet\" and \"The Human Comedy\", said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\". Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played Puck in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in \"Boys Town\". At 19, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in \"Babes in Arms\", and he was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award in 1939. At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer. Rooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941 and one of the best-paid actors of that era, but his career would never again rise to such heights. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961), \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" (1962), \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), and \"The Black Stallion\" (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in \"Sugar Babies\" and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an Emmy in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in \"Bill\" (1981).\n\nQuestion: Which award the performer of song In 20-0-3 earned?": [

The parents of Hipparchus were paternal second cousins. The paternal grandfather of Hipparchus was Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus who served as an Archon of Athens in 143- 144 AD, while his maternal grandparents were Roman Senator, Sophist Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes or Herodes Atticus and the Roman aristocratic noblewoman Aspasia Annia Regilla.

While here he was able to win over the Government of Baden for the Prussian policy, and, as Bismarck testified, \"by cautious and tactful bearing to win a commanding position at Karlsruhe for the Prussian government.\" From 1859 Karl Friedrich was Prussian ambassador at Dresden, from 1862 at Brussels, and from 1864 he was minister with full powers at the Diet of the German Confederation at Frankfort. In 1866 he offered at the Diet the Prussian motion for the reform of the German Confederation, and when it was rejected on 14 June, 1866, he declared the withdrawal of Prussia, upon which the Austro-Prussian war began. Later in connection with Bismarck he was plenipotentiary in making a treaty of peace with the states of southern Germany and Saxony. He was the presiding officer of the government conferences for the drafting of a constitution for the North German Confederation, and was a plenipotentiary at the Reichstag which decided the constitution. Thus he performed important services in national affairs. In 1868 he retired partially, and in 1871 entirely, from government positions in order to become one of the parliamentary leaders of the Catholics. From 1867 he was a member of the Lower House of the Prussian Diet, from 1868 a member of the Lower House of the Diet of the North German Confederation, and later of the German Reichstag, or Parliament of the German Empire. In 1871 he took part in the founding of the Centre Party. He was not particularly distinguished as a speaker, but his knowledge, distinguished personality, and connections were of much benefit to the Catholic cause. He believed that \"laws are not made but found\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Nancy Kassebaum's father?": [

The son of the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George by his first wife, Margaret Owen, Lloyd George was educated at Portmadoc School and Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1910. During the First World War he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers and rose to the rank of Major. He became an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and served in the British Army again during the Second World War. On 7 April 1917 Lloyd George married Roberta McAlpine (1898\u20131966), a daughter of Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet. They had two children, Valerie Davidia (1918\u20132000) and Owen (1924\u20132010), before being divorced in 1933. In 1935 Lloyd George married secondly Winifred Emily Peedle, a daughter of Thomas W. Peedle. Valerie became the wife of the academic and broadcasting executive, Sir Goronwy Daniel. On 1 January 1945 his father was created Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, and he gained the courtesy title of Viscount Gwynedd. Less than three months later, on 26 March 1945, his father died of cancer and he inherited his peerage, unusually becoming the first member of the family to sit in the House of Lords, as David Lloyd George had been too ill to do so. He wrote a biography of his mother, \"Dame Margaret\", and of his father, \"Lloyd George\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of David Ogilvy, 12Th Earl Of Airlie born?": [

His father, Stephen the Posthumous, was the posthumous son of Andrew II of Hungary although Stephen's brothers considered him a bastard. Andrew grew up in Venice, and first arrived in Hungary upon the invitation of a rebellious baron, Ivan K\u0151szegi, in 1278. K\u0151szegi tried to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary, but the conspiracy collapsed and Andrew returned to Venice. Being the last male member of the House of \u00c1rp\u00e1d, Andrew was elected king after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a coronation diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders\u2014Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer\u2014challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule. Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew's reign. The K\u0151szegis, the Cs\u00e1ks, and other powerful families autonomously governed their domains, rising up nearly every year in open rebellion against Andrew. With Andrew's death, the House of \u00c1rp\u00e1d became extinct. A civil war ensued which lasted for more than two decades and ended with the victory of Mary of Hungary's grandson, Charles Robert.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Clodia Pulchra (Wife Of Octavian)'s mother?": [

He is best known for his silent films, in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic, deadpan expression that earned him the nickname \"The Great Stone Face\". Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929\" when he \"worked without interruption\" on a series of films that make him \"the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies\". His career declined afterward with a loss of artistic independence when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, his wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He recovered in the 1940s, remarried, and revived his career as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life, earning an Honorary Academy Award in 1959. Many of Keaton's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded, such as \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924), \"The General\" (1926), and \"The Cameraman\" (1928), with \"The General\" widely viewed as his masterpiece. Among its strongest admirers was Orson Welles, who stated that \"The General\" was cinema's highest achievement in comedy, and perhaps the greatest film ever made. Keaton in 1996 was recognized as the seventh-greatest film director by \"Entertainment Weekly\", and the American Film Institute ranked him in 1999 as the 21st greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, The Rise And Rise Of Michael Rimmer or Bar 51?": [

Born in Sedan, Ardennes, he was the son of Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, Prince of Sedan, and Elisabeth of Orange-Nassau. His brother was the renowned Turenne, Marshal of France. Raised as a Protestant, he received a military education in Holland under his uncles, Maurice of Nassau-Orange, and Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. He became Duke of Bouillon, and Prince of Sedan, Jametz, and Raucourt (now in Ardennes, France) at the death of his father in 1623. He was appointed governor of Maastricht in the United Provinces in 1629. In 1634 he married Countess Eleonora van Berg's-Heerenberg, under whose influence he converted to Catholicism. In 1635 the Duke of Bouillon came into the service of King Louis XIII of France, and was appointed \"mar\u00e9chal de camp\" (brigadier general). He was deprived of his offices in the United Provinces after engaging in negotiations with Spain (the arch-enemy of the United Provinces) in 1637. Along with the Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons, he conspired against Cardinal Richelieu, and with the support of Spanish troops he and the comte de Soissons defeated the French royal troops sent after them at the Battle of La Marf\u00e9e, outside of Sedan, in 1641. Later he submitted to King Louis XIII and Richelieu, and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in command of the French army of Italy (1642). Having again conspired against Richelieu with Cinq-Mars, he was arrested in Casale Italy, and was released only when his wife threatened to open Sedan to the Spaniards (1642). During this misfortune, he promised to cede the strategic border principalities of Sedan and Raucourt to France. In 1650 he joined the Fronde, and was one of its leaders with his brother Turenne. Cardinal Mazarin won him over (1650) by promising him high office and compensations for the cessions of Sedan and Raucourt, exchanged in 1651 for the duchies of Albret and Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, the counties of Auvergne and \u00c9vreux, and several other lands. He died at Pontoise, near Paris, in 1652 and was buried in \u00c9vreux.\n\nQuestion: When is Luke Dillon, 4Th Baron Clonbrock's father's birthday?": [

For a time he was considered his father's heir, but that changed after his mother's downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius' knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina's son, Lucius Domitius, whose name became Nero as a result. His step- brother would later be married to his sister Octavia, and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' heir. Following his father's death in October 54, Nero became emperor. The sudden death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth birthday is reported by all extant sources as a poisoning on Nero's orders\u2014as Claudius' natural son, he represented a threat to Nero's claim to the throne.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of Daughter Of Julius Constantius?": [

Upon the death of her brother, Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross, she became the heir- presumptive of her niece Euphemia II, Countess of Ross although her husband Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles pressed Mariota's superior claim to the earldom. Domhnall attempted to gain control of the earldom, and sometime after 1405 but before 1411, Domhnall gained control of Dingwall Castle. In the year after the death of the nominal king Robert III of Scotland( 1406), in August 1407, Domhnall sent emissaries to England to the heir of the throne, the captive James Stewart. King Henry IV of England sent his own emissaries the following year to negotiate an alliance against Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, the Guardian of Scotland who was controlling Euphemia and the earldom. With control over the principal seat of the earldom of Ross and support of the exiled heir to the Scottish throne, in 1411 Domhnall felt strong enough to march against Albany's main northern ally, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. At the Battle of Harlaw Domhnall failed to inflict a decisive victory, and withdrew back to the western highlands. In the aftermath, Albany was able to retake Dingwall and seize control of Easter Ross. In 1415, Euphemia was persuaded by Albany to resign the earldom to his own second son, John Stewart, Earl of Buchan. This action was challenged by Domhnall of Islay, who continued to claim the earldom on behalf of Mariota. After the return of King James the latter destroyed the power of the Albany Stewarts, executing the Albany's son and successor Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany. Domhnall had died in 1423, but Mariota continued to enjoy the support of his successor and her own son, Alexander. Alexander took over her claims, and in 1437 her son was recognized as earl by the king. She died in 1440. She had two known children, Alexander and Mariota.\n\nQuestion: Who is Bertrand, Count Of Toulouse's child-in-law?": [

He studied film arts at the University of Washington and transferred to the Beijing Film Academy, where he finished his undergraduate studies in directing. In 2001, he wrote and directed \"Bus 44\"  starring Chinese film star Gong Beibi. The film premiered and won awards at the 2001 Venice Film Festival and 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and was invited to 2002 Cannes Film Festival \" Directors' Fortnight\" - becoming the first Chinese short film to be invited in all three festivals' history. The film was covered extensively in the Chinese media and was critically acclaimed in both China and Europe and gained TV and theatrical distribution in territories worldwide. In 2005, Eng wrote and directed a Chinese independent feature film \"Waiting Alone\" , starring an ensemble cast of Chinese stars including Xia Yu, Gong Beibi, Li Bingbing, and featuring cameos from some of Asia's most well-known actors including Chow Yun-fat. The film has been called one of 2005 \"best films\" by over 50 media. \" Waiting Alone \" became a hit after its September 2005 domestic China wide-release, and went on to receive 3 nominations (including Best Picture) at the Chinese Academy Awards (Golden Rooster Awards) -- the first ever in the history of the awards by a foreign director. The film remains the highest-rated romantic comedy in China on Douban and other review sites. Eng was invited, in 2007, to direct the first-ever opening short for the Chinese academy awards. He got some of Asia\u2019s biggest stars, Ziyi Zhang, Liu Ye and Ge You, to spoof the action-movie genre in a humorous send-up on national TV in China. In 2011, Eng wrote, directed, and produced \"Inseparable\" starring Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, Daniel Wu, Gong Beibi, Yan Ni, and Peter Stormare. The quirky psychological suspense/dramedy debuted at the Busan International Film Festival in 2011 to positive reviews and was released in China in May 2012. Inseparable was named as one of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Top 10 Most Notable Asian Films of the Year.

It went on to beat market expectations and gross an estimated RMB$70 million. The fantasy-comedy had the highest audience scores (averaging 8.0/10) for live-action comedies released that summer, and gained a total of 100,000,000 paid views across the top three online movie platforms in just over two weeks in China. Wished stars Xia Yu, Yan Ni, K-pop star Victoria Song along with cameos from China\u2019s biggest names including Daniel Wu, Wang Baoqiang, Bao Bei'er et al.

Its plot follows a sullen, overweight nurse who is seduced by a con man, with whom she embarks on a murder spree of elderly women. The film was inspired by the true story of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, the notorious \"lonely hearts killers\" of the 1940s.

However, after Scorsese was fired early into the shoot, Kastle, who had helped develop the film, took over directing. The film's score comprises the first movement of the 6th Symphony and a section of the 5th Symphony of Gustav Mahler. Released in early 1970, the film was met with critical praise for its performances, as well as remark of its realism. \"The Honeymoon Killers\" went on to achieve cult status as well as critical recognition, and was named by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as his \"favorite American film.\" A digital restoration of the film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in 2003, and again in 2015 with a new digital transfer.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of the director of film Fear And Trembling (Film)?": [

Her most significant role in the main plot of an episode came in ``Chuck Versus the Truth, ''in which Ellie attempted to treat nuclear expert Mason Whitney when he was poisoned by Reardon Payne. When Whitney later died, Payne, disguised as a police officer taking a statement, exposed Ellie to the same toxic truth serum he used on Whitney to find where he hid his nuclear codes. Ellie nearly died as a result of the poisoning until Chuck administered the antidote. Although she was in a coma during this time, Ellie became the first person Chuck told about his secret life. She was also among the hostages in the Buy More when Ned Rhyerson crashed his car into the store while evading the police. For her sake, Chuck convinced Devon not to go through with a plan to overwhelm Ned, and later identified himself as the Intersect to Mauser to prevent him from killing her. The bracelet Chuck gave to Sarah in the same episode was a charm bracelet Chuck and Ellie's father gave to their mother when Ellie was born.\n\nQuestion: Who is Eva Chamberlain's maternal grandmother?": [

It was so named by the Mouzon mission in 1952 after a Breton noun which means\" the land close to the sea\". It extends in a northwesterly south- easterly direction at an altitude of about 1 m, over a length of about 3.7 km and a maximum width of 700 m, covering around 200 ha. From the south, a stream passing down the Volcan du Diable feeds the lake, having collected the waters coming from the slopes of the volcano as well as those of the Val d'Enfer and the Val des Trolls, and thus their lakes. Another stream feeds the lake from the north. Lake Armor flows into the marine waters of the Gulf of Morbihan in the Hurley Bay. Near the lake is the only known spot in Kerguelen of\" Elaphoglossum randii\", a small fern endemic to the sub-Antarctic islands of the Indian Ocean, which occurs elsewhere only in the Marion and Prince Edward Islands. The southern beaches of Lake Armor are also known for their curious little pebbles, rolled by the waves and nicknamed\" Armor dicks\" because of their evocative shape. An introduction of salmonids has been achieved between 1977 and 1992 in the Lake Armor and its tributaries. The first release of fry occurred in 1977 with Atlantic salmon( Salmo salar) from Scotland. Such a release was reared in 1978 and 1980. Furthermore, an experiment of salmon farming started in 1984, but this time with Pacific species: mainly Coho salmon( Oncorhynchus kisutch) and also Chinook salmon( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). After being raised in floating cages in the freshwater of the lake, the smolts were freed expecting they would come back as adults to their nursery place. In order to monitor this experiment a technical base had been built near the outflow of the lake. The experiment stopped in 1991 and the station was then abandoned. In 1991 and 1992, last releases were done with some young fish of other species: Brown trout( Salmo trutta), Brook trout( Salvelinus fontinalis) from local acclimated populations and Arctic char( Salvelinus alpinus) native to Haute- Savoie. Sedimentological surveys were carried out from 2007 in the northern part of Lake Armor to collect information on the climate changings for 1200 years.\n\nQuestion: Are both Lac \u00c0 La Catin and Batiscan Lake (Quebec) located in the same country?": [

The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden during the first decade of the twentieth century. Following the death of the eponymous children's father( Allan Edwall), their mother( Ewa Fr\u00f6ling) remarries a prominent bishop( Jan Malmsj\u00f6) who becomes abusive towards Alexander for his vivid imagination. Bergman intended\" Fanny and Alexander\" to be his final picture before retiring, and his script is semi-autobiographical. The characters Alexander, Fanny and stepfather Edvard are based on himself, his sister Margareta and father Erik Bergman, respectively. Many of the scenes were filmed on location in Uppsala. The documentary film\" The Making of Fanny and Alexander\" was made simultaneously with the feature and chronicles its production. The production was originally conceived as a television miniseries and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188- minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The television version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312- minute cut is one of the longest cinematic films in history. The theatrical version was released to positive reviews. It won four Academy Awards, including for Best Foreign Language Film; three Guldbagge Awards, including Best Film; and other honours. \" Fanny and Alexander\" was followed by stage adaptations and further semi-autobiographical screenplays by Bergman, released as films in 1992:\" The Best Intentions\", directed by Bille August, and\" Sunday's Children\", directed by Daniel Bergman.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born later, Ada Apa Dengan Cinta? or Adam & Paul?": [

Like her older sister Grand Duchess Olga, she nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital from 1914 to 1917, until the family was arrested following the first Russian Revolution. Her murder by communist revolutionaries on 17 July 1918 resulted in her being named as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. Tatiana and all of her siblings were falsely rumored to have survived the assassination and dozens of impostors claimed to be surviving Romanovs. Author Michael Occleshaw speculated that a woman named Larissa Tudor might have been Tatiana; however, all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were killed by the Bolsheviks.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Yakov Dzhugashvili's mother?": [

He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Dur\u00e1n). Dur\u00e1n also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Neil Lloyd Macky or Domenico Cosselli?": [

The plot revolves around a series of Village People- themed murders in a small town, and the police who investigate the crimes. The title is a satirical reference to the 1980 film\" Ca n't Stop the Music\", in which the Village People star. Eck and Saleh play two police constables in a rural village,' Gary' and' Akmal' who lead fairly unremarkable lives. Gary's main aim is to be crowned line dancing champion of the village, having always been the runner- up. However, a series of horrific murders, involving the mutilation of bodies, rock the town, and' Tony'( Mir), a detective from the city, is called in reluctantly to investigate. Whilst the young Akmal is in awe of the dashing detective, Tony's aggressive methods clash with the uptight Gary, and' Chief Carter'( Richard Carter), the officer in charge of the station. Tony is eventually sent back to the city, after shooting a French male stripper. Gary and Akmal soon discover that the murders have a Village People theme, with those murdered having been in one of the occupations of a Village Person, or resembling one. They fearfully deduce that either a policeman or a dentist( Akmal is uncertain, as he does n't clearly remember the Village People, although Gary quickly deduces that it is, in fact, a policeman) will be next to die, as does Tony, who rushes back from the city. The film stars a number of Australian stand- up comedians including Jimeoin, Bob Franklin, The Umbilical Brothers, Kitty Flanagan, Garry Who, Haskel Daniel, Richard Carter, The Dickster, Rash Ryder, Kenny Graham and Sandman.\n\nQuestion: Are both Don Sasa and Boyd R.

It is a tender but unflinching study of his mother, Barbara Holper (c. 1451\u20131514), completed while she was gravely ill, two months before she died. D\u00fcrer was close to his mother and after her death wrote that she had \"died hard\" and that \"I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it\". In its bleakness of mood, the drawing has been compared to his two great 1514 engravings, \"Melencolia I\" and \"Madonna by the Wall\". This work is her second portrait; the c. 1490 oil on oak panel painting now in Nuremberg is today generally accepted to be either an original or a copy of a lost original. It was bought in c. 1877 by the Kupferstichkabinett from the Firmin-Didot auction house in Paris during a period of acquisition of over 35 D\u00fcrer drawings by the gallery.\n\nQuestion: Where does B.

His most notable portrayal was as the barber in the Academy Award- winning film( 1927). Born in Rochester, New York, Sipperly had a career in the Broadway theatre before breaking into silent films. His earliest known appearance was in a performance of\" A Prince There Was\"( 1918), followed by\" The Meanest Man in the World\"( 1920),\" Six Cylinder Love\"( 1921),\" The Deep Tangled Wild- Wood\"( 1923) and other( mostly) comedies. His first known film part was in the movie version of\" Six Cylinder Love\"( 1923) in which he played the same character he had on- stage. During one theatrical performance of\" Six- Cylinder Love\" in New York in 1921, Sipperly, who played a high- powered car salesman, accidentally drove an actual automobile off the stage and into the first row of seats. No one was injured, though screams erupted in the sold- out hall, and one woman\" became hysterical\" as people scrambled out of the way. The incident made\" The New York Times\" the following day, but apparently had no effect on Sipperly's career. Another\" New York Times\" article of 1925 reported that Sipperly,\" saxophonist de luxe of\" The Fall Guy\" has selected the design for the monument that is to mark the site of his Rochester birthplace. It is to consist of two baseball bats crossed above a dumbbell. It seems that baseball has been the dominant fact in this actor's life.\" Sipperly died in Bangor, Maine, and is buried in that city's Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nQuestion: Did Dwight Harwood and Velvet (Singer) have the same nationality?": [

After this discussion, Booth attempted to convince Brennan to give a relationship a try. However, she declined, telling him that she, unlike him, is not a gambler, and is n't able to take that kind of a chance. They have subsequently attempted to date other people, although the fact that Booth once comments that he regards Brennan as his ``standard ''for other women suggests that he, at least, has not completely moved on. Brennan does admit to her best friend Angela Montenegro that as time has gone on, she is unsure if she wants to keep doing consulting work for the FBI, citing that she is tired of murderers and victims, and is constantly worried that something will happen to Booth and she will be unable to save him. In the climax of Season Five, Brennan and Booth part ways for a year -- he goes to Afghanistan while she leaves for the Maluku Islands in Indonesia -- but they promise to meet, one year from that day, at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nQuestion: Who is older, Kevin Hennessy or Emilia Bayer?": [

Though nearly all of the Ramones' songs were credited equally to all the band members, Dee Dee was the band's most prolific lyricist and composer, writing many of their best- known songs, such as\" 53 rd& 3 rd Commando Wart HogRockaway BeachPoison Heart\" and\" Bonzo Goes To Bitburg\", retitled\" My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down\". The song\" Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\" won the New York Music Award for best independent single of the year in 1986 and\" Animal Boy\" won for best album. Beauvoir and Dee Dee later co-wrote the song\" Cut Me To Pieces\", which was featured in the film\" Rock and Roll High School Forever\". Dee Dee was initially the band's lead vocalist, though his( then) inability to sing and play bass at the same time resulted in original drummer Joey Ramone taking over the lead vocalist duties( however, he still sang lead vocals in the band on occasion). Dee Dee was the band's bassist and songwriter from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short- lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand- new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band retired. Dee Dee was addicted to drugs for much of his life, particularly heroin. He began using drugs as a teenager and continued to use for the majority of his adult life. He appeared clean in the early 1990s but began using heroin again sometime later. He died from a heroin overdose on June 5, 2002.\n\nQuestion: Where did the composer of song The Shepherd On The Rock die?": [

He played string bass and rhythm guitar for a western band, The Valley Ranch Boys. Two years later he formed a staff band for Pittsburgh radio station KDKA that he named Riders of the Purple Sage after the title of the Zane Grey novel. Riders of the Purple Sage performed five hour-long shows a week on KDKA from 1936\u20131938. The band later moved to New York City and performed on radio station WOR and at a nightclub, Village Barn. Page served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. During the war another western band using the name Riders of the Purple Sage was organized in California by singer Foy Willing. Page moved to the West Coast in the 1950s. He and Willing eventually met and the two men formed a lifelong friendship. Page, who could play 21 instruments, worked as a studio musician in California. He played guitar on the original recording of the theme song for the NBC western series \"Bonanza\" and also served as background musician for the TV shows \"Wagon Train\" and \"Laramie\". According to Bob Bain, however, the only one of the four guitarists on the \"Bonanza\" theme recording still living, Page was not one of the guitarists on that session. In the late 1950s, Page lived in Hesperia, California where he owned and ran a restaurant. He also rodeoed in the summer circuit, traveling with rodeo champion Eddy Akridge. In the 1960s Page worked for the Baldwin Piano Company and helped engineers develop the Supersound amplifier. Page received the Country/Western Living Legend Award from the North American Country Music Associations International in 2001. His first solo recording, \"Right Place to Start\", was released on CD in December 2005. Page's last public concert was in July 2006 in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he performed before a crowd of several thousand people during a National Day of the Cowboy celebration.

As a child he was known as the prince of Genevois. He was the Duke of Nemours from 1585 to his death in 1595, during the French Wars of Religion. Charles Emmanuel was duke at a volatile time, and subsequently was involved in many political intrigues, mostly by his relationship on his mother's side with the House of Guise. The Duke of Guise was one of the leaders of the Catholic League opposing the Huguenots, and Charles Emmanuel sympathised with their cause. However, after the assassination of Henry I, Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Guise, Charles Emmanuel was imprisoned by the Huguenots in 1588, but was able to escape. He was to fight the Huguenot forces for some years; he fought at the Battle of Arques in 1589. That same year, Charles Emmanuel was the governor of Paris, as the Huguenot forces, led by Henry of Navarre besieged Paris. During the siege, King Henry III of France perished, and Henry of Navarre soon declared himself King Henry IV of France. Charles Emmanuel escaped, and fought the newly proclaimed King at the Ivry in 1590, which was a decisive loss for the Catholic League. The same year he commanded Catholic forces during the Siege of Paris, successfully defending the city. After the defeat, Charles Emmanuel strongly disagreed with his half-brother and long-time ally Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne (also of the House of Guise), who advocated conciliation with Henry IV. Charles Emmanuel withdrew to his government in Lyonnais, where he endeavoured to make himself independent from the French crown. He was imprisoned, however, in the chateau of Pierre-Encise by the archbishop of Lyon. Again, he successfully escaped, and decided to attack Lyon. The intervention of the Constable de Montmorency thwarted his attack however, and his attempt at independence failed. He died at Annecy in 1595, leaving the Duchy of Nemour to his brother Henri de Savoie.\n\nQuestion: Who is the child-in-law of Marie De Namur?": [

In 1890, he became Grand Duke of Luxembourg following the death of King William III of the Netherlands, ending the personal union between the Netherlands and Luxembourg, until his own death in 1905. He was the first monarch of Luxembourg from the House of Nassau-Weilburg. Adolphe became Duke of Nassau in August 1839, following the death of his father William. After Austria's defeat in Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Duchy of Nassau was annexed to Kingdom of Prussia and he lost his throne. From 1815 to 1839, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was ruled by the kings of the Netherlands as a province of the Netherlands. Following the Treaty of London (1839), Grand Duchy of Luxembourg became independent but remained in personal union with the Netherlands. Following the death of his sons, King William III of the Netherlands had no male heirs to succeed him. In the Netherlands, females were allowed to succeed to the throne. Luxembourg, however, followed Salic law which barred females from succession. Thus, upon King William III's death, the crown of the Netherlands passed to his only daughter, Wilhelmina, while that of Luxembourg passed to Adolphe in accordance with the Nassau Family Pact.

At the time of his birth, his paternal grandfather Alexander II was still the reigning Emperor of All the Russias. Michael was fourth-in-line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line and, in 1894, after the death of his father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir presumptive. The birth of Nicholas's son Alexei in 1904 moved Michael back to second-in-line, but Alexei was gravely-ill with hemophilia and Michael suspected the boy would die, leaving him as heir. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel to avoid scandal but this did not deter Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple's only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought Natalia to St. Petersburg where she was shunned by society. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying Natalia in the hope that he would be removed from the line of succession. Michael and Natalia left Russia to live in exile abroad in France, Switzerland and England. After the outbreak of World War I, Michael returned to Russia, assuming command of a cavalry regiment. When Nicholas abdicated on , Michael was named as his successor instead of Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He was never confirmed as Emperor and, following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandfather of Conrad Ii Of Italy?": [

However the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim. The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were \"exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature\" that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand. Indeed, in 2013 a claim of a Kiribati man of being a \"climate change refugee\" under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable as there was no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated Refugee Convention grounds. Permanent migration to Australia and New Zealand, such as for family reunification, requires compliance with the immigration legislation of those countries.\n\nQuestion: Who is Teriimaevarua Iii's paternal grandmother?": [

His maternal first cousins included Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford and Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex. He was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. He was tutored by John Leland during his youth. His mother, Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon had an affair with Henry VIII in 1510, the discovery of which led her husband to remove her to a convent and her brother to leave court in a rage, refusing to stay under Henry's roof. As late as 1513, Anne was the courtier who received the second most expensive New Year's gift from Henry, indicating that their relationship continued until then. However, there are no contemporary references to the possibility of Francis being an illegitimate son of the Tudor monarch. His father was created the first Earl of Huntingdon by Henry VIII of England on 3 November 1529. He was awarded stewardship over two abbeys in 1530.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of John Stafford, 1St Earl Of Wiltshire's father?": [

He was one of the seven children of Richard Comyn, Justiciar of Lothian, and Hextilda of Tynedale. He was born in Scotland, in Altyre, Moray in 1163 and died in Buchan in 1233 where he is buried in Deer Abbey. William made his fortune in the service of King William I of Scotland fighting the Meic Uilleim in the north. William witnesses no fewer than 88 charters of the king. William was sheriff of Forfar (1195\u20131211), Justiciar of Scotia (1205\u20131233) and warden of Moray (1211\u20132). Between 1199 and 1200, William was sent to England to discuss important matters on King William's behalf with the new king, John. William was appointed to the prestigious office of Justiciar of Scotia, the most senior royal office in the kingdom, in 1205. Between 1211 and 1212, William, as Warden of Moray (or \"Guardian of Moray\") fought against the insurgency of Gofraid mac Domnaill (of the Meic Uilleim family), whom William beheaded in Kincardine in 1213. Upon finally destroying the Meic Uilleim's in 1229, he was given the Lordship of Badenoch and the lands it controlled. From an unknown date, William held the title Lord of Kilbride. He helped oversee the construction of St Mungo's Cathedral in Glasgow and after his death, Marjory continued his work there.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Gwladys's husband?": [

Widely recognized as a pivotal figure in early jazz, Morton was jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential spirit and characteristics when notated. His composition \"Jelly Roll Blues\", published in 1915, was the first published jazz composition. Morton also wrote the standards \"King Porter StompWolverine BluesBlack Bottom Stomp\", and \"I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say\", the last a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century. Morton's claim to have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment. The jazz historian, musician, and composer Gunther Schuller says of Morton's \"hyperbolic assertions\" that there is \"no proof to the contrary\" and that Morton's \"considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation\". Alan Lomax, who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938, did not agree that Morton was an egotist: In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If we read the words that he himself wrote, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex and said that he created his own style of jazz piano because \"All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and I did not feel as though I was in their class.\" So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points\". --Quoted in John Szwed, \"Dr Jazz\".\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Dominick Basso or Ilse Lehiste?": [

He was also the older brother of Gulbadan Begum (the author of \"Humayun-nama\"), the younger half-brother of the second Mughal emperor Humayun, as well as the paternal uncle and father-in-law of the third Mughal emperor Akbar. Hindal's long military career started at the age of ten, with his first appointment as a viceroy being in Badakshan, Afghanistan. The young prince subsequently proved himself to be a successful and courageous general. Thus, by the age of 19, Hindal was considered to be a strong and favourable contender for the Mughal throne as Humayun's successor by the imperial council, which despised his older brother. However, unlike his rebellious half-brother, Kamran Mirza, Hindal eventually pledged allegiance to Humayun and remained faithful to him till his untimely death in 1551, when he died fighting valorously for the Mughals in a battle against Kamran Mirza's forces. He was survived by his wife and his only daughter, the princess Ruqaiya Sultan Begum, who married his nephew, Akbar, and became Mughal empress in 1556.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father-in-law of Rahmat Banu Begum?": [

He also served as Duke of Cieszyn. Born in Vienna on 8 September 1633, and baptised as \"Ferdinand Franz\", Ferdinand IV was the eldest son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. At a young age, Ferdinand IV took his father's role as Archduke of Austria. In 1646, Ferdinand IV became King of Bohemia as he shared the role with his father Emperor Ferdinand III. He was crowned on 5 August 1646, and also shared the role of Duke of Cieszyn with Ferdinand III. Ferdinand IV also shared the role as King of Hungary and Croatia with his father; his coronation took place on 16 June 1647 in Pressburg, present-day Slovakia. After the French attempted to modify the system of the election of King of the Romans, Emperor Ferdinand III made an opportunity of a recent decline in the prestige of France, and was able to install Ferdinand IV as King of the Romans, and \"de facto\" heir to the Holy Roman Empire. He was crowned in Ratisbon (Regensburg, present-day south-east Germany) on 18 June 1653 after gaining the position on 31 May 1653. However, Ferdinand IV unexpectedly died of smallpox in Vienna on 9 July 1654, and was later succeeded by his brother Leopold I as King of the Romans. Prior to his death, it was planned that he would marry Philip IV of Spain's daughter Maria Theresa of Spain, his cousin.
