Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods. Because of oil price increases after 2003, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) per day and was projected to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700,000 m3) per day by 2020. The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 billion barrels (50\u00d710^9 m3), which at a rate of 4,400,000 barrels per day (700,000 m3/d) would last about 200 years.\nDocument[3](Title: Cleveland Park station) Cleveland Park is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.

In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 US study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.\nDocument[2](Title: Winter Spring Summer Fall (album)) Winter Spring Summer Fall is the debut mixtape by American record producer, singer-songwriter, rapper and musician Boots.\nDocument[3](Title: Deuce High) Deuce High is a 1926 silent film western directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Buffalo Bill Jr. (a.k.a.

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the \"Collateral Murder\" video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks. In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange, after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault. Assange denied the allegations, and said they were just a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010 but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his \u00a3340,000 bail in June 2012 to seek asylum from Ecuador. In August 2012, Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and possible extradition to the United States. In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship; however it was suspended in April 2019. Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years. During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State. The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts of interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread the stolen documents. Assange consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\". On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested. Later that day he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom. On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act. As a result of the revocation of his asylum, and at the request of his alleged rape victim's lawyer, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019. In November 2019, they dropped the investigation, citing weakened evidence due to the time lapse after the alleged offence.

Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \"noise\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.\nDocument[3](Title: Hurley High School (Missouri)) Hurley High School is a public high school located in Hurley, Missouri.

According to English historian John Julius Norwich, his nickname came from \"his early-ingrained habit of counting and recounting his money.\" In 1073, Sichelgaita had Roger proclaimed heir after Guiscard fell ill at Trani. Roger's cousin Abelard was the only baron to dissent from the election of Roger, claiming that he was the rightful heir to the duchy. Roger accompanied his father on a campaign to Greece in 1084. He was still in Greece when his father died on 17 July 1085 in Kefalonia. While Bohemond was supposed to inherit the Greek possessions and Roger the Italian ones, it was Bohemund who was in Italy (Salerno) and Roger in Greece (Bundicia) at the time of the Guiscard's passing. Roger rejoined his mother on Cephalonia, his absence causing panic and confusion with his army, according to Goffredo Malaterra. The two quickly returned to the peninsula and with the support of Roger I of Sicily, his uncle, was recognised as duke in September. His Lombard heritage also made him a more attractive candidate than his Norman half-brother, who had fled to Capua. With the support of Jordan I of Capua, Bohemund rebelled against his brother and took Oria, Otranto, and Taranto. Roger, however, made peace in March 1086 and the brothers acted as effective co-rulers. In late Summer 1087, Bohemond renewed the war with the support of some of his brother's vassals. He surprised and defeated Roger at Fragneto and retook Taranto. Though described as a powerful warrior (he took the cities of Benevento, Canosa, Capua, and Lucera by siege), Roger Borsa was never able to check Bohemund's power or bring him under his control. The war was finally resolved by the mediation of Pope Urban II and the award of Taranto and other possessions to Bohemund. Roger also granted him Cosenza and other holdings he desired allodially. In 1089 Roger Borsa was officially invested with the duchy of Apulia by Pope Urban II. Roger permitted the minting of baronial coinage in at least two instances (Fulco of Basacers and Manso \"vicedux\"). He planned to urbanise the Mezzogiorno by granting charters to various towns and encouraging urban planning. In 1090, he and Urban encouraged Bruno of Cologne, founder of the Carthusian Order to accept election to the archbishopric of Reggio di Calabria. In May 1098, at the request of his first cousin once removed, Prince Richard II of Capua, Borsa and his uncle Count Roger I of Sicily began the siege of Capua, from which the prince had long ago been exiled as a minor. In exchange for his assistance, the duke received the homage of Richard, though he seems to have made no use of it, for Richard's successors paid no heed to Roger Borsa's overlordship. Capua fell after forty days of notable besieging, for Pope Urban II had come to meet Roger of Sicily and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury had come to meet the pope. In October 1104, Roger besieged William, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo, who was at that time independent and pledged to the Byzantines, and expelled him from the Gargano, abolishing the county.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Remigius Of Rouen's father?": [

Anastasio Somoza started a dynasty that maintained absolute control over Nicaragua for 55 years. The son of a wealthy coffee planter, Somoza was educated in the United States. After his return to Nicaragua, he helped oust President Adolfo D\u00edaz. He became the foreign secretary and took the title of \"General\". With the help of the US Marine Corps, which occupied Nicaragua at the time, Somoza became the head of the National Guard. This gave him the power base to remove his wife's uncle, Juan Bautista Sacasa, from the presidency, and make himself president in 1937. In 1947, an ally nominally succeeded him, but he retained power. A month after his successor had been inaugurated, Somoza used the military to carry out a coup. The president was declared 'incapacitated' by Congress and Somoza served in his stead. Returning to power in his own name in 1951, he maintained an iron grip on his own Liberal Party while making a deal with the Conservatives; thus, he faced no opposition. This left him free to amass a huge personal fortune. On 21 September 1956, he was shot by poet Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez. Mortally wounded, he was flown to the Panama Canal Zone where he died a week later.

His term was completed by Lorenzo Guerrero. In 1967 his younger brother Anastasio Somoza Debayle was elected to serve until 1972. He was reelected in 1974 after a Constituent Assembly that lasted from 1972 to 1974. During that time the country was ruled by a coalition junta of conservatives and Liberals.

HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.\nDocument[2](Title: Robert Stevens (lawyer)) Robert Bocking Stevens( born 8 June 1933) is a British lawyer and academic.\nDocument[3](Title: Scott Spann) Scott Spann, Jr.( born May 11, 1988) is an American competition swimmer and Pan American Games medalist.\nDocument[4](Title: Jo Planckaert) Jo Planckaert( born 16 December 1970 in Deinze) is a former Belgian professional road bicycle racer.

The film follows a Union soldier- turned- drifter and his companion, a mixed- race prostitute, who become embroiled in a bitter, destructive feud between a gang of Confederate Red Shirts and a band of Mexican revolutionaries. Intended to capitalize on and rival the success of Sergio Leone's\" A Fistful of Dollars\", Corbucci's film is, like Leone's, considered to be a loose, unofficial adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's\" Yojimbo\". The film earned a reputation as one of the most violent films ever made at the time, and was subsequently refused a certificate in the United Kingdom until 1993, when it was issued an 18 certificate( the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004). A commercial success upon release,\" Django\" has garnered a large cult following outside of Italy and is widely regarded as one of the best films of the Spaghetti Western genre, with the direction, Nero's performance, and Luis Bacalov's soundtrack most frequently being praised. Although the name is referenced in over thirty\" sequels\" from the time of the film's release until the early 1970s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, most of these films were unofficial, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero reprised his role as Django in 1987's\" Django Strikes Again\", the only official sequel produced with Corbucci's involvement. Nero also made a cameo appearance in Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film\" Django Unchained\", as homage to Corbucci's original.

Over the forty years, since the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, the power of the emperor had gradually fallen into the hands of his provincial viceroys or Subahdars.  The dominant rulers on the Coromandel Coast were the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah I, and the Nawab of the Carnatic, Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan.  The nawab nominally owed fealty to the nizam, but in many respects acted independently.  Fort St. George and the French trading post at Pondicherry were both located in the nawab's territory.The relationship between the Europeans in the region was influenced by a series of wars and treaties in Europe, and by commercial rivalries for trade on the subcontinent.  Through the 17th and early 18th centuries, the French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British had vied for control of various trading posts, and for trading rights and favour with local Indian rulers.  The European merchant companies raised bodies of troops to protect their commercial interests and latterly to influence local politics to their advantage.

Ellis grew up in the Boston area, attending Lexington High School. One of his teachers introduced him to the music program at Boston's Berklee College of Music, where Ellis would study music composition starting in the late 1970s, earning his degree between gigs over the next fifteen years. Ellis had a long association with the continuously evolving Off-Broadway satirical revue \" Forbidden Broadway'where he met his wife, comedienne Eydie Alyson. His Brad Ellis Little Big Band has released recordings, as produced by Bruce Kimmel. Ellis arranged, orchestrated and conducted members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for their 2006 album \"Unexpected Dreams: Songs from the Stars\", in support of the Philharmonic's \"Music Matters\" fund for music education. The album featured performances by TV and film stars including Victor Garber, Lucy Lawless, and Scarlett Johansson.

The enigmatic role has led to Ellis being featured in interviews with \"People\" magazine, CNN.com, National Public Radio and Entertainment Weekly. In 2009, Ellis was part of the team that created the music and lyrics for the opening number for 81st Academy Awards telecast, as performed by Oscar host Hugh Jackman.

In 2011, Ellis worked with Robert Ulrich, casting director for \"Glee\", on the first special episode of \"The Glee Project\", coaching 80 potential candidates for the show. He was featured in the music segment of the special one-hour \"Audition Process\" episode that teased in the pilot of \"The Glee Project\". To the delight and surprise of many \"Glee\" fans, he spoke on the show. In July, 2013, Ellis was pianist for \"Glee\" star Matthew Morrison's run at the 54 Below nightclub in Manhattan. The show opened the same night that \"Glee\" co-star Cory Monteith died, so the two opened each subsequent show with the song \" What I Did For Love\", from \"A Chorus Line\", as a tribute to Monteith. Ellis continues to be the music director, orchestrator and arranger for Matthew Morrison as he tours performing with major symphony orchestras, and in cabaret venues throughout the world.

Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sassanians and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held \"de facto\" power throughout his reign. In 270, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to southern Egypt, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to Roman emperor Aurelian's campaign in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress (declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome). The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life. Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.\nDocument[2](Title: Gaspary's Sons) Gaspary's Sons  is a 1948 German drama film directed by Rolf Meyer and starring Lil Dagover, Hans St\u00fcwe and Inge Landgut.

He reigned from 180 to 164 BC and from 163 to 145 BC. The eldest son of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I of Egypt, he came to the throne as a very young child in 180 BC and the kingdom was governed by regents: his mother until her death in 178 or 177 BC and then two of her associates, Eulaeus and Lenaeus until 169 BC. From 170 BC, his sister-wife Cleopatra II and his younger brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes were co-rulers alongside him. Ptolemy VI's reign was characterised by external conflict with the Seleucid empire over Syria and by internal conflict with his younger brother for control of the Ptolemaic monarchy. In the Sixth Syrian War (170-168 BC), the Ptolemaic forces were utterly defeated and Egypt was twice invaded by Seleucid armies. His attempts to negotiate an end to this conflict exacerbated the conflict with his brother. Though he managed to collaborate with his brother for long enough to secure peace and re-establish order within Egypt, Ptolemy VIII succeeded in expelling Ptolemy VI from Egypt in 164 BC. The people of Alexandria turned against Ptolemy VIII and invited Ptolemy VI back to the throne in 163 BC. In this second reign he was much more successful in both conflicts. He banished his brother to Cyrenaica and repeatedly prevented him from using that as a springboard to taking Cyprus, despite substantial Roman intervention in his brother's favour. By supporting a series of rival claimants for the Seleucid throne, Ptolemy VI helped instigate a civil war in the Seleucid realm, which would continue for generations and eventually consume the Seleucid dynasty. In 145 BC, Ptolemy invaded Seleucid Syria and won a total victory at the Battle of the Oenoparus, which left him in charge of both the Seleucid and Ptolemaic realms. However, injuries that he sustained in the battle led to his death three days later. The gains from the war were almost immediately lost and his brother Ptolemy VIII returned to power.\nDocument[4](Title: Trouble Makers (2006 film)) Trouble Makers is a 2006 black comedy film written and directed by Cao Baoping.

The first known book on the`` leaf'' game was called the Yezi Gexi and allegedly written by a Tang woman. It received commentary by writers of subsequent dynasties. The Song dynasty (960 -- 1279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007 -- 1072) asserts that the ``leaf ''game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated its invention with the development of printed sheets as a writing medium. However, Ouyang also claims that the`` leaves'' were pages of a book used in a board game played with dice, and that the rules of the game were lost by 1067.\nDocument[5](Title: Subway Academy I) Subway Academy I is a public alternative high school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Originally, Subway Academy I was simply called \"Subway Academy\", but after Subway Academy II opened, the name was changed to \"Subway Academy I\". It was founded in September 1973, making it one of the oldest secondary alternative schools in Toronto. The original staff were Achim Krull, Judith Robertson and Murray Shukyn. The school was a reflection of the Ivan Illich \"deschooling\" movement, which proposed that people would learn best from community resources. As a result, a directory of resources along the Toronto subway system was created, and the school derives its name from that initiative. The community resource aspect of the program however faded very quickly. Students were more interested in formal credit courses and academic courses leading to admission to university or college admission. Subway Academy started as an independent studies program. It was intended to make education available to students with family or other obligations which limited their ability to attend school during regular hours and who could not attend night school. The school enrolled students at any time during the year, not just in September. Originally, there was no upper age limit on enrolment. The school attracted many adults. The independent studies program at Subway Academy operated very differently from regular high school programs. Students met their teachers by appointment several times a week, but there were no formal classes. During the appointments, students reviewed their progress with their teachers, wrote tests, handed in assignments, and received new work. Students could work at the school, or at home, or at the local library, wherever they were comfortable. Students started courses when they joined, and finished courses whenever they had completed all the required work. Additional courses could be started at any time. Today Subway Academy combined formal classes with independent studies, and students are required to complete courses during a regular semestered timeframe. Subway Academy One continues to share a building with Eastern Commerce Collegiate Institute. Today it offers courses from grades 9 to 12 at both the academic and applied level. As the enrolment at Subway Academy increased, it was divided into two branches. Subway Academy II was opened in the west end of Toronto. Judith Robertson became the first coordinator of that program. It continues today as an independent studies program.\nDocument[6](Title: Ricardo Lopes de Oliveira) Ricardo Lopes de Oliveira( born 28 October 1976) is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Am\u00e9rica de Natal.\n\nQuestion: When is Prince Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's father's birthday?": [

She was the daughter of Emperor Galerius and his first wife, whose name is unknown. She married Maxentius around 293 (the exact date is unknown) in what was likely an attempt to forge an alliance between the families of Galerius and Maxentius' father Maximian, himself Emperor in the West. She bore two sons: the eldest, Valerius Romulus, was born c. 295; the other son's name is not recorded, but might be Aurelius Valerius, who was executed in 312. As an emperor's daughter, she was entitled \"nobilissima femina\". Her husband was acclaimed emperor in October 306 against the wishes of Valeria Maximilla's father, who tried to overthrow the usurper in 307 but without success. Maxentius remained the ruler of Rome, Italy and Africa until 312, when Constantine I invaded Italy.

It is in the civil parish of Eckington. Renishaw lies on the A6135 road between the villages of Eckington and Barlborough. To the west is a section of the Trans Pennine Trail long distance footpath which runs along a former railway line. Adjacent to this is the route of the Chesterfield Canal which passes along the edge of the village. The canal is being restored in stages, with this section having some clearance work done in preparation for the section from Staveley to the south being reinstated. While Renishaw is the name for the village as a whole, in respect of the group of roads that lie south of the A6135, in the section of the highway that is locally named as Main Road( between Hague Lane( B6419) and Emmett Carr Lane), that part is named Emmett Carr. To the north west of the village is Renishaw Hall, a country house belonging to the Sitwell family, who were owners of the local iron foundry before it was nationalised. The Sitwell estate is now occupied in part by Renishaw Park Golf course. Renishaw Ironworks founded by the 17th- century ironmaster, George Sitwell was the main employer in the village for many years before its closure in the 1990s, when British Steel plc closed down non-core parts of its business. The site is now part business park and part housing estate. The other main employer in the area was the mining industry as the area had several pits some of which originally supplied the iron works. The route of the Midland Railway from Chesterfield to Sheffield passed the village in the valley to the west, before the direct route through Dronfield and the Bradway Tunnel to the Sheffield Midland station was built. This route was the North Midland Railway from Derby to Leeds.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mother of Edward I Of England?": [

Weigold was born in Dresden. He studied natural sciences and geography in Jena and Leipzig. Here he was influenced by Ernst Haeckel, Richard Woltereck, Otto zur Strassen and Carl Chun. He worked for the Scientific Commission for Marine Research in Heligoland, a German island in the North Sea, where he continued the work of Heinrich G\u00e4tke( who died in 1897) in bird migration studies, setting up the bird observatory in 1910 to trap and band the migratory birds passing through the island. For six years Weigold carried out zoological research in China and Tibet and was the first Westerner to see a live giant panda in the wild, buying a cub( which did not survive for long) while part of the Stoetzner Expedition in 1916. He later became Director of Natural Sciences at the Lower Saxony State Museum in Hanover. He died in Bruckberg, Lower Bavaria. Weigold collected a large number of specimens, nearly 3800 during his 1913- 16 expedition and 1000 from 1931- 32. He named 5 subspecies alone and 7 co-authored with Otto Kleinschmidt.

One of his notable subjects of research is the fall of the fort of Masada, the last refuge of a Jewish group, the Sicarii, to the Romans in 73 CE. The Sicarii committed mass suicide rather than surrender to slavery. He views the story of Masada as a modern legend. According to his book\" Sacrificing Truth\", the rendition of Josephus was embellished before and after the establishment of the State of Israel. Based on transcripts of the 1963- 65 archaeological dig, he claims that the team, led by Yigael Yadin, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, fraudulently misrepresented findings and artifacts to fit within a pre-scripted narrative. Ben-Yehuda compared the story as reported in the sole historical source, Flavius Josephus, to the myth that developed during the Zionist movement from the 1940s to the 1960s. He examined how archaeologists, notably Yigael Yadin, interpreted their findings to conform to the myth. According to Ben -Yehuda, Josephus describes the Sicarii unflatteringly. They assassinated their Jewish opponents, and would not help the Jewish Zealots who were besieged in Jerusalem. They raided nearby villages, including Ein Gedi, where they murdered 700 Jewish women and children. They offered no resistance to the Romans, and their suicide was cowardly, unheroic and unwise. Ben-Yehuda himself was brought up on the Masada myth, and climbed Masada himself to watch the sun rise over the Dead Sea. Israeli youth movements visited Masada, and it was the location for military swearing- in ceremonies. According to the myth, the Jews at Masada were Zealots who escaped the destruction of Jerusalem and continued to harass the Romans. Ben- Yehuda quotes Moshe Dayan calling Masada\" a symbol of heroism and of Liberty for the Jewish people to whom it says: Fight to death rather than surrender.\" Contrary to Josephus, the myth claims that the rebels are\" Zealots\" rather than Sicarii, Masada was a rebel base for attacks on the Romans. The massacre in Ein Geddi disappears. Ben-Yehuda compared Yadin's tape- recorded notes during the excavations with Yadin's later statements. For example, Yadin found three skeletons, of a woman, a man and a child. On the tape, Yadin said that they could not have been a family. In later writings, Yadin said that they were the remains of an important commander, his wife, and their child. Ben-Yehuda believes that Yadin's distortions were ideologically motivated.\nDocument[6](Title: Yuki Midorikawa) She is primarily known for her sh\u014djo manga works in the magazines\" LaLa\" and\" LaLa DX\", published by Hakusensha.

Ralph entered Parliament in 1814 as member for Westbury, a pocket borough controlled by his uncle, for which he initially sat until 1819. On his uncle's death in 1831 he inherited both the baronetcy and his estate, a condition of which was that he change his surname to Lopes. Included in the estate was the right to nominate the MPs at Westbury( though this did not survive the Great Reform Act of the following year), and he resumed his seat for the borough. Although he had originally sat as a Tory like his uncle, he now expressed his support for the Reform Bill and sat with the Whigs. Having been three times elected unopposed, Ralph switched his loyalties during the 1835 Parliament from the Whigs back to the Conservatives, and at the 1837 election a Whig candidate stood against him and defeated him, by the narrow margin of 98 votes to 96.

The short films feature Lester Speight as \"Terrible\" Terry Tate, an American football linebacker who \"gives out the pain\" to those in the office who are not obeying office policies. Originally, Reebok produced 6 episodes between August to December 2002 with another episode \"Terry Tate, Office Linebacker: Sensitivity Training\" being made on February 1, 2004. Even Reebok in the United Kingdom made an episode called \"Late Lunch\" on January 22, 2005. There are a total of 9 episodes.

After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. Issued at the start of the Great Depression, the records did not sell and did not lead to national recognition. Locally, House remained popular, and in the 1930s, together with Patton's associate Willie Brown, he was the leading musician of Coahoma County. There he was a formative influence on Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. In 1941 and 1942, House and the members of his band were recorded by Alan Lomax and John W. Work for the Library of Congress and Fisk University. The following year, he left the Delta for Rochester, New York, and gave up music. In 1964, a group of young record collectors discovered House, whom they knew of from his records issued by Paramount and by the Library of Congress. With their encouragement, he relearned his repertoire and established a career as an entertainer, performing for young, mostly white audiences in coffeehouses, at folk festivals and on concert tours during the American folk music revival, billed as a \"folk blues\" singer. He recorded several albums, and some informally taped concerts have also been issued as albums. House died in 1988. In 2017, his single, \"Preachin' the Blues\" was inducted in to the Blues Hall of Fame.\nDocument[2](Title: Princess Ulrike Friederike Wilhelmine of Hesse-Kassel) Princess Ulrike Friederike Wilhelmine of Hesse-Kassel () (31 October 1722, Kassel \u2013 28 February 1787, Eutin) was a member of the House of Hesse-Kassel by birth, and of the House of Holstein-Gottorp through her marriage to Frederick Augustus I, Duke of Oldenburg.

They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848\u20131925) and Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.\nDocument[3](Title: Karin Daughter of Ingmar) Karin Daughter of Ingmar is a 1920 Swedish silent drama film directed by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.

He claimed to be the largest independent gun dealer in the United States, and his store has been called the largest public display of firearms in America. For a while, he operated multiple 24- hour stores in the Indianapolis area. On October 8, 1997, Davis' Greenwood, Indiana, store was robbed, and an employee shot and killed. Soon after the incident, he closed all his stores except for the Lafayette Road flagship store, which reduced its business hours. On September 17, 2012, a customer visiting the store to utilize its indoor shooting range intentionally shot a store employee twice. The employee immediately returned fire, killing his attacker. Davis was named among the top five dealers who sell guns to criminals by the U.S. Department of Justice, ranked at# 4. He said that the problem was not with his selling the guns, which requires FBI screening, but with those who purchase them and privately resell them, which he describes as a major loophole in the gun control laws. Some area residents feel that Davis catered to a less- than- upstanding clientele, largely profiting from inflated prices for people that have been described as dubious. Davis was a vocal proponent of the Brady Bill. He later called the bill largely ineffective because of its wording, which does not ban guns by type or firing capacity, but rather by specific technical attributes. Davis was locally known for his late night television commercials. \" Indianapolis Magazine\" voted them as the worst Indianapolis- based commercials in 1984 and 1985. He traditionally ended them with his slogan,\" I do n't want to make any money. I just love to sell guns, heh- heh- heh.\" Davis was interviewed by NPR's Michele Norris on\" All Things Considered\" to discuss the sunset of the Brady Bill.

Dylan has performed \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\" live on several of his tours. Since its initial appearance on \"Bringing It All Back Home\", live versions of the song have been released on a number of Dylan's albums, including \"Bob Dylan at BudokanMTV Unplugged\" (European versions), and , as well as on the reissued \"Concert for Bangladesh\" album by George Harrison & Friends.

He was educated at Hurstpierpoint College, where he later acted as Assistant Master between 1872 and 1873, and matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1873. He emigrated to South Africa where he played an active role in establishing British settlement in Rhodesia. He served with the Bechuanaland Field Force under Sir Charles Warren during the Warren Expedition in Bechuanaland in 1884 and 1885, and in Mashonaland between 1889 and 1896. Maund was one of three officers sent to inform Lobengula that Britain had declared Bechuanaland a protectorate. He realised the commercial potential of Mashonaland and interested George Cawston, a London financier, in procuring mining rights and Lord Gifford who had obtained substantial mineral rights in Northern Bechuanaland, and sought to extend his mining concessions to Mashonaland. Maund left for Bulawayo to negotiate terms. Rhodes had got wind of this and hurriedly sent off his own party consisting of Charles Rudd, Rochfort Maguire and Frank Thompson. On 30 October 1888, through political subterfuge involving Governor Robinson( later rewarded with a large number of shares in the British South Africa Company) and Sir Sydney Shippard, Rhodes obtained the mineral rights later to be called the Rudd Concession. Maund disputed the concession and set off for London with two of Lobengula's indunas to see Queen Victoria, report on the trickery perpetrated by Rhodes and ask for her advice and assistance. Maund and his party returned to Bulawayo, armed with a letter from the Colonial Secretary, Lord Knutsford to Lobengula advising him to be cautious. Rhodes now sought amalgamation of all the interested parties with a view to obtaining a Royal Charter. Maund was obliged to support this new move, much to Lobengula's suspicion. The tense situation was relieved by the arrival of Dr. Jameson, news that the Charter had been granted and further letters from the Colonial Secretary. Maund played no further political part, but was active in the development of Salisbury. Maund was married to Elenora Maund with daughter Cecily Elenora Niele Maund, born in Salisbury on 12 April 1895 and sponsored at her baptism by Cecil John Rhodes and Leander Starr Jameson.\nDocument[4](Title: Robert Lepage) Robert Lepage, (born December 12, 1957) is a Canadian playwright, actor, film director, and stage director.\nDocument[5](Title: State Theatre (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)) The State Theatre is a venue for the performing arts and entertainment, located in downtown Eau Claire, Wisconsin with seating for 1100 people.\nDocument[6](Title: Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation) Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation is a 1953 American comedy film directed by Charles Lamont.

Once the leading political power in Leicestershire, his family had declined in influence; regaining that position became his primary ambition and drove his political choices. During the 1679 to 1681 Exclusion Crisis, he supported the removal from the succession of the Catholic heir, James, Duke of York, before switching allegiance in 1681. James succeeded as king in 1685 with widespread support but this collapsed when his religious measures and the methods used to enforce them seemed to undermine the legal system and the Church of England. By the end of 1687, Huntingdon was one of the few non-Catholics who continued to actively implement his policies. While changing sides was common in this period, and after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, a sizeable minority continued to view James as the legitimate monarch, primacy of the Church of England was non-negotiable. Huntingdon was considered to have actively persecuted his own church, a distinction that damaged his reputation among his contemporaries. One of 30 individuals excluded from the 1690 Act of Grace, he lost his offices but continued to attend the House of Lords and remained a committed Jacobite. He was arrested and charged with treason in 1692, although charges were later dropped; shortly before his death in May 1701, he was one of five peers who voted against the 1701 Act of Settlement barring Catholics from the throne.\nDocument[5](Title: Jack Lovelock) John Edward Lovelock (5 January 1910 \u2013 28 December 1949) was a New Zealand athlete who became the world 1500m and mile record holder and 1936 Olympic champion in the 1500 metres.\nDocument[6](Title: Malucha Pinto) Malucha Pinto Solari( born 16 April 1955) is a Chilean actress, theater director, and playwright.\n\nQuestion: Do director of film Jerry And Tom and director of film Kansas City Princess share the same nationality?": [

The English titles for the first season are accorded to the names used by Funimation Entertainment. English titles in the other seasons are not official. The first season entitled. It was produced by Studio Deen and directed by Chiaki Kon. It was released in English by Geneon and Funimation, under the title\" When They Cry \u2013 Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\". The first season contains twenty six episodes and aired between April 4 and September 26, 2006 on a number of Japanese television networks, including Chiba TV, Kansai TV and Tokai TV. The story follows a group of five young friends and the strange events that occur in their village of Hinamizawa. A string of unexplained murders have plagued the town for the past three years during the annual Watanagashi Festival in June, and with the next Watanagashi approaching, things start to take a turn for the worse. The series is divided into six chapters which are based on the first six chapters in the original visual novel series. The first chapter is\" Onikakushi- hen\"( episodes one to four), followed by\" Watanagashi- hen\"( episodes five to eight), and\" Tatarigoroshi- hen\"( episodes nine to thirteen). Next is\" Himatsubushi- hen\"( episodes fourteen and fifteen), the shortest of the story arcs. The last two chapters are\" Meakashi- hen\"( episodes sixteen to twenty- one) and\" Tsumihoroboshi- hen\"( episodes twenty- two through twenty- six). The second season entitled. It was produced by the same team and contains twenty- four episodes. The series aired in Japan between July 6 and December 17, 2007 on several Japanese television networks, such as Sun TV, TV Kanagawa and TV Saitama. The story is similar to the first season, and what was left unexplained in the first season is explained over the course of three separate story arcs. The first story is an anime-original arc called\" Yakusamashi- hen\", which is followed by the last two arcs from the original visual novel series:\" Minagoroshi- hen\" and\" Matsuribayashi- hen\".

It is notable for the period it was made in as well as the popular musical acts that featured in it. Sir Howard Morrison, Eddie Low, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Herma and Eliza Keil of the Keil Isles featured in the film. It also had an appearance by Australian hit maker Normie Rowe. Directed by John O'Shea and written by Joseph Musaphia, the film captures the exuberance and energy of one of New Zealand's finest hours in pop/ rock musical history. Fashioned in the style of Richard Lester's\" A Hard Day's Night\"( 1964) and\" Help!\"( 1965), it is a showcase for the talents of the period, including Kiri te Kanawa(\" Sing for us now, Kiri\"). The songs are mostly written by Patrick Flynn in collaboration with either O'Shea or Musaphia. However, the film is also a knockabout romantic comedy: the dialogue non-sequiturs, pratfall gags and bizarre juxtapositions display an offbeat sense of irony and blase manner not unlike that of television in the late Eighties( Terry and the Gunrunners and The Billy T. James Show, for example).

Gilles Carle, who was a key figure in the development of a commercial Qu\u00e9bec cinema, worked as a graphic artist and writer before he joined the National Film Board of Canada in 1960. His innovative debut feature, \"La Vie heureuse de L\u00e9opold Z.\", tracked the adventures of a snowplough operator during a madcap Christmas Eve. But after the NFB rejected several of his projects, he began working independently. In 1971 Carle joined forces with Pierre Lamy to form Les Productions Carle-Lamy, which produced Claude Jutra\u2019s epic \"Kamouraska\", Denys Arcand\u2019s early features and all his early films. The quirkily paced, proto-feminist \"La Vraie Nature de Bernadette\" \u2013 widely regarded as his best film \u2013 and \"Le Mort d\u2019un b\u00fbcheron\" eventually led to the more mainstream but graceful \"Les Plouffe\" and the epic love story \"Maria Chapdelaine\", both classics of Quebec cinema. In 1972 Carle won the Canadian Film Award for best Director for his \"The True Nature of Bernadette\". Carle was born in Maniwaki, Quebec. His film \"50 ans\", celebrating the \"50 years\" of the National Film Board of Canada, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

He was raised to the high rank of \"sebastokrator\" by his older brother John II Komnenos in reward for his support, but they later fell out, as Isaac began to covet the throne. In 1130, Isaac and his sons fled to exile after becoming involved in a conspiracy against John. For several years, they wandered in Asia Minor and the Levant, trying to gain support from the local rulers, but ultimately in vain. John's military successes forced Isaac to seek a reconciliation with his brother in 1138, although he did not give up his designs on the throne. In 1139, after his oldest son defected to the Seljuk Turks, Isaac was exiled to Heraclea Pontica. During the struggle for John's succession in 1143, he supported the unsuccessful candidacy of his elder nephew, likewise named Isaac, over his younger nephew Manuel I Komnenos. In 1150, weakened by the onset of an illness, he was forced to retire from public life by Manuel. Isaac then devoted himself to the construction of the monastery of Theotokos Kosmosoteira at Bera (modern Feres) in western Thrace, where he was to be buried. Isaac was noted for his erudition and his patronage of learning, and is considered the author of a number of scholarly and poetic works. He is also notable for rebuilding the Chora Church in Constantinople, where his mosaic donor portrait survives to this day. His younger son Andronikos I Komnenos eventually managed to realize Isaac's ambitions, becoming emperor in 1183\u20131185, the last of the Komnenian dynasty.\nDocument[4](Title: Antikarisma) Antikarisma is an Iranian rockband formed by Iranian singer Shahin Najafi on 17 January 2010.\nDocument[5](Title: Lakselva) Lakselva (; ) is a river in Finnmark county in northern Norway.

The title may well be based upon Spring-heeled Jack, a semi-fantastical character from English folklore, alleged sightings and lurid press reports said to be able to make phenomenal leaps. The song features several samples from \"We Are the Lambeth Boys\", a 1959 British documentary by Karel Reisz about the daily activities of members of the Alford House Youth Club, Kennington in late 1950s London. The dialogue excerpted is from two conversations, one about a fight between two groups of young men and another about the abolition of the death penalty. The lyrics of the song seem to be about a man who has gone through his life having lots of sex, but not 'slowing down' to embrace romance with one person. The lyric 'He'll \"do\" but never be \"done to\", as well as the usual crude sexual imagery common to Morrissey songs suggests the man refuses to let his lovers penetrate his emotional self. \" Well it's the normal thing to do\"; some men don't believe emotional intimacy is needed or something in their comfort zone so they have only shallow relationships. The song ends on its last verse with the man in old age wondering \"where did all the time go?\".\nDocument[3](Title: James Hormel) James Catherwood Hormel( born January 1, 1933) is an American philanthropist and a former United States Ambassador to Luxembourg; appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1999, Hormel was the first openly LGBT person to serve as a U.S. Ambassador and is a noted LGBT activist.\nDocument[4](Title: Etudes (Charlie Haden album)) Etudes is an album by the American jazz bassist Charlie Haden recorded in 1987 and released on the Italian Soul Note label.\nDocument[5](Title: Samuel Arthur Saunder) Samuel Arthur Saunder (1852 \u2013 December 8, 1912) was a British mathematician and selenographer who taught at Wellington College, Berkshire.

It was directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent. It is the final installment in Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" trilogy. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris and J. K. Simmons. Set shortly after the events of \"Spider-Man 2\", as Peter Parker prepares his future with Mary Jane Watson, he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote, bringing out his anger while facing three villains: Uncle Ben's true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the Sandman after a freak accident; Harry Osborn, who seeks to avenge his father; and Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who becomes Venom after acquiring Peter's symbiote.\nDevelopment of \"Spider-Man 3\" began immediately after the release of \"Spider-Man 2\" for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created over 900 visual effects shots.

The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the most successful film of the trilogy, the third-highest-grossing film of 2007 and was the highest-grossing \"Spider-Man\" film until it was surpassed by  in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, \"Spider-Man 3\" received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the performances, visual effects and action sequences, but criticized the overloaded storylines and subplots, alongside the unrefined pacing and overabundance of villains including the portrayal of Venom. The majority of these issues were later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi and Arad. A fourth installment, titled \"Spider-Man 4\", was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a \"Venom\" spin-off film, but both were cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The \"Spider-Man\" film series was rebooted twice; first with \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (2012) by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield; and later a new film series set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, beginning with  (2017). The \"Venom\" spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with \"Venom\", set within Sony's Marvel Universe directed by Ruben Fleischer.\n\nQuestion: Who did Joan Ramon Ii, Count Of Cardona marry?": [

It was discovered photographically, when the comet was in outburst and the magnitude was about 13. Precovery images of the comet from March 4, 1902, were found in 1931 and showed the comet at 12th magnitude. The comet is unusual in that while normally hovering at around 16th magnitude, it suddenly undergoes an outburst. This causes the comet to brighten by 1 to 5 magnitudes. This happens with a frequency of 7.3 outbursts per year, fading within a week or two. The magnitude of the comet has been known to vary from 18th magnitude to 10th magnitude, a more than thousand- fold increase in brightness, during its brightest outbursts. Outbursts are very sudden, rising to maximum in about 2 hours, which is indicative of their cryovolcanic origin; and with the times of outburst modulated by an underlying 57- day periodicity possibly suggesting that its large nucleus is an extremely slow rotator. The comet is a member of a relatively new class of objects called\" Centaurs\", of which at least 400 are known. These are small icy bodies with orbits between those of Jupiter and Neptune. Astronomers believe that Centaurs have been recently perturbed inward from the Kuiper belt, a disk of Trans- Neptunian Objects occupying a region extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. Frequent perturbations by Jupiter will likely accumulate and cause the comet to migrate either inward or outward by the year 4000. The dust and gas comprising the comet's nucleus is part of the same primordial materials from which the Sun and planets were formed billions of years ago. The complex carbon- rich molecules they contain may have provided some of the raw materials from which life originated on Earth. The comet nucleus is estimated to be in diameter. 29 P reached perihelion on March 7, 2019 and opposition on October 9, 2019.\nDocument[4](Title: Barry Alvarez) Barry Lee Alvarez( born December 30, 1946) is a former American football coach who is currently the athletic director at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison.

Morgan) Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Edgworth Morgan (5 February 1894 \u2013 19 March 1967) was a senior officer of the British Army who fought in both world wars. He is best known as the chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), the original planner of Operation Overlord. A graduate of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Morgan was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery in 1913. During the First World War he served on the Western Front as an artillery subaltern and staff officer. Afterwards he served two long tours with the British Army in India. Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Morgan was promoted to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division, which he led during the Battle of France. In May 1942 he became a lieutenant-general and given command of I Corps. Morgan's headquarters was designated Force 125, and given the task of dealing with a German thrust through Spain to Gibraltar that never occurred. In March 1943 he was appointed chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate), or COSSAC. As COSSAC he directed the planning for Operation Overlord. When General Dwight D. Eisenhower became Supreme Allied Commander, Major General Bedell Smith became chief of staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), while Morgan became deputy chief of staff. After the war, Morgan served as Chief of Operations for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Germany until his position in Germany was eliminated following publication of \"off the record\" comments concerning alleged incompetence and corruption within UNRRA, including the alleged diverting of UNRRA resources to support of Zionist ambitions in Palestine. In 1951, Morgan became Controller of Atomic Energy, and was present for Operation Hurricane, the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in 1952. His position was abolished in 1954 with the creation of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority but he remained as Controller of Nuclear Weapons until 1956.\n\nQuestion: Who is Wang Xijie's father-in-law?": [

As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's, and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat.

Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat.

Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the \"common man\" against a \"corrupt aristocracy\" and to preserve the Union. Born in the colonial Carolinas to a Scotch-Irish family in the decade before the American Revolutionary War, Jackson became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. He served briefly in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as The Hermitage, and became a wealthy, slaveowning planter. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the Creek War of 1813\u20131814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson required the Creek surrender of vast lands in present-day Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory in 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans made him a national hero. Jackson then led U.S. forces in the First Seminole War, which led to the annexation of Florida from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in 1824, winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams in a contingent election. In reaction to the alleged \"corrupt bargain\" between Adams and Henry Clay and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the Democratic Party. Jackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide. Jackson faced the threat of secession by South Carolina over what opponents called the \"Tariff of Abominations. \" The crisis was defused when the tariff was amended, and Jackson threatened the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy struggle, Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party \"spoils system\" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly relocated most members of the Native American tribes in the South to Indian Territory. The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and disease. Jackson opposed the abolitionist movement, which grew stronger in his second term. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a \"most favored nation\" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the Napoleonic Wars, and recognized the Republic of Texas. In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president. In his retirement, Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk. Though fearful of its effects on the slavery debate, Jackson advocated the annexation of Texas, which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson has been widely revered in the United States as an advocate for democracy and the common man. Many of his actions proved divisive, garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country. His reputation has suffered since the 1970s, largely due to his role in Native American removal. Surveys of historians and scholars have ranked Jackson favorably among U.S. presidents.\nDocument[2](Title: Def Leppard) During the break following their 2015 tour, Def Leppard led the Hysteria on the High Seas concert cruise aboard the MSC Divina in January 2016.

She was discovered by LVN Pictures President Do\u00f1a Sisang de Leon, who insisted in casting her over the objections of the film's director, who felt she was too young for the part. It was the film's director, Carlos Vander Tolosa, who gave her the screen name \"Mila del Sol\" for \"causing the sun (sol) to appear as if by miracle (milagro) over his otherwise overcast set whenever she was called in to do her scenes.\" Film production shut down during the Japanese occupation and was restored only in 1945. Del Sol returned to LVN and starred in its production of Manuel Conde's \"Orasang Ginto\", the first post-war Filipino film. She starred in other LVN films of the 1940s, including \"Ibong Adarna\" (1949) and \"Villa Hermosa\". Del Sol retired from films to raise a family in the 1950s, but staged a comeback in 1960 with two films released that year, \"Pakipot\" and \"Tatlong Magdalena\". The following year, she starred in an international production, \"Espionage Far East, \"and later starred in a long-running television series. She began her career as an entrepreneur in 1964, and focused on philanthropic work from the 1970s onward.

Taft was elected president in 1908, the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt, but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice, a position in which he served until a month before his death. Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1857. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War. Taft attended Yale and, like his father, was a member of Skull and Bones. After becoming a lawyer, Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.\nWith Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November. In the White House, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party, with which Taft often sympathized, and the progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of re-election and he took only Utah and Vermont in Wilson's victory.

Zhou was China's head of government, serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976. Zhou served under Chairman Mao Zedong and was instrumental in the Communist Party's rise to power, and later in consolidating its control, forming foreign policy, and developing the Chinese economy. A skilled and able diplomat, Zhou served as the Chinese foreign minister from 1949 to 1958. Advocating peaceful coexistence with the West after the Korean War, he participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference and the 1955 Bandung Conference, and helped orchestrate Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. He helped devise policies regarding the bitter disputes with the United States, Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India and Vietnam. Zhou survived the purges of other top officials during the Cultural Revolution. While Mao dedicated most of his later years to political struggle and ideological work, Zhou was the main driving force behind the affairs of state during much of the Cultural Revolution. His attempts at mitigating the Red Guards' damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in the Cultural Revolution's later stages. As Mao's health began to decline in 1971 and 1972 and following the death of disgraced Lin Biao, Zhou was elected to the vacant position of First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party by the 10th Central Committee in 1973 and thereby designated as Mao's successor (the third person after Liu Shaoqi and Lin), but still struggled against the Gang of Four internally over leadership of China. His last major public appearance was at the first meeting of the 4th National People's Congress on 13 January 1975, where he presented the government work report. He then fell out of the public eye for medical treatment and died one year later. The massive public outpouring of grief in Beijing turned to anger at the Gang of Four, leading to the 1976 Tiananmen Incident. Although Zhou was succeeded by Hua Guofeng as First Vice Chairman and designated successor, Zhou's ally Deng Xiaoping was able to outmaneuver the Gang of Four politically and took Hua's place as paramount leader by 1978.\nDocument[2](Title: Valley of the Wolves: Palestine) Valley of the Wolves: Palestine is a 2011 Turkish action film directed by Z\u00fcbeyr \u015ea\u015fmaz and starring Necati \u015ea\u015fmaz, Nur Fettaho\u011flu and Erdal Be\u015fik\u00e7io\u011flu.

At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.\nDocument[3](Title: A Thief Has Arrived) A Thief Has Arrived may refer to:\nDocument[4](Title: Maya Kenig) Maya Kenig is an Israeli film director, writer and actress.

It is equipped to inflate and deflate itself as it runs. When submerged it seals its engine and runs with battery-electric thrusters, which are on a rotatable cross-arm, and is deflated. Thus it transforms between a fast light surface boat and a submerged diver propulsion vehicle. The central box contains the pump to deflate and inflate the tubes, and miscellaneous kit. The batteries, being heavy, are in a thick tube along its keel. Its outboard motor has a long snorkel so the Subskimmer can run on motor just submerged to try to avoid detection. Its thrusters are on a rotatable cross-arm which contains navigation kit. The Subskimmer project was started in the late 1970s by Submarine Products Ltd. of Hexham in Northumberland in England, the first boats being sold in their original form in 1983/84. There are 3 photographs of a working Subskimmer being demonstrated in Portsmouth, in the 15 September 1983 edition of the \"Daily Telegraph\" newspaper; the caption states its range as at underwater and at on the surface. Submarine Products Ltd also built an orange search and rescue version of Subskimmer called Seasearcher with high intensity submersible spotlights fitted. When Submarine Products Ltd closed down, Subskimmer (as at 1989) was made by Defence Boats Ltd, based in Hexham. At December 1992 it was being made (renamed Kraken 90) by Serrico, who were based at Saint-Georges-du-Vi\u00e8vre in Normandy in France.

During this time, the Earth's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events.\nDocument[3](Title: Ryan Hadlock) Ryan Hadlock is an American record producer, best known for his production work on platinum- selling album\" The Lumineers\" by The Lumineers.\nDocument[4](Title: Paris Sewer Museum) The Paris Sewer Museum, is a currently closed history museum located in the sewers at the esplanade Habib- Bourguiba, near the pont de l' Alma, in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, France.\nDocument[5](Title: Kungsg\u00e5rdssj\u00f6n (Dalarna)) Kungsg\u00e5rdssj\u00f6n is a lake located in the province of Dalarna, Sweden.

She wrote the song with Gaga and producer Nile Rodgers accompanied them during the recording, providing his suggestions. A universal song about any kind of loss in life,\" Til It Happens to You\" was placed during two sequences in the film, highlighting the pain of sexual assault.

Lewis Watson until 1806, was an English peer. His legal struggle with his former tutor over the occupation of the rectory of Kettering led to the case of \"Fletcher\" v. \"Lord Sondes\", in which the House of Lords declared that bonds of special resignation were simoniacal. After extensive litigation, he succeeded in instituting his younger brother in the rectory. The eldest son of Lewis Watson, 2nd Baron Sondes, and his wife Mary , he succeeded his father in the peerage in 1806. On 1 February 1810, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1814, Sondes presented his tutor, William Brice Fletcher, to the rectory of Kettering, of which he held the advowson. Fletcher entered into a bond with Sondes that he should resign the rectory when either of Sondes' younger brothers became capable of accepting a benefice. Sondes requested Fletcher's resignation in 1820 for the purpose of presenting his younger brother Henry; Fletcher, who had expected Sondes to find another benefice for him, refused, and Sondes successfully sued him for non-compliance. Fletcher appealed the verdict up to the House of Lords; in 1827, on judicial advice, they reversed the verdict and declared the bond to be simoniacal. Bonds of general resignation, where the appointee to a benefice bonded himself to resign whenever called upon by a patron to do so, had been held to be simoniacal in the case of \"Bishop of London\" v. \"Ffytche\". However, bonds of special resignation, like that signed by Fletcher, were thought to have been legal and were frequently used until \"Fletcher\" v. \"Lord Sondes\" was decided. Parliament subsequently passed legislation indemnifying existing bondholders and legalizing bonds of special resignation under certain regulated terms. As the presentation of Fletcher had been adjudged simoniacal, it was held to be void and the right to make the next presentation fell to the Crown; the King presented Henry Watson to the rectory. On 20 December 1830, Sondes was commissioned first major in the East Kent Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry. He was present to give homage in person at the coronation of William IV in 1831. He died unmarried in 1836 and was succeeded by his brother George. An obituarist recalled his dislike of sentiment and cant, and his aversion to women, employing manservants instead of housemaids at Rockingham Castle.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Charles Stuart, 1St Earl Of Lennox?": [

In 1964, he hit a home run 573 feet onto- and- over the left- field roof of Chicago's Comiskey Park. While playing in Chicago and because of his towering home runs, he was known by the nickname\" Big Nick\". Nicholson had an unusual batting style, holding the bat almost over his head as he'd look out at the pitcher from underneath his arms. During his 7- year career, he struck out 573 times in 1,419 at- bats, the worst strikeout rate in Major League history. In 1963, in 126 games and 449 at- bats, Nicholson struck out an American League- leading 175 times; this would remain a single- season franchise record until Adam Dunn struck out 177 times in 2011. On May 5, 1962, Nicholson was the last batter of a no-hitter pitched by Bo Belinsky of the Los Angeles Angels against the Baltimore Orioles, popping out to third base. The Orioles had signed Nicholson and loved his potential, having seen him hit .298 for their Aberdeen, South Dakota farm club in 1959 with 35 home runs. But the strikeouts accumulated, so in January 1963, Nicholson was traded to the White Sox along with Hoyt Wilhelm, Ron Hansen, Pete Ward for longtime All- Star shortstop Luis Aparicio and outfielder Al Smith. He enjoyed his best season in the majors, producing 103 hits with a career- high 22 home runs. But his league- leading 175 strikeouts kept his position with the team in jeopardy. One of the most memorable nights of the 1964 season occurred on May 6, during a doubleheader at Comiskey Park during which Nicholson demonstrated an amazing feat of strength. In Game 1, batting against Kansas City Athletics starter Moe Drabowsky in the fifth inning, Nicholson walloped a leadoff home run that either bounced atop the left- field roof or entirely cleared it. The ball was found across the street. Howie Roberts, the team's traveling secretary, told the Associated Press: \" If it had landed on the roof, it would have a visible bruise on it. It cleared the roof.\" The home run was officially measured at 573 feet and was discussed in years to come as one of baseball's longest of all time. Nicholson homered three times in that doubleheader, another off Drabowsky in the following inning, and a shot off Aurelio Monteagudo in the first inning of Game 2. Typically of his up- and- down fortunes, Nicholson would end up hitting just 13 home runs that entire 1964 season. For his career, he played in 538 Games and had 1,419 At Bats, 184 Runs, 301 Hits, 32 Doubles, 12 Triples, 61 Home Runs, 179 RBI, 6 Stolen Bases, 219 Walks, 0.212 Batting Average, 0.318 On- base percentage, 0.381 Slugging Percentage, 540 Total Bases, four Sacrifice Hits, 12 Sacrifice Flies, and seven Intentional Walks.\nDocument[6](Title: CMH Masjid Jhelum) CMH Mosque or DIV Headquarters Mosque or simply DIV Masjid is a Jamia mosque in Jhelum City, Punjab Province, Pakistan.

He was the youngest son of King Gustav I and his second wife, Margaret Leijonhufvud, brother of Eric XIV and John III, and uncle of Sigismund who was king of both Sweden and Poland. By his father's will he got, by way of appanage, the Duchy of S\u00f6dermanland, which included the provinces of N\u00e4rke and V\u00e4rmland; but he did not come into actual possession of them till after the fall of Eric and the succession to the throne of John in 1568. Both Charles and one of his predecessors, Eric XIV (1560\u201368), took their regnal numbers according to a fictitious history of Sweden. He was actually the third Swedish king called Charles. He came into the throne by championing the Protestant cause during the increasingly tense times of religious strife between competing sects of Christianity. In just over a decade, these would break out as the Thirty Years' War. These conflicts had already caused the dynastic squabble rooted in religious freedom that deposed his nephew and brought him to rule as king of Sweden. His reign marked the start of the final chapter (dated 1648 by some) of both the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. With his brother's death in November 1592, the throne of Sweden went to his nephew and Habsburg ally, Sigismund of Poland and Sweden. During these tense political times, Charles viewed the inheritance of the throne of Protestant Sweden by his devout Roman Catholic nephew with alarm. Thus, several years of religious controversy and discord followed. During the period, Charles and the Swedish privy council ruled in Sigismund's name while he stayed in Poland. After various preliminaries, the Riksdag of the Estates forced Sigismund to abdicate the throne to Charles IX in 1595. This eventually kicked off nearly seven decades of sporadic warfare as the two lines of the divided House of Vasa both continued to attempt to remake the union between the Polish and Swedish thrones with opposing counter-claims and dynastic wars. Quite likely, the dynastic outcome between Sweden and Poland's House of Vasa exacerbated and radicalized the later actions of Europe's Catholic princes in the German states such as the Edict of Restitution. In fact, it worsened European politics to the abandonment or prevention of settling events by diplomacy and compromise during the vast bloodletting that was the Thirty Years' war.\n\nQuestion: Which country the director of film Downloaded (Film) is from?": [

For the last twenty years of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer.

Born in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951.

Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones\".

In an interview appearing on indiewire.com, Pomes stated: \"The story began about people who I have been around, living outside of civilization, out in the woods, down a dirt road with all the old stereotypes: the roof caving in and the tires in the front yard. The story is about that group of people, and the family trying to be a family in the backwoods environment. Crystal meth was always out there. I was never at any crystal meth parties or anything like that, but there were always people where I lived outside of Houston. Those are the characters in the film, but crystal meth really drives the story. It's the vehicle.\" Not having direct contact with crystal meth addicts, Pomes read widely on the subject of drug addiction. Explained Pomes in an interview for \"Filmmaker MagazineI did a ton of research. Mostly just through the Internet, through magazine articles and things of that nature. I did a lot. There is so much out there. People on meth like to talk about it. They like to take about the process of making it, the problems they have with it.

They formed in California, United States, in 1992. The core members of the group are ambient musician Robert Rich and guitarist/ bassist Rick Davies. Rich and Davies have worked together since 1979. Davies had just returned to the United States after working with several experimental rock groups in the United Kingdom and Spain. During the next five years, Rich and Davies worked on several collaborative projects. The style of these projects was an aggressive blend of art rock and pure avant- garde composition. In 1983 Rich and Davies formed a trio with bassist Andrew McGowan called Urdu. Urdu performed several concerts in the San Francisco Bay Area. One of their last performances was a live radio broadcast in 1984. Some of their recorded material was released as a self- titled album on cassette in 1985. In 1992 the first version of Amoeba formed. It was a quartet featuring Robert Rich, Andrew McGowan, guitarist David Hahn and drummer Matt Isaacson. They released a five song EP- CD in 1993 titled\" Eye Catching\". This lineup dissolved soon after the release of\" Eye Catching\". In 1994 Rick Davies came to Rich with some of his new musical ideas. They were slow folk inspired pop compositions with strong ambient sensibilities. They decided to incorporate these ideas into a new version of Amoeba. This lineup featured Rich on vocals, synthesizers, percussion, lap steel guitar and flutes and Davies on guitars and bass. They developed a style consisting of slow, hypnotic and largely acoustic pop compositions and Rich \u2019s classic ambient textures and acoustic recordings. Their lyrics range from abstract to darkly emotional. This form of Amoeba has released two albums,\" Watchful\"( 1997) and\" Pivot\"( 2000). Each of these albums features a number of guest performers including cellist and multi-instrumentalist Hans Christian. After the release of\" Pivot\" Davies went on to pursue his solo career in Tucson, Arizona. Rich continues to release ambient solo albums and tour at a prolific rate.

He was born in Brignoles, into an artistic family that produced fourteen painters over six generations. His grandfather Georges Parrocel (1540- ca. 1614) (no surviving works) and his father Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1595\u20131660) were both painters. One badly restored painting of Bath\u00e9lemy survives in the church of Saint-Sauveur in Brignoles, France. His brothers Jean Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1631\u20131653) (no surviving works) and Louis Parrocel (1634\u20131694) also became painters. He was soon noticed He was only thirteen years old when his father died in 1660. His elder brother Louis, who was already established as a painter in the Languedoc, took him under his care and gave him a training as painter. Three years later he ran away from his brother's house to Marseilles. His talent as a painter became soon noticed and he got a commission for a number of paintings with scenes of the life of Saint Anthony of Padua for the church Saint-Martin. But he only executed two of them. it is also possible that he painted them during his second stay in the Provence. He left for Paris and stayed there for four years, perfecting his skills. He then returned to the Provence and continued his journey to Italy, where he would stay for eight years. In Rome he became the pupil of Jacques Courtois, a famous painter of battle scenes who was also known als \"le Bourguignon\" or \"il Borgognone\". He also studied the works of Salvator Rosa, an unorthodox proto-Romantic painter. Joseph Parrocel worked with him in his workshop and was thoroughly influenced by him, even if he gave his style later a more French touch. Parrocel then started a journey through Italy and finally arrived in Venice. He was planning to settle in this town but after eight brigands had attempted to murder him on the Rialto Bridge, he left Italy in disgust. He settled in Paris in 1675 and earned himself a reputation. He was accepted as an elected member at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 29 February 1676 and he became an academician on 14 November 1676 with his admission piece \"Siege of Maastricht\". In 1703 he became a councillor at the Academy. As a member of the Academy, he would obtain royal commissions. However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and the Palace of Versailles. During his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings. He died, aged 57, in Paris. He is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also landscapes, historical pieces and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the H\u00f4tel de Soubise and the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of the \"f\u00eates galantes\" of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes. His differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours. During his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University). Joseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690\u20131774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688\u20131752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667\u20131722) and Pierre (1670\u20131739), who both became painters and engravers.

Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the J\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. Simplified forms of certain characters are used in China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms (shinjitai), which are closer to traditional forms than Chinese simplifications, while uncommon characters are written in Japanese traditional forms (ky\u016bjitai), which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms. In South Korea, when Chinese characters are used they are of the traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Teaching of Chinese characters in South Korea starts in the 7th grade and continues until the 12th grade where 1,800 total characters are taught albeit these characters are only used in certain cases (on signs, academic papers, historical writings, etc.) and are slowly declining in use.\nDocument[2](Title: Liam Waite) Liam Waite( born Liam Owen East; March 20, 1971) is an American actor.

The main character, Alice, hypothesizes,\" Mad as a March hare\" is a common British English phrase, both now and in Carroll's time, and appears in John Heywood's collection of proverbs published in 1546. It is reported in\" The Annotated Alice\" by Martin Gardner that this proverb is based on popular belief about hares' behaviour at the beginning of the long breeding season, which lasts from February to September in Britain. Early in the season, unreceptive females often use their forelegs to repel overenthusiastic males. It used to be incorrectly believed that these bouts were between males fighting for breeding supremacy. Like the character's friend, the Hatter, the March Hare feels compelled to always behave as though it is tea- time because the Hatter supposedly\" murdered the time\" whilst singing for the Queen of Hearts. Sir John Tenniel's illustration also shows him with straw on his head, a common way to depict madness in Victorian times. The March Hare later appears at the trial for the Knave of Hearts, and for a final time as\" Haigha\"( which is pronounced to rhyme with\" mayor\", according to Carroll, and a homophone of\" hare\" in a non-rhotic accent), the personal messenger to the White King in\" Through the Looking- Glass\"( Alice either does not recognize him as the March Hare of her earlier dream, or chooses not to comment about this).\nDocument[6](Title: Samuel Washington Weis) Samuel Washington Weis (1870\u20131956) was an American cotton broker, painter and sketch artist.\n\nQuestion: Where did the director of film The Price Of Everything study?": [

Between 2007 and 2012, he served as a member of the Politburo and Communist Party Secretary of Chongqing, a major interior municipality. He was the son of Bo Yibo, one of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party of China , Bo Xilai is one of the \"princelings\" of Chinese politics. He cultivated a casual and charismatic image in a marked departure from Chinese political convention. In Chongqing, Bo initiated a campaign against organized crime, increased spending on welfare programs, maintained consistent double-digit percentage GDP growth, and campaigned to revive Cultural Revolution-era \"red culture\". Bo's promotion of egalitarian values and the achievements of his \"Chongqing model\" made him the champion of the Chinese New Left, composed of both Maoists and social democrats disillusioned with the country's market-based economic reforms and increasing economic inequality. However, the perceived lawlessness of Bo's anti-corruption campaigns, coupled with concerns about the image he cultivated, made him a controversial figure. Bo was considered a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012. His political fortunes came to an abrupt end following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu. Wang claimed to have information about the involvement of Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, who allegedly had close financial ties to the two. In the fallout, Bo was removed as the party chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. He was later stripped of all his positions and lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party. In 2013, Bo was found guilty of corruption, stripped of all his assets, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He is incarcerated at Qincheng Prison.\nDocument[6](Title: Jane Leslie Conly) Jane Leslie Conly (born 1948) is an American author, the daughter of author Robert C. O'Brien.

His role in the \"Gukurahundi\" massacres, in which thousands of Ndebele civilians were killed and which occurred during his tenure, is controversial. Mnangagwa was Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs from 1989 to 2000 and then served as Speaker of the Parliament from 2000 to 2005, when he was demoted to Minister of Rural Housing for openly jockeying to succeed the aging Mugabe. He returned to favour during the 2008 general election, in which he ran Mugabe's campaign, orchestrating political violence against the opposition Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai. Mnangagwa served as Minister of Defence from 2009 until 2013, when he became Minister of Justice again. He was also appointed First Vice-President in 2014 and was widely considered to be a leading candidate to succeed Mugabe. Mnangagwa's ascendancy was opposed by the President's wife, Grace Mugabe, and her Generation 40 faction. He was dismissed from his positions by Mugabe in November 2017, and fled to South Africa. Soon after, General Constantino Chiwenga, backed by elements of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and members of Mnangagwa's Lacoste political faction, launched a coup. After losing the support of ZANU\u2013PF, Mugabe resigned, and Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe to assume the presidency. He secured his first full term as President in the July 2018 election with 50.8% of the vote. Mnangagwa is nicknamed  or , which means \"the crocodile\" in the Shona language, initially because that was the name of the guerrilla group he founded, but later because of his political shrewdness. The faction within ZANU\u2013PF that supports him is called Lacoste after the French clothing company whose logo is a crocodile.\nDocument[6](Title: Michael Goode) Michael Goode( born 22 August 1952) is a British cross- country skier.

The concern with cord prolapse is that pressure on the cord from the baby will compromise blood flow to the baby. It usually occurs during labor but can occur anytime after the rupture of membranes. The greatest risk factors are an abnormal position of the baby within the uterus and a premature or small baby. Other risk factors include a multiple pregnancy, more than one previous delivery, and too much amniotic fluid. Whether medical rupture of the amniotic sac is a risk is controversial. The diagnosis should be suspected if there is a sudden decrease in the baby's heart rate during labor. Seeing or feeling the cord confirms the diagnosis. Management focuses on quick delivery, usually by cesarean section. Filling the bladder or pushing up the baby by hand is recommended until this can take place. Sometimes women will be placed in a knee- chest position or the Trendelenburg position in order to help prevent further cord compression. With appropriate management, the majority of cases have good outcomes. Umbilical cord prolapse occurs in about 1 in 500 pregnancies. The risk of death of the baby is about 10%. However, much of this risk is due to congenital anomalies or prematurity. It is considered an emergency.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Rocket Attack U.S.A. born?": [

Among his best-known work is \"The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's\". He was a regular and prolific contributor to \"The Boy's Own PaperB.O.P.\"), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: \"History of the Old English Letter Foundries\". Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a successful London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the \"B.O.P.\" was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing as a vehicle for moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre. In 1881, following the death of his father, Reed became head of the company. By then he had begun his monumental history which was published in 1887. Along with his \"B.O.P.\" contributions Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the \"Leeds Mercury\". He was a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the Bibliographical Society, and a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work as the definitive historian of English typefounding.\n\nQuestion: Who is Anna Of Nassau-Dillenburg (1541\u20131616)'s maternal grandmother?": [

Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia. The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company, but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it New South Wales. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788. Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.

The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000\u2013100,000 years.\nDocument[2](Title: To Paris with Love) To Paris with Love is a 1955 British comedy film directed by Robert Hamer and starring Alec Guinness, Odile Versois and Vernon Gray.\nDocument[3](Title: Hofmann voltameter) A Hofmann voltameter is often used as a demonstration of stoichiometric principles, as the two - to - one ratio of the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen gas produced by the apparatus illustrates the chemical formula of water, H O.

Built in World War I to help deliver reinforcements and supplies to the German troops on the Western Front, it connected Remagen on the west bank and the village of Erpel on the eastern side between two hills flanking the river.

In the 1960s, as members of the house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists including Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Sam& Dave, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Johnnie Taylor and Albert King.

While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660 ft, or 1 furlong) long and four perches (66 ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards, or 208 feet 9 inches (63.61 metres) on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560 square feet is an acre.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film A Man, A Woman, And A Bank?": [

A standalone sequel to\" Final Destination 2\"( 2003), it is the third installment in the\" Final Destination\" film series. Wong and Glen Morgan, who worked on the franchise's first film, wrote the screenplay. \" Final Destination 3\" stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, and takes place five years after the first film. Winstead plays Wendy Christensen, a high school graduate who has a premonition that a roller coaster she and her classmates are riding will derail. Although she saves some of them, Death begins hunting the survivors. Wendy realizes photographs she took at the amusement park contain clues about her classmates' death. Allies with another survivor and friend Kevin Fischer( Merriman), Wendy tries to use this knowledge to save the rest of them and to ruin Death's scheme. The film's development began shortly after the release of\" Final Destination 2\"; Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for the third one. Unlike the second film, which was a direct sequel to the first, the producers envisioned\" Final Destination 3\" as a stand- alone film. The idea of featuring a roller coaster derailment as the opening- scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan saw control as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005 and concluded in April. Like the previous two installments, it was filmed in Vancouver, Canada. The first two weeks of the three- month shoot were spent filming the roller coaster's derailment. Following its premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on February 2, 2006, the film was released in cinemas in the United States on February 10, 2006. The DVD, released on July 25, 2006, includes commentaries, documentaries, a deleted scene and an animated video. A special- edition DVD called\" Thrill Ride Edition\" includes a feature called\" Choose Their Fate\", which acts as an interactive film, allowing viewers to make decisions at specific points in the film that alter the course of the story. \" Final Destination 3\" received a mixed critical response. Some critics called the film formulaic and said it brought nothing new to the franchise, while others praised it for being enjoyable and fulfilling its audience's expectations. Two death scenes involving tanning beds and a nail gun, respectively, as well as Winstead's performance attracted positive comments from reviewers. The film was a financial success and, with box office receipts of nearly$ 118 million, the highest- grossing installment in the franchise at the time.

There have been several proposals of this nature from the mid-20th century onwards. During the French colonial era, a district of Montreal existed in the French Province of Canada. During the 19th century, Americans sometimes referred to the Province of Quebec as the Province of Montreal. The Roman Catholic church also divides Canada up into ecclesiastical provinces, one of which being the Ecclesiastical Province of Montreal. During the prelude to the Confederation of Canada in the 1860s, some proposals were made to divide up Lower Canada( the current province of Quebec) into multiple provinces, the one with the most currency being to create the provinces of Montreal, Eastern Townships and Quebec. One of the earlier modern proposals for the Province of Montreal dates from the late 1960s, when it was proposed that\" Mr. Montreal\", Mayor Jean Drapeau, having many successes, and having Montreal as the economic engine of the Province of Quebec, become the premier of a new province, due to the way that Montreal tax dollars were spent outside of the region, to little benefit to Montrealers. Following the renewed rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement in the 1990s, efforts revived to create a Province of Montreal. Roopnarine Singh of Montreal founded the Movement for the 11th Province of Montreal in this era. The era before and after the referendum of 1995 also produced proposals to split the western Ottawa Valley region, the Eastern Townships of Quebec along the US border, and English- speaking parts of Montreal( such as the West Island and Westmount) into a Province of Montreal. This proposal was made by the\" partitionist movement\", which demands the right for minorities to secede from Quebec if Quebec secedes from Canada. In the wake of the referendum, prominent lawyer and then- federalist Guy Bertrand led a court fight to allow for the creation of the Province of Montreal if Quebec were to secede. West Virginia was used as an example to support the position in public.\nDocument[4](Title: Borreby Castle) Borreby Castle is a fortified manor house located near Sk\u00e6lsk\u00f8r, Slagelse Municipality, in the south- west corner of the island of Zealand, in eastern Denmark.\nDocument[5](Title: Mount Frakes) Mount Frakes is a prominent shield volcano marking the highest elevation in the Crary Mountains, in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica and is the third highest volcanic elevation on the continent.\nDocument[6](Title: Grimoald the Elder) Grimoald I( 616\u2013657), called the Elder( in French,\" Grimaud l' Ain\u00e9\"), was the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia from 640 to 656.

This finding took six years for Ziak to piece together, using the comments in the expedition's journals to find the locations the explorers stopped at on their trip. A controversy arose between Oregon, long considered the end of the expedition, and Washington's historians over Ziak's findings, with many historians in Washington and elsewhere supporting his discovery and many in Oregon opposing it. In 1999, soon after his announcement, Ziak and David Nicandri, director of the Washington State Historical Society, began petitioning to give the newly found ending location, a camping spot called Station Camp, National Landmark Status. In addition, that year, US Representative Brian Baird had an amendment passed that changed the\" federal designation of the Lewis and CLark National Historic Trail as ending not in Oregon but in Oregon and Washington.\" In 2004, Ziak testified before Congress in support of the Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks.

The urokotori is pulled across the skin of the fish from the tail to the head repeatedly to remove the scales.\nDocument[2](Title: Darling, How Could You!)

Modeled after psychedelic pop groups from the 1960s, the Dukes were initially publicised by Virgin Records as a mysterious new act, but were actually an XTC spin- off band. They recorded only two albums:\" 25 O' Clock\"( 1985) and\" Psonic Psunspot\"( 1987). In the UK, the records outsold XTC's then- current albums\" The Big Express\"( 1984) and\" Skylarking\"( 1986). Partridge envisioned the Dukes as an amalgamation of\" your favourite bands from 1967.\" He and Dave Gregory conceived the project in 1979, but it was not until December 1984 that the band found the opportunity to spend a few days recording what would become\" 25 O' Clock\". Three rules were set for its production: songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia, no more than two takes allowed, and use vintage equipment wherever possible. After reuniting for the LP\" Psonic Psunspot\", XTC told interviewers that the group were killed in a\" horrible sherbet accident\". Several sequels were proposed but ultimately abandoned, including the mock rock opera\" The Great Royal Jelly Scandal\", a prequel album featuring the Dukes in their early Merseybeat phase, and a glitter rock parody as\" The Stratosphear Gang\". In 1993, Partridge conceived a spiritual successor to the Dukes in the form of a\" heavily sexual\" bubblegum LP. Virgin rejected the album, leading XTC to go on strike against the label for several years. Some of its songs were later reworked and released on subsequent XTC albums and compilations. The Dukes of Stratosphear anticipated and were celebrated by retro-minded movements such as the Paisley Underground. In 2003, they reunited again to record one song commissioned by the MS Society, and in 2008, Partridge recorded two tracks credited to\" the Dukes\" as part of a commission for Eurostar. These songs were included as bonuses on later reissues of the Dukes albums.\nDocument[5](Title: Gu Hengbo) Gu Mei( 1619 \u2013 1664), better known by her art name Gu Hengbo, also known as Xu Mei and Xu Zhizhu after her marriage, was a Chinese courtesan, poet and painter.

Cellach was the son of M\u00e1el Coba mac \u00c1edo( died 615) and belonged to the Cen\u00e9l Conaill branch of the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. According to the Irish annals derived from the\" Chronicle of Ireland\", he may have been High King, jointly with his brother Conall C\u00f3el, following the death of his uncle Domnall mac \u00c1edo in 642. The\" Annals of Ulster\" for 643 say: Here there is doubt as to who reigned after Domnall. Some historiographers say that four kings, namely Cellach and Conall C\u00f3el and the two sons of \u00c1ed Sl\u00e1ine, namely Diarmait and Blathmac, ruled in shared reigns. All four putative successors to Domnall had been his allies at the great Battle of Mag Roth in 637, where Congal C\u00e1ech was defeated at the authority of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill re-established, and it is not implausible that all four ruled together. He ruled from 643- 654 The king lists give Cellach and Conall as reigning before Diarmait and Blathmac. Both Cellach and Conall are omitted from the earliest king list- a late 7th century poem\" Baile Chuinn\". A challenge to their authority occurred in the north when their cousin \u00d3engus mac Domnaill was defeated and killed at the Battle of D\u00fan Cremthainn by Conall and Cellach in 650. Conall C\u00f3el was killed by Diarmait in 654 while Cellach died in 658, perhaps at Bru na B\u00f3inne. It is possible Cellach had been captured by Diarmait in 654 and died a prisoner.

He was named after his father's maternal grandfather, the Emperor Henry IV, and his mother's father, Count Berengar II of Sulzbach. He was groomed for the succession, but predeceased his father. In 1139, Henry was betrothed to Sophia, daughter of King B\u00e9la II of Hungary. She moved to Germany to learn German language and court culture, but relations between Germany and Hungary cooled after the death of her father in 1141. The marriage was cancelled while Sophia was still residing in Germany. After several letters to her brother, King G\u00e9za II, she received permission to remain in the German monastery where she had been living. Conrad and Henry likewise approved. Conrad had the princes elect Henry, then ten years old, as co-King of Germany at a diet in Regensburg on 13 March 1147, before Conrad left on the Second Crusade. Henry was anointed and crowned on Laetare Sunday (30 March) in Aachen. During his father's absence on crusade (June 1147\u2013May 1149), he was placed under the tutorship of the powerful abbot Wibald and the notary Heinrich von Wiesenbach. For his services, Heinrich was raised to the rank of master (\"magister\") or protonotary (\"protonotarius\"). Nine letters (eight in full) written by or for Henry survive from this period of his reign. The young Henry was the winning general at the Battle of Flochberg (1150) against Welf VI and Welf VII. The military prowess of the young ruler was emphasised in letters (dated the week of 16\u201320 April 1150 at W\u00fcrzburg) to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I and the empress Irene, Gertrude's sister, informing them of the victory.

Prior to the construction the land housed a Cedar Lodge. The construction created a small island in the creek that then housed the Cedar Lodge, but this structure was demolished in the 1930s. The Creek originally ran from near Lyon Street all the way to the canal. The creek was named after George Patterson, an early settler who owned the lot where the creek emptied into the canal. In the 1890s work began on landscaping the area. The western portion of the creek disappeared, replaced by Central Park in one of the first projects of the Ottawa Improvement Commission. Today Patterson Creek runs for two blocks from the canal to just west of O'Connor Street. The creek is located in the northern part of the Glebe neighbourhood, just to the south of the Queensway and Centretown. The creek, and the landscaped park that surrounds it, are surrounded by large houses which are some of the most expensive in Ottawa. First Avenue Public School also looks out upon the creek. The creek is crossed by two bridges one at O'Connor and the other at the Queen Elizabeth Driveway. During the winter the creek is cleared and used as a skating rink, along with the rest of the canal.

Bisgood was a right-handed middle-order batsman and occasional wicketkeeper. He made a sensational debut for Somerset in 1907, being picked for the match against Worcestershire at Worcester when the Somerset captain, Lionel Palairet, was struggling to find enough players to make up a side.

Bisgood was the first Somerset cricketer to score a century on debut; the second would be Harold Gimblett in 1935.

From 1239 until his death, he was the ruling Lord of Conches- en- Ouche and Mehun- sur- Y\u00e8vre. He was the eldest of five sons of Robert of Courtenay, Lord of Champignelles( \u2020 1239), and his wife Matilda of Mehun. From his parents he inherited the castle of Conches and Mehun. On 25 August 1248, he sailed with his cousin, King Louis IX of France, from Aigues- Mortes to Egypt to fight the Seventh Crusade, during which he died. Most historians think he died during the battle for the city of Al Mansurah on 8 February 1250. On that day, Count Robert I of Artois led a vanguard of Crusaders in a spontaneous attack on the city. The vanguard was caught in a trap set by the defending Mamluks and all attackers were killed. However, the chronicler Jean de Joinville maintains Peter of Courtenay died on an earlier date. After the conquest of the Egytion port city of Damietta in June 1249, a large part of the crusader army camped outside the city wall, until they were ready to march to Al Mansurah in the autumn. The Sultan of Egypt offered a reward of one gold solidus for the head of each crusader. During the night, Saracens would sneak into the Crusader camp, kill sleeping Crusaders in their tents, and steal their severed heads. According to Joinville, Peter of Courtenay was the victim of one such attack. However, Joinville may be mistaken. One should consider that he wrote his chronicle decades after the fact, and that Peter de Courtenay is mentioned twice later in the chronicle, in connection with the Battle of Al Mansurah.\nDocument[5](Title: Last Man Standing (American TV series)) Amanda Fuller (seasons 2 -- present) and Alexandra Krosney (season 1) as Kristin Beth Baxter, the oldest daughter: Kristin, unlike her father, espouses liberal political views and her views with regard to Christianity seem ambiguous.

The frequency of dark - coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced, the light - coloured form again predominated. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth was an early test of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action, and remains as a classic example in the teaching of evolution. Sewall Wright described it as ``the clearest case in which a conspicuous evolutionary process has actually been observed.

Morgan) Ephraim Franklin Morgan (January 16, 1869January 15, 1950) was born on a farm near Forksburg, Marion County, West Virginia, a descendant of the first white settler of western Virginia, Morgan Morgan, and his son David Morgan. He studied at Fairmont State Normal School and graduated from the West Virginia University law school in 1897. After establishing a law practice in Fairmont, Morgan enlisted in the First West Virginia Infantry during the Spanish\u2013American War. Following the war, he became the Fairmont city attorney. He served as a judge of the Marion County Intermediate Court from 1907 to 1912 and as a member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission from 1915 to 1920. In 1902, he married Alma Bennett. At the time Morgan became governor, a virtual state of war existed between union coal miners and coal operators. The United Mine Workers union was protesting for the right to organize miners in the southwestern part of the state. In late summer 1921, the governor called upon President Warren G. Harding to dispatch federal troops to end an armed miners' march in Boone and Logan counties. After the conflict ended, Morgan used National Guard troops to discourage miners from again taking up arms. A more detailed discussion of the 1921 armed miners' march and the Battle of Blair Mountain can be found in Clayton D. Laurie's \"The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920\u20131921\" in \"West Virginia History\", Volume 50 (1991). Under Morgan, the legislature created a sinking fund to provide financial assistance to new programs, namely a new road system. He appointed a Capitol Commission to devise a plan for replacing the old state capitol, which was destroyed by fire on January 3, 1921. The west wing of the present state capitol was completed in 1925. One week before leaving office, Ephraim and Alma Morgan became the first residents of the present West Virginia Governor's Mansion. After his term as governor, Morgan served as solicitor for the United States Department of Commerce before retiring in Fairmont, West Virginia. In 1940, he was defeated for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. He died in Bethesda, Maryland, on January 15, 1950, one day before his 81st birthday.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mother-in-law of Maria Caroline Gibert De Lametz?": [

Another theory holds that the island found by da Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, 2,430 kilometres (1,510 mi) to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships attached to the squadron of Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama expedition on 30 July 1503 (as reported in the account of clerk Thom\u00e9 Lopes). However, a paper published in 2015 reviewed the discovery date and dismissed the 18 August as too late for da Nova to make a discovery and then return to Lisbon by 11 September 1502, whether he sailed from St Helena or Tristan da Cunha. It demonstrates the 21 May is probably a Protestant rather than Catholic or Orthodox feast-day, first quoted in 1596 by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, who was probably mistaken because the island was discovered several decades before the Reformation and start of Protestantism. The alternative discovery date of 3 May, the Catholic feast-day for the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, quoted by Odoardo Duarte Lopes and Sir Thomas Herbert is suggested as being historically more credible.\nDocument[2](Title: Go Quiet) Go Quiet is a music film directed by Dean DeBlois, featuring acoustic renditions of all nine songs from the 2010 album \"Go\" by J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r (J\u00f3nsi) Birgisson.

Dean DeBlois, who also directed 2007's \"Heima\" for Sigur R\u00f3s, had this to say of the film's intent: \"The concept behind \u2018Go Quiet\u2019 was simple: it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day in Reykjav\u00edk, and J\u00f3nsi awakens to a trashed house in the wake of his party.

Ibrahim was originally a Christian from Parga (in Epirus), who was captured in a raid during the 1499\u20131503 Ottoman-Venetian War, and was given as a slave to Suleiman most likely in 1514. Suleiman made him the royal falconer, then promoted him to first officer of the Royal Bedchamber. Ibrahim Pasha rose to Grand Vizier in 1523 and commander-in-chief of all the armies. Suleiman also conferred upon Ibrahim Pasha the honor of beylerbey of Rumelia (first-ranking military governor-general), granting Ibrahim authority over all Ottoman territories in Europe, as well as command of troops residing within them in times of war. According to a 17th-century chronicler, Ibrahim had asked Suleiman not to promote him to such high positions, fearing for his safety; to which Suleiman replied that under his reign, no matter what the circumstance, Ibrahim would never be put to death.Yet Ibrahim eventually fell from grace with the Sultan. During his thirteen years as Grand Vizier, his rapid rise to power and vast accumulation of wealth had made Ibrahim many enemies at the Sultan's court. Reports had reached the Sultan of Ibrahim's impudence during a campaign against the Persian Safavid empire: in particular his adoption of the title serasker sultan (\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646) was seen as a grave affront to Suleiman.Suleiman's suspicion of Ibrahim was worsened by a quarrel between the latter and the finance secretary (defterdar) Iskender \u00c7elebi. The dispute ended in the disgrace of \u00c7elebi on charges of intrigue, with Ibrahim convincing Suleiman to sentence the defterdar to death. Before his death however, \u00c7elebi's last words were to accuse Ibrahim of conspiracy against the Sultan. These dying words convinced Suleiman of Ibrahim's disloyalty, and on 15 March 1536 Ibrahim was executed.\nDocument[3](Title: Dindigul Sarathy) Dindigul Sarathy is a 2008 Indian Tamil language drama film directed by Siva Sanmukam, who earlier directed \"Thagapansamy\".

Born to Wenman Coke, Member of Parliament (MP) for Derby, and his wife Elizabeth, Coke was educated at several schools, including Eton College, before undertaking a Grand Tour of Europe. After returning to Britain and being married, Coke's father died, leaving him the owner of a 30,000 acre Norfolk estate. Returned to Parliament in 1776 for Norfolk, Coke became a close friend of Charles James Fox, and joined his Eton schoolmate William Windham in his support of the American colonists during the American Revolutionary War. As a supporter of Fox, Coke was one of the MPs who lost their seats in the 1784 general election, and he returned to Norfolk to work on farming, hunting, and the maintenance and expansion of Holkham Hall, his ancestral home. Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1790, sitting continuously until 1832, and he primarily spoke on matters of local interest, such as the Corn Laws. His second focus was on civil liberties, and he spoke out against the government's response to the Peterloo Massacre and similar events. Described as the \"greatest commoner in England\", he chose the passage of the Great Reform Act 1832 as the moment to retire, later being made the Earl of Leicester in July 1837. After a short illness, Coke died on 30 June 1842, and was succeeded as Earl by his son Thomas. Coke's main legacy is as an agricultural reformer, not as a politician; he has historically been credited with sparking the British Agricultural Revolution through the reforms he made to farming on his estates.

Paul's parents were Bernadette Boulet Bouchard and Alfred Bouchard. He studied at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec from 1920 to 28. A family friend, Philippe-Auguste Choquette, secured Paul a special pass to the Library of Parliament, where he attended lectures as a young man. In 1934, he opened a law firm with Roger V\u00e9zina. As editor of the journal \"La Nation\" (The Nation), he criticized the government of R.B. Bennett and argued that Canadian Confederation was bankrupt. As well as a Quebec Nationalist, Bouchard was a militant corporatist tempted by antisemitism. He was inspired by Mussolini's use of the fasces (a symbol of fascism), and created a small, militant extreme-right group called the Republican Fasces (or Separatist Fasces) associated with \"La Nation\". Bouchard supported a secular form of Quebec nationalism, opposed to the clerico-nationalist movement represented by Lionel-Groulx. In 1940s, Bouchard supported the government of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis. He was one of the main journalists and propagandists of Duplessis' Union nationale political party, and the author of many official party publications.

In 1980, he became the president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9crivains Canadiens (Society of French-Canadian Authors).

The film primarily examines Cyril( Philip Davis) and Shirley( Ruth Sheen), a motor- cycle courier and his girlfriend, along with their friends, neighbours, and Cyril's mother and sister. Despite staying true to Leigh's down- at- the- heel, realist style, the film is ultimately a social comedy concerning culture clashes between different classes and belief systems. According to the critic Michael Coveney',\" As in\" Meantime High Hopes\" contrasts the economic and spiritual conditions of siblings. And in developing some of the themes in\" Babies Grow Old\" and\" Grown- Ups\", it presents a brilliantly organised dramatic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of attitudes towards parturition and old age.\"\nDocument[2](Title: William Kassebaum) William\" Bill\" Kassebaum( born February 11, 1962) is an American Republican politician, lawyer, and rancher.\nDocument[3](Title: La vida es un sue\u00f1o) La vida es un sue\u00f1o is the third soundtrack album of the Argentine telenovela\" Soy Luna\", titled\" Soy Luna: La vida es un sue\u00f1o Life is a Dream\") was scheduled to be released on March 3, 2017.

She founded the women's section of the Tudeh( communist) party of Iran. She received a liberal education for the Iranian women of her time, and attended university later in life while living in exile. She was a linguist, fluent in Kurdish, Persian, Arabic, French, Russian, German, and English. An independent thinker, she appreciated communist theory. Later in life she said that the reason she chose to become a member of the Tudeh party was that when she decided to actively engage in the women's rights movement, the only party who was willing to accept her[ as a woman] and give her a chance to do something at that time was the Tudeh Party. Maryam chose to use the surname Firouz in her political struggles; her grandfather's name. She became known as Maryam Firouz in the political arena. She retained her legal name as Maryam Farman Farmaian with pride. She first married General army Abbassgholi Esfandiary[ son of Mohtashem Saltaneh] in a marriage arranged by her father. They had two daughters, Afsaneh and Afsar. They divorced on the death of her father. In 1949 Maryam married Noureddin Kianouri, a member and later general secretary of the Tudeh Party of Iran. In cooperation with Noureddin Kianouri, Farman Farmaian established a women's division of the Tudeh Party. Following the attempted assassination of Mohammad Reza Shah on 4 February 1949, the Tudeh party was blamed and her husband was imputed to have been one of the masterminds of the operation. She and her husband were forced into exile in 1956. She started her life in exile in the USSR and then lived in East Berlin, in the former German Democratic Republic. During her years of exile she completed her university studies and later taught French in the universities of Leipzig and Berlin. The couple returned to Iran following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the deposition of the Shah. The Tudeh party was reinstituted with Noureddin Kianouri as General Secretary. In 1983, the Tudeh Party was again banned following accusations of espionage for the Soviet Union. Noureddin Kianouri and Farman Farmaian were imprisoned. Maryam Firouz spent all of her imprisonment in solitary confinement. She was the only member of the Tudeh Party's imprisoned leadership who did not make a forced confession on TV at the time. She was released from prison in 1994 and placed under house arrest for a couple more years before being released to the custody of her eldest daughter in Tehran. After his release in the mid 90's, Kianouri wrote an open letter detailing the torture of himself and his wife while in prison. Dr. Noureddin Kianouri died on 5 November 1999.

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\nDocument[5](Title: English Striptease) English Striptease (Spanish: Strip-tease a la inglesa) is a 1975 Spanish comedy film directed by Jos\u00e9 Luis Madrid and starring Carmen Sevilla, Teresa Gimpera and \u00c1gata Lys.\nDocument[6](Title: Color Me Dead) Color Me Dead is a 1969 Australian thriller directed by Eddie Davis, starring American actors Tom Tryon and Carolyn Jones.

Although the number of residents born in Africa is very small, it has tripled between 2000 and 2010 (this group also includes non-blacks). The majority of blacks in Bermuda can be termed \"Bermudian blacks\", whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th century and the end of slavery in 1834, Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion. This contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies, who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate, and slaveholders in the United States and the West Indies found it necessary to continue importing more enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same had been true for the Native Americans that the Africans had replaced on the New World plantations). The indigenous populations of many West Indian islands, and much of the South-East of what is now the United States that had survived the 16th- and 17th-century epidemics of European-introduced diseases then became the victims of large-scale slave raiding, with much of the region completely depopulated. When the supply of indigenous slaves ran out, the slaveholders looked to Africa). The ancestry of Bermuda's black population is distinguished from that of the British West Indian black population in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of European and Native American admixture; secondly, the source of the African ancestry.\nDocument[6](Title: William Davies (palaeontologist)) William Davies,( 13 July 1814 \u2013 13 February 1891) was a British palaeontologist.\n\nQuestion: Are the movies Blood: The Last Vampire (2009 Film) and Jamesy Boy, from the same country?": [

He was the sixth American vice president to die in office. Hobart was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore, and grew up in nearby Marlboro. After attending Rutgers College, Hobart read law with prominent Paterson attorney Socrates Tuttle. The two studied together, and Hobart married Tuttle's daughter Jennie. Although he rarely set foot in a courtroom, Hobart became wealthy as a corporate lawyer. Hobart served in local governmental positions, and then successfully ran for office as a Republican, serving in both the New Jersey General Assembly and the New Jersey Senate. He became Speaker of the first, and president of the latter. Hobart was a longtime party official, and New Jersey delegates went to the 1896 Republican National Convention determined to nominate the popular lawyer for vice president. Hobart's political views were similar to those of McKinley, who was the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. With New Jersey, a key state in the upcoming election, McKinley and his close adviser, future senator Mark Hanna, decided to have the convention select Hobart. The vice-presidential candidate emulated his running mate with a front porch campaign, though spending much time at the campaign's New York City office. McKinley and Hobart were elected. As vice president, Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley. Hobart's tact and good humor were valuable to the President, as in mid-1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office. Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home and broke the news to the secretary, who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington. Hobart died on November 21, 1899 of heart disease at age 55; his place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt.\nDocument[2](Title: Blonde Savage) Blonde Savage is a 1947 American adventure film directed by Steve Sekely and written by Gordon Bache.

It stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan and Lauren Bacall; it also features Dolores Moran, Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard, Dan Seymour, and Marcel Dalio. The plot centers on the romance between a freelancing fisherman in Martinique and a beautiful American drifter, which is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France. Ernest Hemingway and Howard Hawks were close friends and, on a fishing trip, Hawks told Hemingway, who was reluctant to go into screenwriting, that Hemingway could make a great movie from his worst book, which Hawks admitted was\" To Have and Have Not\". Jules Furthman wrote the first screenplay, which was set in Cuba like the novel. However, the screenplay was altered to be set in Martinique instead of Cuba because the portrayal of Cuba's government was believed to be in violation of the United States' Good Neighbor policy with Latin American countries. Hawks's other good friend, William Faulkner, was the main contributor to the screenplay, including and following the revisions. Because of the contributions from both Hemingway and Faulkner, the film represents the only film story on which two winners of the Nobel Prize of Literature worked. Filming began on February 29, 1944, while Faulkner continued to work on the script, and ended on May 10. The film released nationally on October 11, 1944. Audience reception of the film was generally good. Reviews were mixed, with many claiming that the film was a remake of\" Casablanca\"( 1942). Critics specifically mentioned Lauren Bacall's performance or the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall on screen. Bogart and Bacall began an off- screen relationship during production and married in 1945, after the film's release. \" To Have and Have Not\" was one of the top thirty grossing films in 1944 and it received an award from the National Board of Review.\nDocument[4](Title: Rowley James) Rowland \"Rowley\" James (14 June 1885 \u2013 4 July 1962) was an Australian politician and coalminer. Born at Lambton, New South Wales, the son of a Welshman (Moses James), he was educated at a government school and worked in the mines for twenty-five years (including a five-year stint in Western Australia). On 24 July 1912, he married Gladys Mary Davies. Having served the Collie River District Miners' Union of Workers, he returned to New South Wales to become part of the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation. James was elected to the Australian House of Representatives for the Australian Labor Party in 1928, succeeding former Labor leader Matthew Charlton in the seat of Hunter. He was a critic of both the conservative government of Stanley Bruce and the Labor government of James Scullin for not prosecuting mine-owners during the protracted miner lock-out in northern New South Wales (1929\u201330), which led to accusations of inciting mob violence; \"Smith's Weekly\" published his record of convictions, including drunkenness and assaulting police. A supporter of Jack Lang's proposal that New South Wales should not repay interest to British bond-holders in the height of the Great Depression , James joined Jack Beasley's Lang Labor Party, along with six other New South Wales MPs, who voted in opposition to defeat the Scullin government. At the ensuing elections, both Labor parties lost heavily but James easily retained his seat. Re-admitted to the ALP in 1936, James was chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on public works from 1943, and led the Australian delegation to the first International Labour Organization coal-mining committee in London in 1945. He continued to be prominent in coal-mining affairs, and his support for Prime Minister Ben Chifley's stand on the 1949 coal strike prompted some to express a desire to expel him from the Miners' Federation. A man who disliked convention, James was succeeded in the seat of Hunter in 1958 by ALP leader H. V. Evatt, who was in turn succeeded by James' son Bert. James died on 4 July 1962 in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, and was survived by his wife, daughter and three of his five sons.\nDocument[5](Title: Daughter of Julius Constantius) An unnamed daughter of Julius Constantius was the first known wife of Constantius II.\nDocument[6](Title: United States v.

The salmon runs up to the\" Slettafossen\", a high combination of waterfalls and rapids more than upriver from the estuary. The Rauma River and its valley are regarded as one of the most beautiful in Norway. The river runs very clear with a green tint and the mountains tower some above the river in the lower and middle parts of the valley. The Reinheimen National Park and the Trollveggen cliff are both located along the southwestern shores of the river through the municipality of Rauma.

He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism. An innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. Additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers. In 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce \"the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logicianWebster's Biographical Dictionary\" said in 1943 that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time\". Keith Devlin similarly referred to Peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever.\nDocument[5](Title: Shiva Parvathi) Shiva Parvathi( Kannada: \u0cb6\u0cbf\u0cb5 \u0caa\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0ca4\u0cbf) is a 1950 Indian Kannada film, directed by T.

He was a specialist in the history of the modern architecture of Finland. He was the first person to write critical monographs in any language on three individual Finnish modernist architects, Alvar Aalto \u2013\" Alvar Aalto: A Critical Study\"( 1983) \u2013 Reima Pietil\u00e4 \u2013\" Reima Pietil\u00e4: Architecture, Context, Modernism\"( 1985) \u2013 and Juha Leivisk\u00e4 \u2013\" Juha Leiviska and the Continuity of Finnish Modern Architecture\"( 2001).

He is best remembered for several horror films: \"Frankenstein\" (1931), \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical \"Show Boat\". He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, and many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. Whale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play \"Journey's End\" led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from \"Journey's End\" (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera. At the height of his career as a director Whale directed \"The Road Back\" (1937), a sequel to \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool. Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career.\nDocument[5](Title: The Monk and the Demon) The Monk and the Demon is a 2016 Russian comedy film directed by Nikolay Dostal.

The film is an early example of the plot premise which would prove very popular in the British silent film canon: that of a character (almost always a pretty young girl) from the working-class East End of London being suddenly thrust by circumstance into the daunting milieu of West End high society. The full print of \"East Is East\" survives, and is well regarded by historians of British silent film. Writing for the British Film Institute, Bryony Dixon notes: \"Edwards seems to have had an innate or instinctive understanding of cinema space both as an actor and director, and despite being hampered as everyone else at that early date by rather fixed sets and camera positions, he uses himself and the other actors to convey the space beyond the fourth wall, creating the illusion of a satisfyingly convincing world.\" She also notes: \"The locations are well chosen and evocative of a bygone era, particularly the lovely scenes in the Kentish hop fields\", and that Edith Evans in a very early screen role \"outrageously upstages everyone at every opportunity\". Although largely a serious drama, the film also includes scenes of visual humour arising from the awkward collision of East End and West End manners and habits.\nDocument[5](Title: Mae (Riz Ortolani song)) \"Mae\" is a 1965 song written by Riz Ortolani for the MGM motion picture \"The Yellow Rolls-Royce\"; the song is the theme for the section of the film in which ownership of the titular Rolls-Royce passes to a gangster and becomes the backdrop to a dangerous romance between the gangster's girlfriend Mae Jenkins (Shirley MacLaine) and a young Italian named Stefano (Alain Delon).

Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 \u00b0C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.\nDocument[4](Title: Audrey Rose (novel)) Audrey Rose is a novel written by Frank De Felitta, published in 1975. about a couple confronted with the idea that their young daughter might be the reincarnation of another man's child.

His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family. In 1921, when Dzhugashvili had reached the age of fourteen, he was brought to Moscow, where his father had become a leading figure in the Bolshevik government who eventually became head of the Soviet Union.

Married twice, Dzhugashvili had three children, two who reached adulthood.

The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the Deutsches Reich was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries -- both left - and right - wing), as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Weimar Germany fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.\nDocument[5](Title: Kalateh-ye Hajji) Kalateh- ye Hajji may refer to:\nDocument[6](Title: Miquette Giraudy) Miquette Giraudy (born 9 February 1953, Nice, France) is a keyboard player and vocalist, best known for her work in Gong and with her partner Steve Hillage.

It was sung by Stanley Holloway as Alfred P. Doolittle in both the original stage and film versions. It is sung by Eliza's bin man father, Alfred P. Doolittle and is about a list of everyday situations which one finds themselves in, and a desire to take the easy way out as \"With a Little Bit of Luck\" one's fate might change, thus avoiding any responsibility. The song is traditionally sung in a deep Cockney accent. The song occurs twice at Act 1 in the musicals. Both \"With a Little Bit of Luck\" scenes are at the same tenement in Tottenham Court Road, London in 1912. Firstly, Alfred P. Doolittle sings along with bin men Harry and Jamie who are his drinking companions after the scene Eliza's \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\" and secondly (\"reprise\"), three days later, with new verses to hear of Eliza he sings along with all the common people there (ensemble) after Prof. Higgins' \"I'm an Ordinary Man\". However in the Holloway's film version in 1964, this song occurred only after \"I'm an Ordinary Man\" and some verses were omitted. When Alfred P. Doolittle sang the other of his two songs \"Get Me to the Church on Time\" (Act 2), he was not an impoverished workingman but rich middle-class owing to Higgins' recommendation to an American millionaire, although Doolittle was a man who didn't want \"middle-class morality\". Clearly, \"With a Little Bit of Luck\" and \"Get Me to the Church on Time\" are related and similar to each other as music hall-style songs.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released first, Koko And The Ghosts or Cheppave Chirugali?": [

Tom Grunfeld says that Tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the Ming court, while Rossabi adds that Tsongkhapa cited the \"length and arduousness of the journey\" to China as another reason not to make an appearance. This first request by the Ming was made in 1407, but the Ming court sent another embassy in 1413, this one led by the eunuch Hou Xian (\u5019\u986f; fl. 1403\u20131427), which was again refused by Tsongkhapa. Rossabi writes that Tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the Ming court, so he sent his disciple Chosrje Sh\u0101kya Yeshes to Nanjing in 1414 on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon him the title of \"State Teacher\"\u2014the same title earlier awarded the Phagmodrupa ruler of Tibet.

Other regions of Company controlled India -- Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency -- remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support.

He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.

His major writings include\" Two Dogmas of Empiricism\"( 1951), which attacked the traditional analytic- synthetic distinction between propositions and advocated a form of semantic holism, and\" Word and Object\"( 1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning. He also developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide\" an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input.\" He is also important in philosophy of science for his\" systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself\" and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science.

R. Subba Rao's three novels\" NagarahavuOndu Gandu Eradu Hennu\" and\" Sarpa Mathsara\", and starring Vishnuvardhan, Aarathi, K. S. Ashwath and Shubha in lead roles. The supporting cast features Leelavathi, Ambareesh, Shivaram, Dheerendra Gopal, Lokanath and Vajramuni. This is the first Kannada movie to complete 100 days in three centres. This film was remade in Hindi as\" Zehreela Insaan\", directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself and in Tamil as\" Raja Nagam\" and\" Kode Nagu\" in Telugu. The film was a huge success and paved way for the stardom of Vishnuvardhan and Ambarish who eventually morphed as leading actors in Kannada cinema. This was Vishnuvardhan's first movie as the lead. Over a period of time, the character roles of Leelavathi, Dheerendra Gopal, Loknath, M. N. Lakshmi Devi have come in for their share of applause. The film primarily revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his teacher, Chamayya( K. S. Ashwath). Chamayya, who is childless treats Ramachari( Vishnuvardhan) as his son. He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger. He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour. Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness. He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride. Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything. His love interests are Alamelu( Aarathi) and Margaret( Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life. The conversations between the Guru( Chamayya) and Shishya( Ramachari) is the highlight of movie all through. Chamayya and Ramachari have differences of opinion over what is right and wrong. Chamayya is more willing to blend in with the society than Ramachari and this usually ends in an argument between the two. It is possible that the society is the silent rhetoric for the title of the movie which spreads venom \u2014 a cobra. The movie was remade in Hindi as\" Zehreela Insaan\", in Tamil as\" Raja Nagam\" and in Telugu as\" Kode Nagu\". The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018.

It was published in Chicago by the general executive board of the IWW from 1921 to 1926, under various editors. The precursor of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" was the\" One Big Union Monthly\". The editor of\" One Big Union Monthly,\" John Sandgren, used his position to wage war on the Communists in the IWW. When his editorials became too sectarian, the IWW replaced him as editor in 1931, and changed the name of the publication to the\" Industrial Pioneer.\" The new editor was a Communist, however, and this alienated the non-Communist majority of IWW members. He was removed as editor in 1922. By the end of 1923, the IWW publications\" Industrial Pioneer\" and\" Industrial Worker\" were both nearly bankrupt. An organizer with experience in the Oklahoma oil fields, Frank Gallagher, became business manager for both. The\" Industrial Pioneer\" lived on, but after the 1924 split in the IWW, the union's decline as an actual labor organization is visible in the\" Industrial Pioneer,\" which became more purely educational and historical in flavor. In the words of IWW historian Melvyn Dubofsky, the\" Industrial Pioneer\" is \u201c one of the finest examples of the poetry, prose, fiction, art, and socioeconomic analysis produced in America \u2019s past by self- educated working- class radicals. \u201d The\" Industrial Pioneer\" reflected the strong influence of Marxism within the IWW, as well as an activist emphasis on workers \u2019 emancipation through control of industry. One academic article that refers to the\" Industrial Pioneer\" describes this intellectual culture of the IWW using the library of John Edwin Peterson, a rank- and- file Wobblie: \u201c Articles on the economic and technological development of the modern railway industry in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" were studied along with Pullman production manuals for the day when workers like Peterson would take over production. \u201d This focus on analyzing the nuts and bolts of capitalist industry went hand in hand with a desire to eliminate the wastefulness endemic to capitalism. In 1920, the IWW created the Bureau of Industrial Research to address such issues, in part due to the influence of the technocratic ideas of Howard Scott. In 1921, a series of articles by or about the Bureau appeared in the\" Industrial Pioneer\". Some of the regular features of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" were a section called \u201c The Question Box, \u201d where readers wrote in to have their questions answered, a humor section called \u201c Wobbles, \u201d a poetry section, numerous cartoons, and a page advertising subscriptions to the magazine. In 1923, for example, one could order an annual subscription to the\" Industrial Pioneer,\" and receive a book such as Karl Marx's\" Capital, Volume I\" along with the subscription, for a total of$ 3.25. Prominent IWW cartoonists such as Maurice Becker and Dust were regularly featured in the magazine. A good deal of space was often devoted to fiction and poetry. As the initial announcement in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" \u2019s first issue makes clear, the magazine dedicated itself not just to addressing labor and economic issues, but to providing a forum for \u201c proletarian art. \u201d The topic of Communism was clearly important for the IWW. The first, pro-Communist editor of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" published articles by Communists like Solomon Lozovsky and Karl Radek, but was not simply preaching Bolshevism. While he is uncritical of Communist tactics in Russia, he makes clear that purely economic action is called for in the United States. A later editor, writing an editorial on the death of Lenin in 1924, provides a typical Wobblie assessment: he praises Lenin \u2019s idealism, but notes that Lenin could not save the top- heavy \u201c workers \u2019 dictatorship, \u201d which rested on the misconception that \u201c all power resides in the state. \u201d Other topics treated in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" include relations between the sexes( Jennie Wilson,\" Modern Romance,\" May, 1923 issue), evolutionary theory( J. Howard Moore, \u201c Savage Survivals in Higher Peoples, \u201d June, 1923 issue), immigration( \u201c Some Anti-Immigration Fallacies, \u201d October, 1923 issue), and race relations( \u201c The Negro\u2014A Subject Race, \u201d April, 1924 issue). The\" Industrial Pioneer\" published some noteworthy figures in American labor history, including Eugene V. Debs, Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Ricardo Flores Magon, and Upton Sinclair. Upton Sinclair, for example, was involved with the free speech fight that grew out of a strike in San Pedro in 1923, and the August, 1923 issue of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" covers these events. Due to Sinclair \u2019s advocacy for free speech, the editor of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" wrote to Sinclair, and Sinclair wrote an article on\" Civil Liberties in Los Angeles,\" which criticized arrests for\" criminal syndicalism.\" In addition, \u201c The national office of the IWW began to give space in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" to reviews of Sinclair \u2019s literary efforts and sought to enlist him as a California speaker in its campaign for amnesty for political prisoners. \u201d\nDocument[6](Title: Atlas Preparatory School) Atlas Preparatory School is a middle school and high school in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nQuestion: Where did the composer of song Let'S Call The Whole Thing Off die?": [

He is an original character and does not appear in the television series, and should not be confused with the character of the same name from the serial\" Ghost Light\"( 1989). Nimrod works for the Forge, a top- secret organization responsible for experimenting with extraterrestrial material. During World War I Dr William Abberton was responsible for genetic experiments on vampire DNA \u2014 the so- called\" Project: Twilight\" \u2014 creating a hybrid race to act as super- soldiers. However, when the hybrids escaped, Abberton was mortally injured, only saving himself by injecting himself with the Twilight Virus, turning himself into a hybrid as well. He took the code name Nimrod, after the legendary hunter king, and hunted down the survivors of his vampire experiments. Over the years, he endured genetic alterations to stabilize his condition, even getting several cybernetic implants. Years later, he replaced Colonel Crichton as Deputy Director of the Forge. He first met the Sixth Doctor and Evelyn Smythe in 1999, while tracking down the last of the vampires to a casino called\" Dusk\". Evelyn befriended a girl who worked there called Cassie. Cassie had left her son Tommy with his grandmother up north while Cassie tried to earn a good living in London. But the vampires turned her into one of their own and she was the only one of them to escape when Nimrod destroyed the Dusk. He eventually found her in Norway, where the Doctor had left her while he tried to create a cure. He brainwashed her and made her his replacement field agent, Artemis. He then began work on\" Project: Lazarus\", a plan to create clones of the Doctor to discover the secrets of Time Lord regeneration. Once the Doctor had created a cure for the Twilight Virus, he and Evelyn returned to administer it to Cassie a few years later. But Nimrod captured the Doctor, took samples from his body and murdered Cassie before she could be cured. After the Doctor escaped, Nimrod started work on the cloning process, and succeeded in creating multiple identical versions of the Sixth Doctor. He clinically murdered many of them, but they all failed to regenerate. They were each short lived, but he kept them as a sort of pet, one at a time, dressing them like the real Doctor and tricking them into being his Scientific Adviser. After a few years of this, the Seventh Doctor arrived at the Forge and revealed the truth to his clone. Enraged by this, the replica Doctor destroyed the Forge. Nimrod escaped, but he believed it was the real Doctor that obliterated the facility. Although their building was gone, the Forge continued. They re-branded themselves as the public face of alien encounters. Even Nimrod became a public figure, now calling himself Sir William Abberton. But in 2026 a deadly alien mutagen escaped from the Forge, forcing most of London to be evacuated. The Seventh Doctor arrived in the middle of this emergency, but he was younger than the version that saw the destruction of the Forge two decades previously. With the Doctor were his companions Ace and Hex. Nimrod already knew that Hex was Cassie's son, now a grown man. He played on Hex's doubts and fears and confusion to drive a wedge between him and the Doctor. He even convinced Hex to resurrect the remains of his mother, but she returned as a monstrous zombie. However, her instincts were retained and she quickly turned on Nimrod and killed him. Meanwhile, the Forge was overthrown by his second in command, Captain Aristedes, whose initial hostility at the Doctor for his role in the destruction of the Forge shifted to Nimrod when the Doctor devised a cure for the mutagen that Nimrod explicitly modified to kill the victims rather than cure them. Aristedes thus implemented\" Project: Destiny\", and Nimrod and the Forge were destroyed. The book contains the short story\" Twilight's End\". The new Forge skyscraper was the most scientifically advanced building in the world, but it was hardwired to the remains of Nimrod, kept in a sealed vault deep below the property. The Seventh Doctor arrives, leaving a syringe containing the Twilight Cure, giving Nimrod the choice to use it.\nDocument[2](Title: Amlwch Town F.C.)

The embryonic development of the larva occurs as a series of stages. During stage 1, the first cleavage occurs, which gives rise to an AB and a CD blastomere, and is in the interphase of this cell division when a yolk- free cytoplasm called teloplasm is formed. The teloplasm is known to be a determinant for the specification of the D cell fate. In stage 3, during the second cleavage, an unequal division occurs in the CD blastomere. As a consequence, it creates a large D cell on the left and a smaller C cell to the right. This unequal division process is dependent on actomyosin, and by the end of stage 3 the AB cell divides. On stage 4 of development, the micromeres and teloblast stem cells are formed and subsequently, the D quadrant divides to form the DM and the DNOPQ teloblast precursor cells. By the end stage 6, the zygote contains a set of 25 micromeres, 3 macromeres( A, B and C) and 10 teloblasts derived from the D quadrant. The teloblasts are pairs of five different types( M, N, O, P, and Q) of embryonic stem cells that form segmented columns of cells( germinal band) in the surface of the embryo. The M- derived cells make mesoderm and some small set of neurons, N results in neural tissues and some ventral ectoderm, Q contributes to the dorsal ectoderm and O and P in the leech are equipotent cells( same developmental potential) that produce lateral ectoderm; however the difference between the two of them is that P creates bigger batches of dorsolateral epidermis than O. The sludgeworm\" Tubifex\", unlike the leech, specifies the O and P lineages early in development and therefore, these two cells are not equipotent. Each segment of the body of the leech is generated from one M, O, P cell types and two N and two Q cells types. The ectoderm and mesoderm of the body trunk are exclusively derived from the teloblast cells in a region called the posterior progress zone. The head of the leech that comes from an unsegmented region, is formed by the first set of micromeres derived from A, B, C and D cells, keeping the bilateral symmetry between the AD and BC cells.\nDocument[3](Title: The One and Only Ivan (film)) The One and Only Ivan is an upcoming American fantasy drama film directed by Thea Sharrock, from a screenplay written by Mike White, and based on the children's novel of the same name.

After the development of his electron capture detector, James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland. In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere. Once in the stratosphere, the sun's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond.\nDocument[5](Title: Afrikan P.

His court was in Ioannina, and the territory he governed incorporated most of Epirus and the western parts of Thessaly and Greek Macedonia. Ali had three sons: Muhtar Pasha, who served in the 1809 war against the Russians, Veli Pasha, who became Pasha of the Morea Eyalet and Salih Pasha, governor of Vlore. Ali first appears in historical accounts as the leader of a band of brigands who became involved in many confrontations with Ottoman state officials in Albania and Epirus. He joined the administrative-military apparatus of the Ottoman Empire, holding various posts until 1788 when he was appointed pasha, ruler of the sanjak of Ioannina. His diplomatic and administrative skills, his interest in modernist ideas and concepts, his popular piety, his religious neutrality, his suppression of banditry, his vengefulness and harshness in imposing law and order, and his looting practices towards persons and communities in order to increase his proceeds caused both the admiration and the criticism of his contemporaries, as well as an ongoing controversy among historians regarding his personality.

The Listing Rules themselves are given statutory authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and require that public listed companies disclose how they have complied with the code, and explain where they have not applied the code -- in what the code refers to as' comply or explain '. Private companies are also encouraged to conform; however there is no requirement for disclosure of compliance in private company accounts. The Code adopts a principles - based approach in the sense that it provides general guidelines of best practice. This contrasts with a rules - based approach which rigidly defines exact provisions that must be adhered to. In 2017, it was announced that the Financial Reporting Council would amend the Code to require companies to`` comply or explain'' with a requirement to have elected employee representatives on company boards.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Tammy And The T-Rex?": [

It is a brick building in the Colonial Revival architectural style built in the 1910s and expanded half a century later. In 2014 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Within two years of its establishment in 1850 the congregation hosted the Albany Convention, a gathering which helped Congregationalism develop a nationwide reach. The Rev. Ray Palmer, later known for his hymns, guided the church through its early years, when it was located in downtown Albany, first in a former Presbyterian church and later in its own building. In the early 20th century, the church followed its congregants in moving out towards the more suburban areas of Albany being developed along the city's trolley lines. The Fuller& Robinson Company designed the present church, following the Wren \u2013 Gibbs tradition. It was the first Colonial Revival church in the city, attracting much local media attention. Construction was delayed by the onset of World War I; it was formally dedicated to Ray Palmer in 1919. As one of the first churches to establish itself in those areas, it formed a social center of the new neighborhood. After World War II, plans went ahead to build a Sunday school wing intended for the original church. It was completed, in an architecturally sympathetic modernist style, by the early 1960s. It continues to have an active congregation, affiliated with both the United Church of Christ and National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.\nDocument[3](Title: Winds of the Pampas) Winds of the Pampas is a 1927 American silent drama film directed by Arthur Varney and starring Ralph Cloninger, Harry Holden and Vesey O'Davoren.\nDocument[4](Title: Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman) Look, Up in the Sky!

As an architect, Sambin worked on the designs for temporary festive structures for the Royal Entry into Dijon of Henri II and that of Charles IX( 1564), for which Sambin was coordinator; in more lasting commissions, he built the Parlement of Besan\u00e7on and the structure that is\" palais de Justice\" at Dijon, built to house the Parlement of Burgundy( 1572). Archival references have recently revealed that he had spent six months in 1544 working at the Palace of Fontainebleau, where the French Mannerist style was being rapidly evolved and perfected among the painters and stucco- workers and engravers of the School of Fontainebleau. The somewhat hectic and overcharged style of Hugues Sambin was one of the models employed in Renaissance Revival architecture of the second half of the nineteenth century.
