This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain.

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V.

Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods. Because of oil price increases after 2003, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) per day and was projected to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700,000 m3) per day by 2020. The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 billion barrels (50\u00d710^9 m3), which at a rate of 4,400,000 barrels per day (700,000 m3/d) would last about 200 years.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?": [

Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \"safe harbor\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \"mere conduit\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director was born first, 45 Fathers or The Intended?": [

In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\nDocument[5](Title: Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk (died 1715)) Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk( c. 1669 \u2013 10 August 1715), formerly Lady Henrietta Somerset, was the second wife of Henry Howard, 6th Earl of Suffolk.

The battle saw three top leaders of the Umayyad clan (Utba ibn Rabi'ah, Walid ibn Utbah and Shaybah) killed by Hashimites (Ali, Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith) in a three-on-three melee. This fueled the opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the grandson of Umayya, to Muhammad and to Islam. Abu Sufyan sought to exterminate the adherents of the new religion by waging another battle with Muslims based in Medina only a year after the Battle of Badr. He did this to avenge the defeat at Badr. The Battle of Uhud is generally believed by scholars to be the first defeat for the Muslims, as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans. After the battle, Abu Sufyan's wife Hind, who was also the daughter of Utba ibn Rabi'ah, is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Within five years after his defeat in the Battle of Uhud, however, Muhammad took control of Mecca and announced a general amnesty for all.

A popular\" traditional\" view among many Latter- day Saint faithful covers much of North and South America; while many Book of Mormon scholars, particularly in recent decades, believe the text itself favors a limited Mesoamerican or other limited setting for most of the Book of Mormon events.

There have also been multiple attempts to identify the several civilizations in the Book of Mormon, which are dated in the text as living from 2500 BC to 400 AD, but no consensus has ever been reached. According to Joseph Smith, an angel named Moroni told him\" there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.\" According to Joseph Smith, Moroni explained that the coming forth of the Book of Mormon was to be concurrent with the fulfillment of ancient prophecies regarding the latter- day church of Christ. According to Latter Day Saint scripture, the narrative in the Book of Mormon came to an end in the ancient land Cumorah, where Moroni, in 421 AD deposited the golden plates prior to his death. Mormon and Moroni's Cumorah is claimed by many believers to be the same land containing the modern\" Hill Cumorah\" near Joseph Smith's home in Palmyra, western New York, from whence the gold plates of the Book of Mormon were retrieved.

By marriage she was Duchess of Mecklenburg, although she died before her husband succeeded her father-in-law. She was potential heiress to the Danish throne and was the older sister of Margaret I of Denmark. Ingeborg was betrothed to Duke Henry of Mecklenburg after the death of Ingeborg's older sister Margaret in 1350, who was betrothed to the Duke. She had two sisters named Margaret. The marriage contract between Henry and Ingeborg was established in Dornburg October 23, 1350. Ingeborg and Henry then married in 1362. They had the following children:\nIngeborg was potential heir to the Danish throne in 1363 upon the death of her only surviving brother Christopher, Duke of Lolland. However, Denmark was an elective monarchy, and Ingeborg too predeceased King Valdemar. Ingeborg's father died without appointing an heir. The succession of to the Danish throne was disputed. The Estates of Denmark met at Odense to elect the next king. The nobles were divided between either electing Ingeborg's son Albert IV, put forth by his grandfather Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg; Margaret's son Olaf II, heir to the Norwegian throne; or choosing a new dynasty. The estates were eventually won over by Queen Margaret's charm and popularity, as the only surviving daughter of the deceased king, and along with the potential of a union with Norway and anti-German sentiments, Olaf II was elected as King of Denmark in 1376 with Queen Margaret as regent. With Albert III, Duke of Mecklenburg, Ingeborg's brother-in-law, on the Swedish throne, the Danish may not want another Mecklenburg ruler in Scandinavia.

He became the first monarch of the Kalmar Union between Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.

Since 1968 the party has appealed for constitutional negotiations on the matter of provincial sovereignty, in addition to holding two provincial referendums on the matter. The first, which occurred in 1980, asked whether Quebecers wished to open constitutional negotiations with the federal government (and other provinces) for the intended purpose of establishing a ``sovereignty - association ''pact between the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada. Approximately 60% of Quebec's voting public rejected the idea put forth by Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. The matter was dropped by the party for most of the 1980s, especially after the patriation of the Canadian constitution without the consent of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government, and the creation of the federal Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which enshrined the protection of the French language and French - Canadian culture in Canada. In 1995, after two failed attempts by the Mulroney government to secure Quebec's ratification of amendments to the constitution, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois held a second referendum, though on this occasion the question was, albeit obliquely asked, whether one wished for the independence of the province of Quebec from the rest of Canada.

Burrello, a songwriter and jazz pianist, and Murray started writing novelty songs after they were unsuccessful in having their more serious- minded songs recorded by prominent musicians. They noted the success of music that was seemingly intentionally bad, after hearing a disc jockey play Harry Stewart's version of\" Yes Sir, That's My Baby\" sung in Japanese and featuring a geisha orchestra. According to Murray, the disc jockey said that the record was one of the top hits but also\" one of the most horrible records he had ever heard\". Burrello and Murray responded by creating the songs\" There's a New Sound\" performed by Burello and\" Fish\" sung by Leona Anderson, which they released as a single. The former song's lyrics consist of a single chorus repeated five times, each time at a higher pitch. The lyrics describe a\" new sound ... the strangest sound that you have ever heard\", which turns out to be\" the sound that's made by worms\". Burrello was credited as the artist on the single, which was released on Burrello and Murray's own record label, Horrible, as catalog numbers H 100( ten- inch 78 rpm format) and H 100- X45( seven- inch 45 rpm format). It was the Horrible label's first and only release. When\" Billboard\" magazine reviewed the single, it commented,\" A weird one. ' The new sound is the sound made by worms.' Strange sound effects go with nonsense lyric. It's a studied attempt to be as screwy as possible. Quien Sabe?\" For the flip side,\" FishBillboard\" \u2032s review was\" Same comment\". Burrello and Murray originally had only 500 copies of\" There's a New SoundFish\" issued, to be sent to disc jockeys as a protest record. However, within two weeks, they received orders for more than 100,000 copies of the single. Soon afterward, Burrello and Murray were called upon to write a song for Brucie Weil, who was then 6 years old. The song they wrote for Weil,\" God Bless Us All\", reached# 18 on the\" Billboard\" singles chart. Burrello and Murray were soon called upon to write music for other artists, including a theme song for John Conte and special material for Tony Bennett. Anderson went on to exploit her newfound fame as a\" horrible\" musician( the schtick was a parody of opera singers who, in Anderson's opinion, could never\" kid themselves properly( or) let their voices go\") by making appearances on\" The Ernie Kovacs Show\" and recording a full- length album,\" Music to Suffer By\", in the same style she used for\" Fish.\" \" There's a New Sound\" was later featured often on the Dr. Demento show and performed by Scooter on\" The Muppet Show\".\nDocument[4](Title: Joseph Smith (footballer, born 1888)) Joseph\" Joe\" Smith( 1888 \u2013 January 1928) was an English footballer who played as a full- back.

Perhaps his greatest claim to fame is the fact that he is the only military opponent to force George Washington to surrender. Coulon was born into a prominent French Canadian family. His grandfather, Sieur Raoul- Guillaume Coulon, was a commandant in the French royal army. He was the son of Nicolas Antoine Coulon de Villiers and Elizabeth Le Couturier. Louis Coulon de Villiers entered the military in 1733. He had risen to the rank of captain by the outbreak of the French and Indian War and was assigned to Fort Duquesne. His half- brother, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, was killed by George Washington and his men after surrendering at the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Coulon sought justice and led an expedition to attack the British garrison at Fort Necessity under the command of George Washington. On the morning of July 3, 1754, Coulon's troops attacked Fort Necessity( See Battle of the Great Meadows). By evening, the British had asked for terms of surrender. It was the only time in Washington's long military career when he surrendered to an enemy. Coulon considered Washington personally responsible for his brother's death. He inserted a clause into the surrender document that described Jumonville's death as an\" assassination\". They read as follows: \u2026\" Since our intention[ as Canadiens] was never to disturb the peace and harmony which exist between two friends as two Prince allies, but only to avenge the assassination of one of our officers, messenger of a summon, and of his escorts, to prevent any establishment on the lands of her majesty, the King of France, my master.\"( abstract) The British were allowed to return to the security of their land with the honours of war, and the promise that they leave their settlements to the west of the Alleghany mountains during the twelve months that followed. They were made to promise the safe return of the prisoners taken during the attack on Joseph Coulon de Jumonville back to Fort Duquesne. The Canadiens also presented two prisoners; Robert Stobo and his interpreter, Jacob Van Braam, to demonstrate their respect of the clauses of surrender. The following day, the British left in haste. So quickly did they leave, that Washington left behind his journal in his abandoned luggage. The French Government used this content and the articles of surrender, to label the British as assassins and admitted terrorists. Washington denied having admitted to the murders. In accordance with his officers and colleagues, he maintained that the interpreter, when translating the act of surrender, had substituted the incriminating words of assassination by the words of death and killing. The British further declared that they had no intention of respecting the document that Washington had signed. The Canadian prisoners were not released; Stobo reneged on his word and became a spy; and by the end of the year, Washington accompanied Major General Edward Braddock on an assault on Fort Duquesne. In July and August 1756, Coulon led a column of French and Native Americans against the frontier of the Province of Pennsylvania. The expedition assaulted Fort Granville, near Lewistown, Pennsylvania, on August 2, and won the surrender of the fort on the following day. Coulon died of smallpox on November 2, 1757 at Quebec City.\n\nQuestion: Which film came out first, Celine: Through The Eyes Of The World or Dilan 1991?": [

It is located in the Westboro neighbourhood, at 574 Broadview Avenue. There were 1160 students enrolled for 2011 \u2013 2012. Krista McNamara is the current principal( since September 2019) replacing Renald Cousineau, the principal from 2017 to 2018. The two current vice principals are Aimee Barber and Peter Campbell. The school began as a continuation program at Broadview Public School. Students who wanted some years of secondary education, but were unable to travel to Ottawa Collegiate Institute could take a few courses on the top floor of Broadview. In 1919, the provincial government made school attendance mandatory until age 16, creating a rapid increase in enrollment. Carleton County thus decided to build a new high school, and Nepean High School, in Nepean Township, was founded in 1922. Nepean High School originally served a large territory west of Ottawa. In 1950, Westboro was annexed by the city of Ottawa, and the high school became part of the Ottawa Collegiate Board. In 1970, the Ottawa Collegiate Board was merged into the Ottawa Board of Education, and then in 1998, the Ottawa Board of Education and the Carleton Board of Education were amalgamated. Nepean High School then became part of the new Ottawa- Carleton District School Board. Nepean is known for its strong academic success with roughly 94% of students graduating to higher education( 53% being Ontario Scholars). Nepean's curricular offerings include Academic/ University, Applied/ College, French Immersion, Extended French, Specialist High Skills Major in the Environment, Advanced Placement Courses, Leadership Development, and Cooperative Education courses. The school is also well known for its excellent athletics program, with over 10 sports teams that are regular top contenders in the National Capital Secondary Schools Athletic Association. Nepean boasts one of the highest number of interscholastic sports teams in the Ottawa Carleton District School Board. Nepean was ranked first overall in the inaugural Ottawa Citizen High School Sports Rankings in 2006, and placed 3rd in 2009, 5th in 2010, and 3rd in 2011. Nepean attended the Ontario Championships( OFSAA) in boys Rugby( 2015, 2016), boys Soccer( 2007), girls Soccer( 2010), X- Country( 2006 \u2013 2011), Golf( 2007 \u2013 2011), Alpine Skiing( 2007 \u2013 2011), Nordic Skiing( 2006 \u2013 2011), Track& Field( 2006 \u2013 2011), Field Hockey( 2011, 2015, 2016), Tennis( 2010\u20132011), and Swimming( 2008 \u2013 2011).

The dominant rulers on the Coromandel Coast were the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah I, and the Nawab of the Carnatic, Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan.  The nawab nominally owed fealty to the nizam, but in many respects acted independently.  Fort St. George and the French trading post at Pondicherry were both located in the nawab's territory.The relationship between the Europeans in the region was influenced by a series of wars and treaties in Europe, and by commercial rivalries for trade on the subcontinent.  Through the 17th and early 18th centuries, the French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British had vied for control of various trading posts, and for trading rights and favour with local Indian rulers.  The European merchant companies raised bodies of troops to protect their commercial interests and latterly to influence local politics to their advantage. Military power was rapidly becoming as important as commercial acumen in securing India's valuable trade, and increasingly it was used to appropriate territory and to collect land revenue.\nDocument[6](Title: Why Do They Call It Love When They Mean Sex?)

The American upper middle class is defined using income, education, occupation and the associated values as main indicators.

One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?": [

Hailing from the Banu Wahb, a family of Nestorian Christian origin that had served in the caliphal bureaucracy since late Umayyad times, Ubayd Allah was the son and grandson of viziers. He had served as aide to his father, Ubayd Allah ibn Sulayman, during the latter's decade- long vizierate, and then succeeded him upon his death, heading the government during the last months of the reign of al- Mu'tadid and the early years of al- Muktafi. Al- Qasim largely dominated the young al- Muktafi, who awarded him with the title of Wali al- Dawla(\" Protector of the Dynasty\") and gave one of his daughters to one of al- Qasim's sons. Unlike his father, who was widely esteemed for his honesty and justice, al- Qasim was corrupt and cruel, ordering the executions of anyone that displeased him or presented a potential challenge, such as the Saffarid emir Amr ibn al- Layth, the general Badr al- Mu'tadidi, or the poet Ibn al- Rumi. The powerful finance secretary Ali ibn al- Furat was saved from a similar fate only by al- Qasim's illness and death.

She was the daughter of Emperor Galerius and his first wife, whose name is unknown. She married Maxentius around 293 (the exact date is unknown) in what was likely an attempt to forge an alliance between the families of Galerius and Maxentius' father Maximian, himself Emperor in the West. She bore two sons: the eldest, Valerius Romulus, was born c. 295; the other son's name is not recorded, but might be Aurelius Valerius, who was executed in 312. As an emperor's daughter, she was entitled \"nobilissima femina\". Her husband was acclaimed emperor in October 306 against the wishes of Valeria Maximilla's father, who tried to overthrow the usurper in 307 but without success. Maxentius remained the ruler of Rome, Italy and Africa until 312, when Constantine I invaded Italy. Valeria and her husband were together before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, when she disappears from the historical record. Her fate is unknown. Their son, Romulus, died in 309\nValeria Maximilla's portrait does not appear on any of the coinage issued under Maxentius, but she may have been depicted on a defaced sculpture now housed in the Capitoline Museums. If it is of Maximilla, it was likely defaced after her husband's overthrow, when his own images were also defaced. Maximilla may be the nameless queen who appears in the hagiography of St. Catherine of Alexandria by Jacobus de Voragine (one of the fantastic stories in the \"Golden Legend\"). In this story, the queen converted to Christianity after meeting with Catherine, and the both of them were then tortured and executed by Maxentius, depicted here as a persecutor of Christians.\nDocument[6](Title: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, who holds Narnia under an eternal winter without Christmas or Spring or Summer.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who is older, The Woman In The Fifth or End Of Winter?": [

He also served as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity from 1967 to 1968. During the Congo Crisis, Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of nationalist Patrice Lumumba in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba's execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country's armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965 to become the country's military dictator. To consolidate his power, he established the Popular Movement of the Revolution as the sole legal political party in 1967, changed the Congo's name to \"Zaire\" in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was \"neither left nor right, nor even centre\" but in practice he developed a far-right totalitarian regime, amassed vast personal wealth, and attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence through his program of \"national authenticity\". He was the object of a pervasive cult of personality. During his reign, Mobutu amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption, leading some to call his rule a \"kleptocracy\". The nation suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations. Mobutu received strong support (military, diplomatic and economic) from the United States, France and Belgium, who saw him as the strongest pillar of anti-communism in Francophone Africa; he also built close ties with the governments of Apartheid South Africa, Israel and the Greek military junta. From 1972 onwards, he was also supported by Mao Zedong of China, mainly due to his anti-Soviet stance, but also as part of Mao's attempts to create a bloc of Afro-Asian nations led by him; the massive Chinese economic aid that flowed into Zaire allowed Mobutu more flexibility in his dealings with Western governments, gave him the chance to portray himself as an \"anti-capitalist revolutionary\", and enabled him to avoid going to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. By 1991, economic deterioration and unrest led him to agree to share power with opposition leaders, but he used the army to thwart change until May 1997, when rebel forces led by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila expelled him from the country. Already suffering from advanced prostate cancer, he died three months later in Morocco. Mobutu became notorious for corruption, nepotism, and the embezzlement of between US$4 billion and $15 billion during his reign. He was known for extravagances such as shopping trips to Paris via the supersonic and expensive Concorde. He presided over the country for more than three decades, a period of widespread human rights violations.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Damage (Pharoahe Monch Song)?": [

Sheeley wrote the song when she was fifteen years old. She had met Elvis Presley, and he encouraged her to write. It was based on her disappointment following a short- lived relationship with a member of a popular singing duo. Sheeley sought Ricky Nelson to record the tune. She drove to his house, and claimed her car had broken down. He came to her aid, and she sprang the song on him. Her version was at a much faster tempo than his recording. The song was recorded by Ricky Nelson on April 17, 1958, and released on Imperial Records through its catalog number: 5528. On 4 August 1958 it became the first number- one song on\" Billboard\" magazine's then- new Hot 100 chart, replacing the magazine's Jockeys and Top 100 charts. It spent two weeks at the number- one spot. It also reached the top ten on the\" Billboard\" Country and Rhythm and Blues charts. Following its success, Sheeley worked with Eddie Cochran. \" Poor Little Fool\" became a radio hit when it was released as part of a four- song Extended Play 45 rpm disc which was excerpted from the artist's second LP,\" Ricky Nelson\". Responding to the buzz, Lew Chudd, the founder and head of Imperial Records, rushed out a single version( on both 45 and 78 rpm). Nelson objected, however, believing that the move would hurt sales of the EP. Under his contract with Imperial, the singer had approval rights for all picture- sleeve art and to express his displeasure with Chudd's decision, he chose not to select a photograph for the\" Poor Little Fool\" single. As a result,\" Poor Little Fool\" was the only Ricky Nelson single released by Imperial to be issued in the United States without a photo in a plain label- cut- out sleeve. The\" Dodgers\" and Johnny Angel released a cover version of the song in 1958 on Skyway 45- 119- AA. The Fleetwoods recorded it in 1962. Terry Black released a version of the song in 1965 on his debut album,\" Only 16\", and it reached# 6 in Canada.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Prince Charles Louis, Duke Of Chartres born?": [

He was born in Brignoles, into an artistic family that produced fourteen painters over six generations. His grandfather Georges Parrocel (1540- ca. 1614) (no surviving works) and his father Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1595\u20131660) were both painters. One badly restored painting of Bath\u00e9lemy survives in the church of Saint-Sauveur in Brignoles, France. His brothers Jean Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1631\u20131653) (no surviving works) and Louis Parrocel (1634\u20131694) also became painters. He was soon noticed He was only thirteen years old when his father died in 1660. His elder brother Louis, who was already established as a painter in the Languedoc, took him under his care and gave him a training as painter. Three years later he ran away from his brother's house to Marseilles. His talent as a painter became soon noticed and he got a commission for a number of paintings with scenes of the life of Saint Anthony of Padua for the church Saint-Martin. But he only executed two of them. it is also possible that he painted them during his second stay in the Provence. He left for Paris and stayed there for four years, perfecting his skills. He then returned to the Provence and continued his journey to Italy, where he would stay for eight years. In Rome he became the pupil of Jacques Courtois, a famous painter of battle scenes who was also known als \"le Bourguignon\" or \"il Borgognone\". He also studied the works of Salvator Rosa, an unorthodox proto-Romantic painter. Joseph Parrocel worked with him in his workshop and was thoroughly influenced by him, even if he gave his style later a more French touch. Parrocel then started a journey through Italy and finally arrived in Venice. He was planning to settle in this town but after eight brigands had attempted to murder him on the Rialto Bridge, he left Italy in disgust. He settled in Paris in 1675 and earned himself a reputation. He was accepted as an elected member at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 29 February 1676 and he became an academician on 14 November 1676 with his admission piece \"Siege of Maastricht\". In 1703 he became a councillor at the Academy. As a member of the Academy, he would obtain royal commissions. However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and the Palace of Versailles. During his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings. He died, aged 57, in Paris. He is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also landscapes, historical pieces and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the H\u00f4tel de Soubise and the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of the \"f\u00eates galantes\" of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes. His differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours. During his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University). Joseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690\u20131774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688\u20131752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667\u20131722) and Pierre (1670\u20131739), who both became painters and engravers.

He has directed music videos, commercials and documentary series for television, most recently\" Uffe \u2019s Alternative.\"( 2 episodes, DR 2015). He was educated at the National Film School of Denmark, graduating in 2005. His film\" Ballroom Dancer\"( 2011), won several awards from around the world. The film is a documentary portrait of a retired ballroom dancer, who attempts to return to the world elite; a quest with a high personal cost. The documentaries Bonke chooses to work on usually have a dramatic character. The person portrayed really develops and has a mission to accomplish. This gives Bonke the opportunity to work with a variety of dramatic and visual tricks, perhaps more typical from feature film. We see examples of this in\" First Love\"( 2007), and\" Ejersbo\". In the TV documentary\" Uffe's Alternative\", he follows politician Uffe Elb\u00e6k with his camera in the hectic period from the formation of the party The Alternative in November 2013, through to the June 2015 general election. The film joins the documentary style of the observing camera, or direct cinema, often used in political documentaries. Examples of note include US D.A. Penne Baker \u2019s\" The War Room\"( 1993) about Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and Christoffer Guldbrandsen's\" Fogh behind the facade\"( 2003) on Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's negotiations around the enlargement of the EU in 2002. A recurring theme in Bonke \u2019s films, regardless of form, is the fascination with someone who is truly passionate about an idea. His films are very personal portraits, and he always puts the human aspect at the apex.\nDocument[2](Title: Ee Snehatheerathu) Ee Snehatheerathu or Saamam is a 2004 Malayalam film directed by Prof. Sivaprasad and written by Dr. Ramakrishnan, starring Kunchacko Boban, Lal, Nedumudi Venu and Jagathy Sreekumar.

Benson, a local state representative, had the law amended in 1886 so that it allowed for the construction of a memorial hall, as the local G.A.R. chapter wanted it to be a place where they could meet.

Quijano was born in Corrientes Province in 1884, and enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires, where he graduated in 1908 and received a\" juris doctor\" in 1919. He became a prominent Corrientes Province supporter of the leader of the reformist UCR, Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen, at a time when local politics were dominated by the Autonomist and Liberal parties. His 1918 UCR candidacy for the Corrientes governorship was defeated, and he joined the legal department of the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina( the country's largest bank). Quijano broke with Yrigoyen's wing of the UCR and joined the opposition\" Anti- Personalist\" UCR. He left a thriving law practice in Corrientes in 1920 to invest in a logging venture in neighboring Chaco Province, and was named head of the Rural Society of Resistencia( Chaco), in 1936. He also parlayed his returns into the establishment of the\" Banco Popular\". The coup d'\u00e9tat of 1943 led to the advent of a populist leader, Col. Juan Per\u00f3n, whose labor law reform platform Quijano and others in the UCR supported. This support helped lead to Quijano's August 4, 1945 appointment as Interior Minister, a powerful position in Argentina at the time for its oversight of law enforcement. Per\u00f3n's success in an October 17 power struggle led to Quijano's establishment of the\" Renewal Group,\" a faction of the UCR endorsing Per\u00f3n for the upcoming February 1946 elections. These efforts earned Quijano Per\u00f3n's invitation as his running mate on the Labor Party ticket, which was comfortably elected. As Vice President, Quijano earned plaudits for his negotiations with neighboring Brazil, resulting in a temporary reintroduction of the ABC Pact that had included the two nations and Chile, earlier in the 20th century. Failing health, however, had forced Quijano to request his exclusion from the 1951 Per\u00f3n ticket. His prospective replacement, First Lady Eva Per\u00f3n, was in similarly poor health and, after she pleaded with him personally, he reluctantly agreed to join the Peronist ticket. Elected overwhelmingly in November 1951, Quijano died in early April, before being re-inaugurated. At the inauguration two months later, Evita, who had been given the title Spiritual Chief of the Argentine Nation but was herself soon to die as well, took his place.

The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost out to\" Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\". Alan Bergman would recall that after Michel Legrand had written eight melodies which were somehow not viable for the film, Marilyn Bergman suggested the opening line\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\", and Legrand then completed the song's melody based on that phrase. Marilyn Bergman would later comment on the double meaning of the phrase\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" within its parent film: as the romantic theme song's title the question overtly references the marriage proposal Mary Spencer( played by Jean Simmons) received and accepted sixteen years earlier but, as Mary's present- day angst becomes apparent,\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" is recast as a question Mary must ask herself. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was sung in\" The Happy Ending\" by Michael Dees whose version was included on the film's soundtrack album. The first evident\" outside\" cover was by Barbra Streisand who recorded the song on 24 September 1969 in the first session for her intended album\" The Singer\", with the track having a single release 26 October 1969. After two later sessions- in respectively March and April of 1970- Streisand had recorded a total of eight tracks toward\" The Singer\", only to have Clive Davis shelve the project in favor of an album which was soft rock rather than easy listening, with Streisand cutting the first tracks for what would be her 1971 album release\" Stoney End\" on 29 July 1970. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was utilized as the B-side of Streisand's# 1 hit\" The Way We Were\" released in 1973, and was included on the 1974 album release\" The Way We Were\". Although the Streisand version drew no evident attention in its original single release,\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" did reach the Easy Listening Top 40 ranking in\" Billboard\"- with a# 40 peak- via a January 1970 recording by veteran vocalist Jaye P. Morgan, whose version served as the title cut for her first album release in eight years( and her last until 1976). Also in 1970\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was recorded by Della Reese for her album\" Right Now\": the 9 November 1997 broadcast of the CBS series\" Touched by an Angel\" featured Reese's character; the angel Tess, singing the song in the guise of a supperclub singer .. \" What Are Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was also recorded by Dusty Springfield in 1970, in the July sessions at Trident Studios( Soho) for her\" See All Her Faces\" album, but despite Springfield having had a Top 40 hit with the Bergman's first Oscar- winning composition\" The Windmills of Your Mind\" her version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was cut from her upcoming album without being mixed, remaining\" in the can\" until 1994 when Philips Records put together the four volume box set\" Dusty: The Legend Of Dusty Springfield\" with a completed recording of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" being included on the disc devoted to\" Rarities\"( the track was in fact first released earlier in the year as a bonus on a CD single which paired Springfield's hits\" Goin' Back\" and\" Son- of- a Preacher Man\"). In 2006 Springfield's version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was featured in a 60- second commercial for diamonds- sponsored by the Diamond Trading Company- which aired on American television, in cinemas and online. In 1972 Sarah Vaughan recorded\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" for the album\" Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand\" on which Legrand acted as arranger and conductor. The track would win Legrand the 1972 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist. More than thirty years later, Billy Childs, Gil Goldstein, and Heitor Pereira won the 2006 Grammy Award for the same category for a version performed by trumpeteer Chris Botti and vocalist Sting on Botti's 2005 album\" To Love Again\".

Determined to become a jihadist, he went first to Bosnia and then, briefly, to Somalia before arriving in Afghanistan in 1996 in the hope of joining al- Qaeda, which he soon did. After four years, al- Bahri became\" disillusioned\", largely because bin Laden consolidated al- Qaeda's relationship with the Taliban by giving his bayat to its leader, Mullah Omar, but also because he had married and become a father. After his return to Yemen in 2000, he was taken into custody by the authorities and held for two years without trial.

This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.\nDocument[2](Title: The Slingshot (film)) The Slingshot  is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 24 September 1993, starring Jesper Sal\u00e9n, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Basia Frydman.

He was born in the Scottish town of Dunbar. He was the fourth son of Walter Runciman, master of a schooner and later a member of the coastguard, and Jane, oldest daughter of John Finlay, shipowner, also of Dunbar. The family moved to the coastguard station at Cresswell, Northumberland, because his father was appointed a position there. After attending a church school, the younger Walter ran away from home to work at sea in 1859. This explains why he was referred to by his grandson Steven as\" a Geordie of Scots descent who ran away to sea at 11, was a master mariner by 21 and founded a shipping line\", and, usefully for historians of a related area, Runciman wrote several books based on his years at sea. He also served briefly as a Liberal Member of Parliament. In 1889, Runciman founded the South Shields Shipping Company, based in the port of South Shields, on the south bank at the mouth of the River Tyne, which was then part of County Durham but now in Tyne and Wear. Walter Runciman was Managing Director and Secretary, and John Elliott was the chairman. In 1892 the company offices moved up the River Tyne to the city- port of Newcastle. In April 1897 the company changed its name to Moor Line Ltd. Runciman and his son, who had carried on business as partners in Runciman and Co, were appointed Managing Directors of Moor Line. Elliott died in 1898 and the elder Runciman held the position of Chairman until his death in 1937. Runciman was created a baronet in 1906, and served as Liberal MP for Hartlepool from 1914 to 1918. In 1910 he wrote\" The Tragedy of St. Helena\", an account of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile and death. In 1933, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Runciman of Shoreston. Four years later his son, the long- serving MP Walter Runciman( 1870 \u2013 1949), followed him into the House of Lords with the title Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford. A large inheritance bestowed to his grandson Steven Runciman, enabled him to become an independent scholar who travelled widely and was a leading scholar of the Crusades.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Slingshot (Film) born?": [

It is a slow twelve- bar blues performed in the West Coast blues- style that features Walker's smooth, plaintive vocal and distinctive guitar work. As well as becoming a record chart hit in 1948, it inspired B.B. King and others to take up the electric guitar. \" Stormy Monday\" became Walker's best- known and most-recorded song. In 1961, Bobby\" Blue\" Bland further popularized the song with an appearance in the pop record charts. Bland introduced a new arrangement with chord substitutions, which was later used in many subsequent renditions. His version also incorrectly used the title\" Stormy Monday Blues\", which was copied and resulted in royalties being paid to songwriters other than Walker. The Allman Brothers Band recorded an extended version for their first live album in 1971, with additional changes to the arrangement. Through the album's popularity and the group's concert performances, they brought\" Stormy Monday\" to the attention of rock audiences. Similarly, R&B singer Latimore's 1973 hit recording made it popular with a later R&B audience. \" Stormy Monday\" is one of the most popular blues standards, with numerous renditions. As well as being necessary for blues musicians, it is also found in the repertoires of many jazz, soul, pop, and rock performers. The song is included in the Grammy, Rock and Roll, and Blues Foundation halls of fame as well as the U.S. Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.\nDocument[2](Title: Sebasti\u00e1n Borensztein) Sebasti\u00e1n Borensztein (born 22 April 1963, in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine writer and director.

He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name \"Jack Sparrow\"; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, \"a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate.\" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, \"He's ruining the film!\" Depp answered back, \"Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.\"\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, Red Sparrow or The Flying Liftboy?": [

In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin \u2019s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics \u2014 a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. \" Les Lignages d\u2019 Outremer\" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary.\nDocument[6](Title: Le Beau Mariage) Le Beau Mariage(\" The Good Marriage\") is a 1982 French film directed by \u00c9ric Rohmer, starring B\u00e9atrice Romand, Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, F\u00e9odor Atkine.

It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood. During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence. Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost. In the second step, platelet plug formation, platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall. The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting. Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a ``molecular glue ''. Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process. They allow for the creation of the`` platelet plug'' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured. Within seconds of a blood vessel's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface. It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound. After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin. Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms:\nDocument[5](Title: Donika Kastrioti) Donika Kastrioti (n\u00e9e Andronika Arianiti-Muzaka) was an Albanian noblewoman and the spouse of George Kastrioti Skanderbeg.

He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 23 Chevrolet Camaro for GMS Racing. He won the 1988 Winston Cup Championship and garnered 44 wins in that series, including two Daytona 500 victories in 1985 and 1987, three Southern 500 victories in 1985, 1988, and 1994, one Winston 500 victory in 1985, one Brickyard 400 victory in 2002, one \"The Winston All-Star Race\" (non-points race) win in 1986, and a record four consecutive wins at Michigan International Speedway between 1985 and 1986 (7 wins overall at Michigan, the most at any one racetrack in his career). He holds the track record for fastest qualifying speed at Talladega at and Daytona International Speedway at , both of which were set in 1987; the mark at Talladega is the fastest qualifying speed for any NASCAR race ever. With the current usage of restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega beginning since 1988, it is highly unlikely that these two qualifying speed records will ever be topped again. In 1985, Elliott made history by winning the first ever Winston Million: A million dollar bonus to any driver that could win three out of the four crown jewel races of NASCAR: The Daytona 500 at Daytona, the Winston 500 at Talladega, the World 600 at Charlotte, and the Southern 500 at Darlington. In a year dominated by Elliott, Bill went on to win 11 races (with 4 \"season sweeps\": Atlanta, Pocono, Michigan, and Darlington) and 11 poles, with three of those 11 wins being in the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, and the Southern 500, earning Bill the \"Winston Million Dollar Bonus\" and earning him the nickname \"Million Dollar Bill\". Elliott won NASCAR's Most Popular Driver Award a record 16 times (1984-1988, 1991-2000, 2002). He withdrew his name from the ballot for that award after winning it in 2002. In 2005, the Georgia State Legislature declared October 8 as Bill Elliott Day in the state of Georgia. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America on August 15, 2007 and into the 2015 class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

He has worked in various films, including Bollywood as well as other regional cinemas. He has won the National Film Award for Best Make- up Artist two times for the Bengali film\" Moner Manush\" in 2010, for his works in the Marathi film\" Balgandharva\", the Hindi film\" The Dirty Picture\" in 2011 and again in a Bengali film Jaatishwar in the 61st National Film Awards. He has also done a cameo role in the 2012 Marathi film\" Tukaram\" and Lokmanya Ek Yugpurush. About Moner Manush The National Award has given make- up artist Vikram Gaikwad the coveted recognition of his behind- the- scenes hard work All those hours of visualising the film's character, working on the actor's make- up and paying attention to intricate facial features have paid off for make- up artist Vikram Gaikwad. On Thursday, this city- based artist won the National Award for Best Make- up Artist for his work in the Bengali film Moner Manush. It was Gaikwad's job to transform the actor into Fakir Lallan Shah, the 19th century philosopher, spiritual leader and musician from Bengal on whom the film is based. \" The film tells the story of the life and times of Fakir Lallan Shah. So through the make- up, I had to show the fine changes in his facial features as he grew from a 24- year- old man to a 70- year- old,\" says Gaikwad who has been in the industry for two decades. He made use of prosthetic make- up for Moner Manush. \" Throughout the film, I chose not to use wigs for the character's hair. Instead, I stuck actual hair which gave the appearance of a wanderer to Lallan,\" he adds. Thrilled at his win, an acknowledgement of his hard work, the artist says,\" A National Award is an important benchmark for any artist connected to the film- making business. These awards honour talent. I was hoping to win but with the good work done by so many artistes across the country, I was n't very sure that the honour would be mine.\" Moner Manush, directed by acclaimed Bengali director Gautam Ghose, is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sunil Ganguly. It stars Prosenjit Chatterjee in the lead role and focuses on the Baul style of music that was popularised by Fakir Lallan Shah. Gaikwad, who has also worked as a make- up artist at the Film and Television Institute of India( FTII) Pune from 1983- 1988 says that a make- up artist should have a fixed idea about how the finished character will look. \" When I was showing Lallan as an old man, I knew I wanted to depict a godlike aura on his face. I had famous historian Babasaheb Purandare in mind while doing the make- up. It took two hours to achieve the desired effect through prosthetic make- up,\" he reveals.\nDocument[6](Title: Juan van Emmerloot) Juan van Emmerloot( born 12 November 1965 in Waalwijk) is a drummer, music producer and composer.

Even the school colors of red, white, and blue are a patriotic symbol of history. In 1969, Patrick Henry High and John M. Gandy High School merged to form one integrated student body. Also in 1969, a new junior high school was built, and Patrick Henry opened that school year as a senior high school serving students in grades ten through twelve. When the junior high school was changed to a middle school in 1988, Patrick Henry became a high school enrolling students in grades nine through twelve. The school campus of West Patrick Henry Road, which consists of a complex of buildings, began as a campus style school. Additions of an auditorium, classrooms, cafeteria, new gymnasium, and renovations to the media center and administrative offices resulted in an all- enclosed facility in 1992.

Starring Rory Calhoun, it is a fictional account of the island of Rhodes during its Classical period in the late third century before coming under Roman control, using the Colossus of Rhodes as a backdrop for the story of a war hero who becomes involved in two different plots to overthrow a tyrannical king: one by Rhodian patriots and the other by Phoenician agents. The film was Leone's first work as a credited director, in a genre where he already had worked before (as the replacement director for \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" and as a secondary director for both \"Ben-Hur\" and \"Quo Vadis\"). It is perhaps the least known of the eight films he directed, and is notable for being one of only two of these films without an Ennio Morricone score. The film is also notable for its unusual time period: The time following Alexander the Great\u2019s death (323 BC) but before the rise of the Roman empire (27 BC), known as the Hellenistic era. Most sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950s and 1960s were set in either classical Greece or even earlier (\"Hercules,Ulysses,The Giant of Marathon\") or the later Roman period (\"Ben Hur,The Magnificent Gladiator,Quo Vadis\").

It depicts the life of Frederick the Great, who ruled Prussia from 1740 to 1786. It received the rare \"Film of the Nation\" distinction. It was part of a popular cycle of \"Prussian films\". The film is a depiction of the F\u00fchrerprinzip, with the analogy to Adolf Hitler being so clear that Hitler sent a print to Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Goebbels warned against the drawing of the comparison in print, in particular, because of the pessimistic mood that opens the film. After a sergeant gives an unauthorised order, the king orders him simultaneously promoted and punished. His decision to desert after this results in his death, because no disobedience is justified. Goebbels declared that the parallels were not a matter of propaganda, but an obvious result of the parallels of history. Goebbels also regarded it as instructive that current sufferings would be a source of strength. Goebbels had some difficulty with the Army High Command over this film, because it depicted the king left in the lurch by his general.

He is often referred to as the\" Father of Cobalt,\" an unofficial title shared by the province of Ontario's first geologist, Dr. W. G. Miller( 1866- 1925). Silver had first been discovered near Long Lake( later Cobalt Lake, Ontario), during the construction of the Temiskaming& Northern Ontario Railway( T&NO) from North Bay, by J. H. McKinley and Ernest Darragh, which then became the McKinley- Darragh Mine. Darragh and McKinley had made their find on August 7, 1903, while supplying railway ties, and kept it secret at the onset, while quickly filing their new claim on August 14. A month later, La Rose, a blacksmith, unaware of the recent silver find, made his discovery while working for brothers Duncan and John McMartin, also in the construction of the T&NO, at Mile 103 from North Bay, where he'd built a small cabin. La Rose had an arrangement with the McMartins to share in any mineral claims that he found in the course of his work, and chanced upon Erythrite, often an indication of associated cobalt and native silver. ( A fanciful story later developed that La Rose discovered the vein when he threw a hammer at a pesky fox.) Mattawa, Ontario shopkeeper Noah Timmins was informed of the claim by La Rose who, at the end of his contract, had stopped at the Timmins brothers' general store while returning home to Hull, Quebec. Noah cabled his brother, Henry Timmins, who was in Montr\u00e9al at the time and immediately set out for Hull, where he met with La Rose and offered him$ 3,500 for a quarter share of the claim, effectively partnering with the McMartin brothers. La Rose was subsequently fully bought- out by the Timmins and McMartin brothers, who, following a protracted legal battle over the land with M.J. O'Brien, added a third partner, lawyer R. A. Dunlop, who then organized the La Rose Mines, Limited, incorporating February 21, 1907. The company remained a closed corporation until 1908, when the La Rose Consolidated Mines Company was organized. A third discovery, made October 21, 1903, by Thomas\" Tom\" H\u00e9bert \u2013 a Hull, Quebec lumberjack who was then working for the J. R. Booth Lumber Company, and had set out to seek employment with the T.& N. 0. Railway \u2013 became the successful Big Nip mine, and was\" the first vein on the property now owned by the Nipissing Mining Company\". Metals discovered by La Rose and, previously, by the team of McKinley and Darragh, and then by H\u00e9bert, would spark international interest, culminating in the Cobalt silver rush. The LaRose Mine was closed in 1930, and the location became the main office of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited in Cobalt.\nDocument[2](Title: Leo Ieiri) Her stage name comes from the movie, and also comes from Leo of\" Kimba the White Lion\" because her eyes resemble a lion.\nDocument[3](Title: Bachelor Brides) Bachelor Brides is a 1926 American silent comedy film directed by William K.

The partitioning was planned in several agreements made by the Allied Powers early in the course of World War I, notably the Sykes - Picot Agreement. As world war loomed, the Ottoman Empire sought protection but was rejected by Britain, France, and Russia, and finally formed the Ottoman -- German Alliance. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states. The Ottoman Empire had been the leading Islamic state in geopolitical, cultural and ideological terms. The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire led to the rise in the Middle East of Western powers such as Britain and France and brought the creation of the modern Arab world and the Republic of Turkey. Resistance to the influence of these powers came from the Turkish national movement but did not become widespread in the post-Ottoman states until after World War II.\nDocument[6](Title: George VI) In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife.

It is located in Hamilton County, New York in the West Canada Lake Wilderness Area. T Lake Falls with a height stated of 350 feet up to 600, depending on the source, reasoning behind judgment of the height is the crescent edge at the top of the falls and where the falls officially start. T Lake and the falls have been an attraction because of the several different ways to hike in, and the option of staying at the lean- to at the lake. There is also swimming in the pool at the bottom of the falls in the summer months and snow shoeing, cross-country skiing to the falls to go ice climbing in the winter. The height makes the falls a dangerous place, and several fatalities have occurred there; a 14- year- old boy fell 200 feet into the pool at the bottom of the falls during a summer camp hiking trip on Aug 18, 1960. A 17- year- old girl lost her footing crossing the top of the falls and uncontrollably tumbled down 600 feet on Aug 29, 1973. The coroner \u2019s physician said she \u2018 died of massive head injuries.' Other fatalities that have occurred there were on July 5, 1965 a male went over the falls and died, on Aug 1, 1993 another male went over the falls and died. Rescuers must hike at least 5 miles just to get to endangered persons, and they are sometimes brought out on horseback. There are several memorials at the bottom of the falls for all the people that have lost their lives. Because of these fatalities, the trail beyond the lake and lean- to to the falls are no longer maintained and have been closed by DEC. However some hikers still venture to the falls on their own. The falls is on an unnamed tributary of the South Branch West Canada Creek. This area was used by Native American hunters and first settlers. There are three different ways of hiking into these falls; two of them are from Piseco, NY and the third is from Noblesboro, NY off Mountain Rd. First, is the actual trail head across the road from Poplar Point state campsite. There is a trail sign marking where it begins and states that it is 3.6 miles to the lake where the lean- to is. After the lake, is a 1.8 mile hike to the falls on an unmaintained trail that is difficult to follow. The other way in, coming from Piseco, is bushwhacking off the Mill Stream trail starting on Haskell \u2019s Road. This way in is considered easier because the trail is flatter, if one has the skills of bushwhacking, from Mill Stream to the state trail. The third way in is off Mountain Home Road, which brings one to the bottom of the falls. It is also the shortest: 5 miles from the trail head to the falls.\nDocument[6](Title: Arthur Benjamin) Arthur Leslie Benjamin( Sydney, 18 September 1893 London, 10 April 1960) was an Australian composer, pianist, conductor and teacher.

With the beginnings of modern biological taxonomy in the late 17th century, two opposed ideas influenced Western biological thinking: essentialism, the belief that every species has essential characteristics that are unalterable, a concept which had developed from medieval Aristotelian metaphysics, and that fit well with natural theology; and the development of the new anti-Aristotelian approach to modern science: as the Enlightenment progressed, evolutionary cosmology and the mechanical philosophy spread from the physical sciences to natural history. Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature. In the early 19th century Jean - Baptiste Lamarck (1744 -- 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution.\n\nQuestion: Who is Sir William Gore, 3Rd Baronet's paternal grandfather?": [

Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete.

Deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding Predynastic Period (before 3100 BC) and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs. Predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures. Some of these images, such as stars and cattle, are reminiscent of important features of Egyptian religion in later times, but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities. As  Egyptian society grew more sophisticated, clearer signs of religious activity appeared. The earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era, along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities: the falcon that represents Horus and several other gods, the crossed arrows that stand for Neith, and the enigmatic \"Set animal\" that represents Set.\nDocument[5](Title: Jazmyne Denhollander) Jazmyne Denhollander( born January 8, 1994 in Chilliwack, British Columbia) is a Canadian slalom canoeist.\nDocument[6](Title: Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium) Louis- Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium( Louis Philippe L\u00e9opold Victor Ernest; 24 July 1833 \u2013 16 May 1834), was the eldest child and heir- apparent of King Leopold I of the Belgians and his second wife, Princess Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans.\n\nQuestion: Who is the maternal grandfather of Princess Louise Of Belgium?": [

This region is believed to contribute to the cognitive defects of Down syndrome. The substantial increase in the number of forebrain inhibitory neurons often observed in Ts65dn mouse (a murine model of trisomy 21) could lead to imbalance between excitation and inhibition and behavioral abnormalities. However, genetic reduction of OLIG2 and OLIG1 from three copies to two rescued the overproduction of interneurons, indicating the pivotal role of OLIG2 expression level in Down syndrome. The association between OLIG2 and neural diseases (i.e. schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease) are under scrutiny, as several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these diseases in OLIG2 were identified by genome-wide association work.\nDocument[4](Title: Frank Oliver (politician)) Francis\" Frank\" Oliver( born Francis Robert Oliver Bowsfield; September 1, 1853 \u2013 March 31, 1933) was a Canadian federal minister, politician, and journalist from the Northwest Territories and later Alberta.

Shaughnessy was born in South London in a working class Irish family. He studied drama at the Rose Bruford College, Sidcup, from 1983 to 1986. He then worked in a children's home and as a carer for people with disabilities, before becoming a bus driver in 1990 on London Buses route 36. In April 1992, coming to the aid of a conductor who was being assaulted, Shaughnessy was hit with an iron bar. Shortly afterwards he went on a silent hunger strike outside his bus garage in protest at the privatisation of the service, which was leading to more work for less pay. By the end of the year he was hospitalised. The diagnostic category applied was manic depression. Shaughnessy organised a' Reclaim Bedlam' campaign in the late 1990s, initially to protest against anniversary celebrations of the Bethlem Hospital. They then protested the offices of the charity SANE and its head Marjorie Wallace who was campaigning for Compulsory Treatment Orders( outpatient commitment) \u2013 she changed tack following the adverse publicity. From there Shaughnessy started Mad Pride with fellow activists Robert Dellar, Simon Barnett and Mark Roberts. During 2000, with punk- style campaigns and humour, they helped prevent certain changes to the Mental Health Act. According to Ben Watson( music writer),\" Shaughnessy \u2019s courage and humour and sheer bloody- mindedness shifted something. Permanently.\" According to Phil Barker, the UK's first Professor of Psychiatric Nursing Practice,\" His campaigning and direct actions helped push the government on to the back foot over their plans for forced drug treatment for the mentally ill in the community. He fought against the stigma surrounding mental illness with passion, compassion and humour.\" On 15 December 2002, Shaughnessy committed suicide by stepping in front of a train at Battersea Park railway station in London. His last known contact had been on 13 December at the NHS Acre day hospital in what was by then his home town of Worthing on the south coast.

Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern, progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution. Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, but also by legal precedence, making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era, and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution.\n\nQuestion: What is the date of death of Fitzroy Somerset, 5Th Baron Raglan's father?": [

However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and the Palace of Versailles. During his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings. He died, aged 57, in Paris. He is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also landscapes, historical pieces and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the H\u00f4tel de Soubise and the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of the \"f\u00eates galantes\" of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes. His differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours. During his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University). Joseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690\u20131774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688\u20131752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667\u20131722) and Pierre (1670\u20131739), who both became painters and engravers. A number of his paintings are now suggested to be early works of his nephew Jacques-Ignace Parrocel (1667\u20131722)\nDocument[6](Title: Judith of Bavaria, Duchess of Swabia) Judith of Bavaria, Duchess of Swabia (19 May 1100 \u2013 27 Aug 1130) was a Duchess of Swabia by marriage to Frederick II, Duke of Swabia.

It was written by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The production was done by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy.

With the work on the track being finished, it was forwarded to Rihanna and her label, which eagerly accepted it. \"Watch n' Learn\" is a dancehall song with prominent reggae characteristics. The song's instrumentation uses finger-snapping, percussions, background clicks, synths and \"island-flavored\" drum beat. Lyrically, it is about a woman who teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, throughout which she uses sexual references. \"Watch n' Learn\" received predominantly positive reviews from music critics, with many of them praising its composition and sound.

The school, which serves over 800 students with 62 full-time educators (11:1), is located on Illinois Place in Vogelweh. KHS is part of the DoDEA (Department of Defense Education Activity) as well as DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependents Schools) system. KHS is located in the Kaiserslautern District, one of the six European school districts run by DoDEA, and is one of the largest DoDDS schools by population in Europe. KHS serves students of the KMC (Kaiserslautern Military Community). With approximately 50,000 American inhabitants, KMC is the largest community of Americans outside the United States. Shortly after the development of Western Area Command (WACOM) in 1952, when Americans took over the western area of Germany from the French, KHS was housed in a converted apartment building. On March 12, 1953, the school moved into an old hospital building and expanded continuously over the years. From 1953 to 1958, the school included a dormitory for approximately 150 French and German students. The school was originally known as Rhine High, not being referred to as \"KAHS\" until the early sixties, and \"KHS\" fairly recently. The school grew quickly, in 1982 KHS (with an enrollment of more than 1600 students) was the largest military-operated high school outside the continental US. Today, Kaiserslautern High School's enrollment has increased due to the relocation of military forces in Europe. Nevertheless, KHS is known for providing excellent education and has a graduation rate of over 85%. When compared to other DoDEA schools, KHS ranks first in standardized test scores. With an annual tuition of approximately $26,000, KHS is also a rather expensive institution (due to being concerned a private school) . However, dependents of the military, Department of Defense contractors, NATO members and retired military dependents are exempt from paying. KHS is fully accredited by the North Central Association for Accreditation (NCAA). Every five years the school is visited by North Central to assess the success of the school's individual school improvement plan.

Nur Jahan was born Mehr-un-Nissa, the daughter of a Grand Vizier (Minister) who served under Akbar. Nur Jahan, meaning 'Light of the World', was married at age 17 to a Persian soldier Sher Afgan, governor of Bihar, an important Mughal province. She was a married woman when Prince Salim (the future Emperor Jahangir), Akbar's eldest son, fell in love with her. Two years after Akbar died and Salim became Emperor, Sher Afgan met his death. However, three more years were to pass before a grieving Nur Jahan consented to marrying the Emperor Jahangir. Although Jahangir was deeply in love with Nur Jahan, their actual story bears no resemblance to the entirely fictional legend of Anarkali, a low-born dancing girl who, according to popular folklore and film-lore, had a tragic and doomed love affair with Jahangir. In fact, the relationship between Jahangir and Nur Jahan was even more scandalous in its time than the legend of Anarkali, for Nur Jahan was a widowed woman when the Emperor fell in love with her. A school of historians still believe, though without credible evidence, that Jahangir (then Salim) was already in love with Nur Jahan (then Mehr-un-Nissa) when she was initially married to Sher Afgan. Thwarted by Akbar in his attempts to marry her then, Jahangir plotted to get Sher Afgan killed on the pretext of treachery to finally marry Nur Jahan. However, this theory lacks sound evidences and seems far-fetched. After her wedding to emperor Jahangir, Nur Jahan's rise to power was swift. A strong, charismatic, and well-educated woman who enjoyed the absolute confidence of her husband, Nur Jahan was the most powerful and influential woman at court during a period when the Mughal Empire was at the peak of its power and glory. More decisive and proactive than her husband, she is considered by historians to have been the real power behind the throne for more than fifteen years. Nur Jahan was granted certain honours and privileges which were not enjoyed by any Mughal empress before or after. She was the only Mughal empress to have coinage struck in her name. She was often present when the Emperor held court, and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell. She was given charge of his imperial seal, implying that her perusal and consent were necessary before any document or order received legal validity. The Emperor sought her views on most matters before issuing orders. The only other Mughal empress to command such devotion from her husband was Nur Jahan's niece Mumtaz Mahal, for whom Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum. However, Mumtaz took no interest in affairs of state and Nur Jahan is therefore unique in the annals of the Mughal Empire for the political influence she wielded.\nDocument[2](Title: List of most expensive films) Due to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made.

Murder Ahoy! is the last of four Miss Marple films made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that starred Margaret Rutherford. As in the previous three, the actress plays Agatha Christie's amateur sleuth Miss Jane Marple, with Charles 'Bud' Tingwell as (Chief) Inspector Craddock and Stringer Davis (Rutherford's real-life husband) playing Mr Stringer. The film was made in 1964 and directed by George Pollock, with David Pursall and Jack Seddon credited with the script. The music was by Ron Goodwin. Location shots included Denham Village and St Mawes, Cornwall. Unlike the previous three films that were adapted from Christie novels \u2013 \"The 4.50 from PaddingtonMurder, She Said\" \u2013 the only Miss Marple novel used), \"After the Funeral\" (a Poirot mystery, adapted for Miss Marple with the title \"Murder at the Gallop\") and \"Mrs. McGinty's Dead\" (another Poirot novel, adapted as \"Murder Most Foul\") \u2013 this film used an original screenplay that was not based on any of Christie's stories. It does, however, employ elements of the Miss Marple story \"They Do It With Mirrors\". Specifically, the \"Battledore\" is a training ship for teenage boys with criminal tendencies, who are supposedly being set on the straight and narrow path \u2013 when, in fact, one of the members of the crew is training them for careers in housebreaking. Likewise, in \"They Do It With Mirrors\", Lewis Serrocold is running his wife's mansion, Stonygates, as a boarding school for delinquent youths, to straighten out their lives \u2013 but, in fact, he is training selected students to hone their criminal skills, not to give them up. That is the only element borrowed into the film from a Christie story. There is also an entirely tongue-in-cheek reference to \"The Mousetrap\", the Christie play that has been running continuously on the West End since 1952. Audiences who see \"The Mousetrap\" are asked to keep the ending a secret, so it is amusing when Rutherford's Miss Marple says that she's reading a \"rattling-good detective yarn\" and \"I hope I won't be giving \"too\" much away if I say the answer is a mousetrap!\" She then notes that she'll \"say no more \u2013 otherwise, I'll spoil it for you!\"\nDocument[3](Title: Bridge over the Elbe) Bridge over the Elbe or The Legion of No Return (Italian:Quel maledetto ponte sull'Elba, Spanish: No importa morir) is a 1969 Italian-Spanish war film directed by Le\u00f3n Klimovsky and starring Tab Hunter, Howard Ross and Erika Wallner.\nDocument[4](Title: Bridge over the Elbe) Bridge over the Elbe or The Legion of No Return( Italian: Quel maledetto ponte sull' Elba, Spanish: No importa morir) is a 1969 Italian- Spanish war film directed by Le\u00f3n Klimovsky and starring Tab Hunter, Howard Ross and Erika Wallner.\nDocument[5](Title: Morris (cartoonist)) Maurice De Bevere( 1 December 1923 \u2013 16 July 2001), better known as Morris, was a Belgian cartoonist, comics artist, illustrator and the creator of\" Lucky Luke\".

The hotel was located on the Wabash River next to the Grand Rapids Dam on land that was originally purchased by Thomas S. Hinde. Before the hotel was built, the property where the hotel was located was a site of a former homestead, and was used by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman for multiple small shops that sold goods to fisherman and tourists. Frederick Hinde Zimmerman was the founder and owner of the hotel, and he completed construction and opened the hotel to the public on August 7, 1922. The hotel had 36 rooms and one large assembly room that served as a dining room, meeting hall, and was used for weddings, exhibitions, anniversaries, and other important occasions. The hotel was one of the first major resorts on the southern portion of the Wabash River and quickly was able to attract tourist from across the country because of its location on the river and ease of access provided by the railroad. During its nine- year existence the hotel established a reputation for luxury and high quality. In later years, after manager Glenn Goodart took over operation of the hotel, it gradually began to lose patronage due to incompetent business planning and flooding of the Wabash River in the summers of 1927, 1928, and 1929. On July 29, 1929, Glenn Goodart burned the Grand Rapids Hotel to the ground by dropping a blowtorch in the basement shop.

His family being from Franconia, he founded the convent of St Margarethen in Waldkirch to extend his family's influence into the Rhineland. On his father's arrest and execution for high treason in 911, he and his wife, Regelinda, daughter of Count Eberhard I of Z\u00fcrich, went to Italy: either banished by Count Erchanger or voluntarily exiling themselves to their relatives over the Alps. Around 913, Burchard returned from exile and took control over his father's property. In 915, he joined Erchanger and Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, in battle at Wahlwies. Following the battle, Erchanger was proclaimed duke. After Erchanger was executed on 21 January 917, Burchard seized all his lands and was recognised universally as duke. In 919, King Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy seized the county of Z\u00fcrich and invaded the region of Konstanz, then the centre and practical capital of the Swabian duchy. At Winterthur, however, Rudolph was defeated by Burchard, who thus consolidated the duchy and forced on the king his own territorial claims. In that same year, he recognised the newly elected king of Germany, Henry the Fowler, duke of Saxony. Henry in turn gave Burchard rights of taxation and investiture of bishops and abbots in his duchy. In 922, Burchard married his daughter Bertha to Rudolph and affirmed the peace of three years prior.

Burchard attacked Novara, defended by the troops of Lambert, Archbishop of Milan. There he was killed, probably on 29 April.

There have been several proposals of this nature from the mid-20th century onwards. During the French colonial era, a district of Montreal existed in the French Province of Canada. During the 19th century, Americans sometimes referred to the Province of Quebec as the Province of Montreal. The Roman Catholic church also divides Canada up into ecclesiastical provinces, one of which being the Ecclesiastical Province of Montreal. During the prelude to the Confederation of Canada in the 1860s, some proposals were made to divide up Lower Canada( the current province of Quebec) into multiple provinces, the one with the most currency being to create the provinces of Montreal, Eastern Townships and Quebec. One of the earlier modern proposals for the Province of Montreal dates from the late 1960s, when it was proposed that\" Mr. Montreal\", Mayor Jean Drapeau, having many successes, and having Montreal as the economic engine of the Province of Quebec, become the premier of a new province, due to the way that Montreal tax dollars were spent outside of the region, to little benefit to Montrealers. Following the renewed rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement in the 1990s, efforts revived to create a Province of Montreal. Roopnarine Singh of Montreal founded the Movement for the 11th Province of Montreal in this era. The era before and after the referendum of 1995 also produced proposals to split the western Ottawa Valley region, the Eastern Townships of Quebec along the US border, and English- speaking parts of Montreal( such as the West Island and Westmount) into a Province of Montreal. This proposal was made by the\" partitionist movement\", which demands the right for minorities to secede from Quebec if Quebec secedes from Canada. In the wake of the referendum, prominent lawyer and then- federalist Guy Bertrand led a court fight to allow for the creation of the Province of Montreal if Quebec were to secede. West Virginia was used as an example to support the position in public.\nDocument[5](Title: Begum Jaan) Begum Jaan is a 2017 Indian Hindi period drama film.

The bombing was the deadliest act of terrorism in the United States prior to the September 11 attacks, and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in United States history. A Gulf War veteran, McVeigh sought revenge against the federal government for the 1993 Waco siege that ended in the deaths of 86 people, many of whom were children, exactly two years before the bombing, as well as the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident and American foreign policy. He hoped to inspire a revolution against the federal government, and defended the bombing as a legitimate tactic against what he saw as a tyrannical government. He was arrested shortly after the bombing and indicted on 160 state offenses and 11 federal offenses, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. He was found guilty on all counts in 1997 and sentenced to death. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001 at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. His execution was carried out in a considerably shorter time than most inmates awaiting the death penalty, as most convicts on death row in the United States spend an average of 15 years there.

The daughter of Queen Joanna and King Philip I of Castile, Mary married King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia in 1515. Their marriage was happy but short and childless. Upon her husband's death following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, Queen Mary governed Hungary as regent in the name of the new king, her brother, Ferdinand I.\nFollowing the death of their aunt Margaret in 1530, Mary was asked by her eldest brother, Emperor Charles V, to assume the governance of the Netherlands and guardianship over their nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark. As governor of the Netherlands, Mary faced riots and a difficult relationship with the Emperor. Throughout her tenure she continuously attempted to ensure peace between the Emperor and the King of France. Although she never enjoyed governing and asked for permission to resign several times, the Queen succeeded in creating a unity between the provinces, as well as in securing for them a measure of independence from both France and the Holy Roman Empire. After her final resignation, the very frail Queen moved to Castile, where she died. Having inherited the Habsburg lip and not very feminine looks, Mary was not considered physically attractive. Her portraits, letters, and comments by her contemporaries do not assign her the easy Burgundian charm possessed by her grandmother, Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and her aunt Margaret. Nevertheless, she proved to be a determined and skillful politician, as well as an enthusiastic patron of literature, music, and hunting.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Son Contento or Tadbir?": [

Born in Le\u00f3n, he was the son of Fruela of Cantabria (son of Peter of Cantabria); nephew of Alfonso I of Asturias; and a cousin of his predecessor, Fruela the Cruel. His brother, Bermudo I, later reigned as king 789 \u2013 791. Aurelius was chosen as king by the Asturian nobility after Fruela assassinated his brother and was in turn assassinated. He is believed to have been crowned in Sama. His seems to have been a relatively quiet and peaceful reign, attested by the near-absence of mention of his reign in the medieval chronicles. The only event of his reign narrated in the chronicles was a rebellion of serfs, which Aurelius put down. The location of the uprising is unknown, but it is the first recorded instance of anti-seignorial revolt in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. It is believed that, according to the custom of the times, he negotiated peace with the Muslims who dominated the lands to his south by an exchange of brides, which according to legend led to the place-name \"El Entrego\", nowadays the heart of the municipality of San Mart\u00edn del Rey Aurelio. It would appear that his principal residence and the effective capital of Asturias during his reign was the municipality of San Mart\u00edn del Rey Aurelio, then part of Langreo.

Harrison wrote the song in early 1969 at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton, where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation. The lyrics reflect his relief at the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band's business affairs. As of September 2019, it was the most streamed Beatles song in the United Kingdom, with over 50 million plays. The Beatles recorded \"Here Comes the Sun\" at London's EMI Studios in the summer of 1969. Led by Harrison's acoustic guitar, the track features Moog synthesizer, which he had introduced to the band's sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California.

Combined with his other contribution to \"Abbey RoadSomething\", it gained for Harrison the level of recognition as a songwriter that had previously been reserved for his bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Harrison played the song during many of his relatively rare live performances as a solo artist, including at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 and, with Paul Simon, during his appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1976.

These themes would be revisited by the band, notably on their second album, \"In the Wake of PoseidonPictures of a City\", with a similar mood as \"21st Century Schizoid Man\", would be followed by \"Cadence and Cascade\", another calm song, and the second album's title track also mirrors \"Epitaph\" in some aspects as well, both of which end side one.

Lucius was a son of Marcus Antonius Creticus, son of the rhetorician Marcus Antonius Orator executed by Gaius Marius' supporters in 86 BC, and Julia Antonia, a cousin of Julius Caesar. Together with his older brothers Mark Antony and Gaius Antonius, he spent his early years roaming through Rome in bad company. Plutarch refers to the untamed life of the youths and their friends, frequenting gambling houses and drinking too much. Lucius was always a strong supporter of Mark Antony. In 44 BC, the year of Antony's consulship and Julius Caesar's assassination, Lucius, as tribune of the plebs, brought forward a law authorizing Caesar to nominate the chief magistrates during his absence from Rome. After the murder of Caesar, he supported his brother Marcus. He proposed an agrarian law in favor of the people and Caesar's veterans and took part in the operations at Mutina (43 BC). In 41 BC, he was consul with Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus as his senior partner. In this year, he assisted Mark Antony's wife, Fulvia, who was anxious to recall her husband from Cleopatra's court, in the raising of an eight legion army to fight against Octavian's unpopular policies. Later, observing the bitter feelings that had been evoked by the distribution of land among the veterans of Caesar, Antonius and Fulvia changed their attitude and stood forward as the defenders of those who had suffered from its operation. Antonius marched on Rome, drove out Lepidus, and promised the people that the triumvirate would be abolished. On the approach of Octavian, he retired to Perusia in Etruria, where he was besieged by three armies, and compelled to surrender in the winter of 41 BC) The city was destroyed but his life was spared, and he was sent by Octavian to Spain as governor. Nothing is known of the circumstances or date of his death.

Bisgood was the first Somerset cricketer to score a century on debut; the second would be Harold Gimblett in 1935.

Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \"noise\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.\nDocument[5](Title: Carolyn Rodrigues) Carolyn Allison Rodrigues-Birkett (born September 16, 1973) is a Guyanese politician who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guyana from 2008 to 2015.\nDocument[6](Title: Brian Clemens) Brian Horace Clemens OBE (30 July 1931 \u2013 10 January 2015) was an English screenwriter and television producer, possibly best known for his work on \"The Avengers\" and \"The Professionals\".

Voronin was born in Sevastopol to an upper-class family, the daughter of physician Andrei Sergeyevich Voronin, who had considerable income from oil. When she was about three years old, the family moved to Yalta. The family moved again to Kharkov after the First World War began in 1914. There she attended the Kharkov Ballet School and was sent to the LV Dombrovskaya women's gymnasium, at that time a prestigious boarding school for the children of the nobility. During the 1917 Russian Revolution, the family's lifestyle collapsed as their servants fled and rooms in their mansion were confiscated.

She founded the women's section of the Tudeh( communist) party of Iran. She received a liberal education for the Iranian women of her time, and attended university later in life while living in exile. She was a linguist, fluent in Kurdish, Persian, Arabic, French, Russian, German, and English. An independent thinker, she appreciated communist theory. Later in life she said that the reason she chose to become a member of the Tudeh party was that when she decided to actively engage in the women's rights movement, the only party who was willing to accept her[ as a woman] and give her a chance to do something at that time was the Tudeh Party. Maryam chose to use the surname Firouz in her political struggles; her grandfather's name. She became known as Maryam Firouz in the political arena. She retained her legal name as Maryam Farman Farmaian with pride. She first married General army Abbassgholi Esfandiary[ son of Mohtashem Saltaneh] in a marriage arranged by her father. They had two daughters, Afsaneh and Afsar. They divorced on the death of her father. In 1949 Maryam married Noureddin Kianouri, a member and later general secretary of the Tudeh Party of Iran. In cooperation with Noureddin Kianouri, Farman Farmaian established a women's division of the Tudeh Party. Following the attempted assassination of Mohammad Reza Shah on 4 February 1949, the Tudeh party was blamed and her husband was imputed to have been one of the masterminds of the operation. She and her husband were forced into exile in 1956. She started her life in exile in the USSR and then lived in East Berlin, in the former German Democratic Republic. During her years of exile she completed her university studies and later taught French in the universities of Leipzig and Berlin. The couple returned to Iran following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the deposition of the Shah. The Tudeh party was reinstituted with Noureddin Kianouri as General Secretary.

He is widely considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, and one of Russia's most influential filmmakers. His films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory. Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's State Institute of Cinematography under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently directed his first five feature films in the Soviet Union: \"Ivan's Childhood\" (1962), \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966), \"Solaris\" (1972), \"Mirror\" (1975), and \"Stalker\" (1979). After years of creative conflict with Soviet authorities, Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad; \"Nostalghia\" (1983) and \"The Sacrifice\" (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden respectively. In 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled \"Sculpting in Time\". He died of cancer later that year. Tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the Cannes Film Festival throughout his career (including the FIPRESCI prize, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, and the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury) and winner of the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival for his debut film \"Ivan's Childhood\".

He reigned 6 to 8 years starting circa 2510 BC. The only activities firmly datable to his reign are the completion of the temple complex of the Pyramid of Menkaure and the construction of its own mastaba tomb at South Saqqara, the Mastabat al-Fir\u2019aun, \"stone bench of the pharaoh\".\nDocument[2](Title: Shepseskare) Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for \"Noble is the Soul of Ra\") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494\u20132345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\nDocument[3](Title: Sheleph) Sheleph was a son of Joktan, of the family of Shem.

Yet, even with the score providing the key elements of the music, there is considerable controversy about how to perform the works. Some of this controversy relates to the fact that this score-centric approach has led to performances that emphasize metrically strict block-rhythms (just as the music is notated in the score).\nDocument[6](Title: Bilbo Baggins) In Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film series, a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the young Bilbo is portrayed by Martin Freeman while Ian Holm reprises his role as an older Bilbo in An Unexpected Journey (2012) and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, The Rise And Rise Of Michael Rimmer or Bar 51?": [

Norton was the son of Sir Richard Norton of Rotherfield. He was knighted at Whitehall on 23 July 1603. Through his marriage in 1606 he came into possession of Southwick Park He was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1607. He built a new house on or near the site of Southwick Priory which was demolished at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1621, he was elected Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. He was elected MP for Hampshire in 1624 and for Portsmouth again in 1625. It was while Charles I was the guest of Norton at Southwick Park, that he received the news of the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham by John Felton at Portsmouth. In 1626 he served a second term as Sheriff of Hampshire and in 1628 was elected MP for Hampshire again, sitting until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Norton had joined Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet in denouncing Arminianism in the 1628- 29 parliament, and Norton was made one of the trustees for Cooper's son Anthony Ashley Cooper. He provided a home for him and his siblings at Southwick after the death of their parents and Norton chose a man with Puritan leanings named Fletcher as Cooper's tutor.

He was the sixth American vice president to die in office. Hobart was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore, and grew up in nearby Marlboro. After attending Rutgers College, Hobart read law with prominent Paterson attorney Socrates Tuttle. The two studied together, and Hobart married Tuttle's daughter Jennie. Although he rarely set foot in a courtroom, Hobart became wealthy as a corporate lawyer. Hobart served in local governmental positions, and then successfully ran for office as a Republican, serving in both the New Jersey General Assembly and the New Jersey Senate. He became Speaker of the first, and president of the latter. Hobart was a longtime party official, and New Jersey delegates went to the 1896 Republican National Convention determined to nominate the popular lawyer for vice president. Hobart's political views were similar to those of McKinley, who was the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. With New Jersey, a key state in the upcoming election, McKinley and his close adviser, future senator Mark Hanna, decided to have the convention select Hobart. The vice-presidential candidate emulated his running mate with a front porch campaign, though spending much time at the campaign's New York City office. McKinley and Hobart were elected. As vice president, Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley. Hobart's tact and good humor were valuable to the President, as in mid-1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office. Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home and broke the news to the secretary, who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington. Hobart died on November 21, 1899 of heart disease at age 55; his place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt.\nDocument[3](Title: Daughter of Julius Constantius) An unnamed daughter of Julius Constantius was the first known wife of Constantius II.\nDocument[4](Title: Julius Constantius) Julius Constantius (died September 337) was a politician of the Roman Empire and a member of the Constantinian dynasty, being a son of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and his second wife Flavia Maximiana Theodora, a younger half-brother of Emperor Constantine the Great and the father of Emperor Julian.\nDocument[5](Title: New York City) New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan.

He is best remembered for several horror films: \"Frankenstein\" (1931), \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical \"Show Boat\". He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, and many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. Whale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play \"Journey's End\" led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from \"Journey's End\" (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera. At the height of his career as a director Whale directed \"The Road Back\" (1937), a sequel to \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool. Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Temptation Of A Monk?": [

Starring Zbigniew Cybulski and Ewa Krzy\u017cewska, it completed Wajda's war films trilogy, following\" A Generation\"( 1954) and\" Kanal\"( 1956). The action of\" Ashes and Diamonds\" takes place in 1945, shortly after World War II. The main protagonist of the film, former Home Army soldier Maciek Che\u0142micki, is acting in the anti-Communist underground. Maciek receives an order to kill Szczuka, the local secretary of the Polish Workers' Party. Over time, Che\u0142micki increasingly doubts if his task is worth doing. \" Ashes and Diamonds\", although based on the novel which directly supported the postwar Communist system in Poland, was subtly modified in comparison with the source material. Wajda sympathized with the soldiers of the Polish independence underground; thus, he devoted most of the attention to Che\u0142micki. During the three- month development of\" Ashes and Diamonds\", the director made drastic changes to the baseline scenario, thanks to his assistant director Janusz Morgenstern, as well as Cybulski, who played the leading role. The film received permission from the authorities to be distributed only through Andrzejewski's intercession. The film did not receive permission to be screened at the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival. However,\" Ashes and Diamonds\" appeared at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI award. At first,\" Ashes and Diamonds\" met positive critical reception, both in Poland and worldwide. However, after the Revolutions of 1989, it was criticized for falsifying the collective memory of Polish partisans. Nevertheless, the film maintained the reputation of one of the most famous Polish motion pictures in history.\nDocument[3](Title: If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away) ``If Heaven Was n't So Far Away ''is a song written by Dallas Davidson, Rob Hatch, and Brett Jones.

The transformer was first demonstrated in 1883 at London's Royal Aquarium. At the time the term\" transformer\" had not yet been invented, so instead it was referred to as a\" secondary generator\". Although he is usually credited equally with Gaulard, Gibb's role in the invention appears to have been more that of a financial backer and businessman. Although the underlying physics of the transformer, mainly Faraday's law of induction, had been known since the 1830s, transformers became viable only after the introduction of Gaulard and Gibbs's transformer design in 1883. The breakthrough was to build an iron transformer core which could act as a magnetic circuit. At the time, their invention was seen as overcomplicated since it contained a movable armature. It caught the attention of Sir Coutts Lindsay, who used it to power the Grosvenor Gallery, which was one of the first lighting systems in Britain powered by a central generating station. In 1885 Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Miksa D\u00e9ri and K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky secured a patent on a similar design, using laminated sheets of metal to reduce eddy currents. Information on an exhibition of Gibbs and Gaulard's transformer in Turin, Italy in 1884 was published in 1885 and caught the attention of George Westinghouse. In the summer of 1885 Westinghouse bought the American rights for Gibbs and Gaulard's design and ordered that several transformers from Gibbs and Gaulard be purchased and shipped to his factory in Pittsburgh. Westinghouse then asked the engineer William Stanley, Jr. to design an electric lighting system using them. Stanley subsequently greatly improved on Gibbs and Gaulard's design and is often credited in their place. John Dixon Gibbs had his work patented under German patent no. 28947, a patent also recognized in Great Britain. The patent was disputed by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti. Following patent litigation, Gibbs and Gaulard lost the patent. Gibbs appealed the suit, taking the case all the way to the House of Lords, where he again lost. He was financially ruined in the process.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born later, The Night The Prowler or When The Gods Fall Asleep?": [

Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 \u00b0C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.\n\nQuestion: Who is younger, John Duncan Macfarlane or Andr\u00e9s Manuel Del R\u00edo?": [

The film is coloured with Indonesian mainstream as well as sidestream values, elements of classical culture and politics, and real issues encountered in teen life. The film raised censorship controversies among conservative Muslims in Indonesia, being the first Indonesian teen movie that featured a scene of a passionate kiss. The movie is known as\" Beautiful Days\" in Japan. Shortly after its success,\" What's Up with Love?\" was adapted into a sinetron( soap opera) version. In 2014, Japanese chatting application LINE released a promotional short film featuring the cast of\" What's Up with Love?\" titled\" Ada Apa dengan Cinta? 2014\" that portrays Rangga contacting Cinta via LINE after 12 years.

The film takes place 14 years after the events of the first film and tells how Cinta and Rangga are dealing with their lives after their off screen break- up before finally meeting each other again as old unresolved sparks and feelings begin to emerge from both former lovers. The film was made after the immense reception of LINE's promotional short film that featuring\" AADC\" s cast, which got many people to ask Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza to create a feature- length sequel for the beloved teen romance. As a result, the film was officially developed. The film ignores all the events in\" AADC? 2014\", such as Cinta and Rangga both having different jobs than in the short, and despite actress reprising her role in the short, she could n't appear in the feature sequel and her character was written out as having died in this film. Highly anticipated, the film was released on 28 April 2016 simultaneously in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam. The film was released to critical and commercial success.

Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods.

By 2014, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) per day and was projected to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700,000 m3) per day by 2020.
