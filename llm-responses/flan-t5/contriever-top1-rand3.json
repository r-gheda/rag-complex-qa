A semester system divides the academic year into two terms of equal length, with attendance required in both semesters to total 32 to 36 weeks of instruction. There is often an optional summer session half as long as a full semester. A trimester system divides the academic year into three terms of 14 to 16 weeks each, with attendance required in two trimesters per year, to total 28 to 32 weeks of instruction. The trimester evolved from the semester system in the 1960s and, thus, is compatible with it (i.e. it is simply a semester shortened from 16 -- 18 weeks to 14 -- 16 weeks). The spring - summer trimester may be a full trimester or may be divided into distinct spring and summer half - trimester or shorter sessions, in which classes meet double - time (or greater) to provide the same instruction that would be received in a full trimester.\nDocument[2](Title: Where's the Love (disambiguation)) \" Where's the Love\" is a 1997 song by Hanson.

He graduated from the Soviet VGIK film school in 1975 after which he started working at the Riga Film Studio. He became a director in 1979. Podnieks' first film \"Cradle\" won an award at the Dok Leipzig festival. In 1981, his film \"The Brothers Kokar\" took the first prize at the Kiev Youth Festival. In the same year, his film \"Constellation of Riflemen\" won honours in the 17th All State Festival in Leningrad and the Latvian Komsomol prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the Soviet Union. Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie \" 'Is It Easy to Be Young?\". The film with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks talked to youngsters later convicted for criminal actions. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled \"Hello, do you hear us?\". It showed civil unrest in Uzbekistan, survivors of the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, striking workers in Yaroslavl and former residents returning to Chernobyl. The first film in the series, \"Red Hot\", was awarded the Prix Italia and the Peabody Award. Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of national identity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. His \"Homeland\" was an account of folk festivals in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the attempted coup by Soviet forces in Riga. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend Andris Slapi\u0146\u0161 was killed and Gvido Zvaigzne, another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries. This was captured on video and shown as an addition to \"Homeland\" and later as an introduction for the revised version of this film. Four of his films received the Lielais Kristaps prize as the best documentary of the year. Juris Podnieks drowned on 23 June 1992 while scuba-diving in a lake in Courland.\nDocument[3](Title: The Film That Changed My Life) The Film That Changed My Life( also known as\" The Film That Changed My Life: 30 Directors on Their Epiphanies in the Dark\") is a non-fiction collection of interviews compiled by American journalist, author and film columnist Robert K.

Recorded by singers Beth Fowler, Marni Nixon and Lea Salonga, the latter two of whom provide the singing voices of Grandmother Fa and Fa Mulan, respectively, the song is a character number performed by several older Chinese women and female members of Mulan's family as they prepare the main character to be evaluated by the Matchmaker in the scene towards the beginning of the film. Songwriter Stephen Schwartz was originally enlisted to write the songs for \"Mulan\", and had written a song called \"China Doll\" intended for the scene in which Mulan prepares to meet the Matchmaker. After the songwriter resigned from \"Mulan\" in favor of writing songs for rival studio DreamWorks' \" The Prince of Egypt\" (1998) , Schwartz was ultimately replaced with Wilder and Zippel, who wrote \"Honor to Us All\" with which to replace \"China Doll\". Nixon's casting as Grandmother Fa's singing voice ultimately influenced Disney to recast the voice actress who had originally been hired to supply Grandmother Fa's speaking voice with actress June Foray due to closer similarities between Nixon's and Foray's voices. Intended to be ironic, \"Honor to Us All\" features lyrics that instruct Mulan on how to become an ideal bride by emphasizing her physical appearance, remaining obedient to her prospective husband and eventually bearing children. Parodying traditional gender roles and cultural expectations of women, \"Honor to Us All\" has been identified as an East Asian-influenced song that heavily incorporates Asian instrumentation, more-so than any other musical number in the film. The song's use of pentatonic scales and Chinese flutes also help establish the film's setting, as does referencing the Chinese tradition of praying to one's ancestors. \"Honor to Us All\" has received mixed reviews from film and music critics, who were divided over both the song's quality and intended message.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Who...?": [

Evidentialism is therefore a thesis about which beliefs are justified and which are not. For philosophers Richard Feldman and Earl Conee, evidentialism is the strongest argument for justification because it identifies the primary notion of epistemic justification. They argue that if a person's attitude towards a proposition fits their evidence, then their doxastic attitude for that proposition is epistemically justified. Feldman and Conee offer the following argument for evidentialism as an epistemic justification:( EJ) Doxastic attitude\" D\" toward proposition\" p\" is epistemically justified for\" S\" at\" t\" if and only if having\" D\" toward\" p\" fits the evidence. For Feldman and Conee a person's doxastic attitude is justified if it fits their evidence. EJ is meant to show the idea that justification is characteristically epistemic. This idea makes justification dependent on evidence. Feldman and Conee believe that because objections to EJ have become so prominent their defense for it is appropriate. The theses that object EJ are implying that epistemic justification is dependent upon the\" cognitive capacities of an individual or upon the cognitive processes or information- gatherings practices that lead to an attitude.\" For Feldman and Conee, EJ is in contrast to these theses; EJ contends that the epistemic justification for an attitude is only dependent upon evidence.\nDocument[4](Title: Frederic Villiers) Frederic Villiers( 23 April 1851 \u2013 5 April 1922), British war artist and war correspondent.

After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team's star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club's promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season. Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac 1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball- playing defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a3 8.45 million the following season. Following his arrival in England, Koscielny was regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.

Oxford was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom, a court favourite for a time, a sought-after patron of the arts, and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and court playwright, but his volatile temperament precluded him from attaining any courtly or governmental responsibility and contributed to the dissipation of his estate. Since the 1920s he has been among the most popular alternative candidates proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare's works. De Vere was the only son of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and Margery Golding. After the death of his father in 1562, he became a ward of Queen Elizabeth and was sent to live in the household of her principal advisor, Sir William Cecil. He married Cecil's daughter, Anne, with whom he had five children. De Vere was estranged from her for five years after he refused to acknowledge her first child as his. De Vere was a champion jouster and travelled widely throughout Italy and France. He was among the first to compose love poetry at the Elizabethan court, and he was praised as a playwright, though none of the plays known as his survive. A stream of dedications praised de Vere for his generous patronage of literary, religious, musical, and medical works, and he patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as musicians, tumblers, acrobats and performing animals. He fell out of favour with the Queen in the early 1580s and was exiled from court after impregnating one of her maids of honour, Anne Vavasour, which instigated violent street brawls between de Vere's retainers and her uncles. De Vere was reconciled to the Queen in 1583, but all opportunities for advancement had been lost. In 1586, the Queen granted de Vere a \u00a31,000 annuity to relieve his financial distress caused by his extravagance and selling off his income-producing lands for ready money. After his wife's death, he married Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen's maids of honour, with whom he had an heir, Henry de Vere.

On January 18, 1253, at the age of two months, he succeeded his father Henry I as king of Cyprus, with his mother, Queen Plaisance, acting as regent, and was crowned at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, later in that year. Although he had only a weaker claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, many felt that he was a better candidate( living in a Crusader state close to the Palestinian coast) than Conradin, the Hohenstaufen claimant who was also a child but absent in Europe( Hugh II was second in order of succession, right after Conradin himself, since he was the son of the only surviving son of Alice of Champagne, the second surviving daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and thus Conradin's great- grandaunt). In 1258 John of Ibelin, lord of Jaffa, and Bohemund VI of Antioch brought Hugh and Plaisance to Acre, where Hugh was set up as regent for Conradin, and Plaisance was chosen to carry out Hugh \u2019s regency while he remained underage, becoming Lord of Jerusalem. In 1261 Plaisance died and the regency of Cyprus passed to Hugh of Antioch- Lusignan, Hugh II's 25- year- old first cousin. His mother, Hugh II's younger aunt Isabella of Lusignan became acting regent of Jerusalem in Acre. Hugh II died in Nicosia in November 1267 at the age of 14 and was buried in the Dominican Church in Nicosia. He had been betrothed and was possibly married at Nicosia in 1264/ 1265 to Isabella of Ibelin( ca. 1252 \u2013 Beirut, 1282/1283 and buried there), Lady of Beirut 1264, but the marriage was never consummated. He was succeeded by Hugh of Lusignan- Antioch( son of his younger aunt Isabella) as Hugh III of Cyprus, though his heir- general was another first cousin, Hugh of Brienne( c. 1240 \u2013 1296), son of Mary of Cyprus, the eldest aunt of the deceased Hugh II. This claim fell to his son Walter V of Brienne and his descendants. They are the heirs- general of King Amalric I of Cyprus. It has often been claimed that 1266 Thomas Aquinas dedicated his work\" De regimine principum On the Government of Rulers\") to Hugh II, but in view of the strong argument by Christoph Fl\u00fceler( Rezeption und Interpretation der Aristotelischen \u201c Politica \u201d im sp\u00e4ten Mittelalter, Bochumer Studien zur Philosophie, 19( Amsterdam and Philadelphia: B.R. Gr\u00fcner, 1992), 2 v.; v.1, 23\u201329.) for redating the work to 1271 \u2013 73, it now seems likely that it was written for his successor Hugh III( 1267 \u2013 84). Later works, such as Panos Leventis'\" Twelve Times in Nicosia. Nicosia, Cyprus, 1192- 1570: Topography, Architecture and Urban Experience in a Diversified Capital City\"( Nicosia: Cyprus Research Center, 2005, pp. 49, 51) argue for the earlier dating and the work's dedication to Hugh II, based on a perceived\" formative\" understanding of Aristotelian works by Aquinas, i.e. prior to 1265.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Jo Planckaert's father?": [

Ellis is perhaps most visible as the quiet teacher/pianist for the high school kids on \"Glee\", the Fox television show for which he is part of creator Ryan Murphy's musical production team. Ellis grew up in the Boston area, attending Lexington High School. One of his teachers introduced him to the music program at Boston's Berklee College of Music, where Ellis would study music composition starting in the late 1970s, earning his degree between gigs over the next fifteen years. Ellis had a long association with the continuously evolving Off-Broadway satirical revue \" Forbidden Broadway'where he met his wife, comedienne Eydie Alyson. His Brad Ellis Little Big Band has released recordings, as produced by Bruce Kimmel. Ellis arranged, orchestrated and conducted members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for their 2006 album \"Unexpected Dreams: Songs from the Stars\", in support of the Philharmonic's \"Music Matters\" fund for music education. The album featured performances by TV and film stars including Victor Garber, Lucy Lawless, and Scarlett Johansson. In 2006 Ellis orchestrated and arranged the world premiere of Billy Joel's \"Waltz Variations no.2 op.5\", performed by Christoph Eschenbach and the Philadelphia Orchestra, for the 151st Anniversary Gala celebration of Philadelphia's Academy of Music. He created, with Jason Alexander, \"Seven Broadway Shows in 7 Minutes\". This witty medley was performed by Alexander with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, when the orchestra inducted its long-time conductor John Mauceri into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame in 2007. Ellis is the composer of the original music for the 2009 Off Broadway run of \"The Tin Pan Alley Rag\", which told the story of a fictional meeting between musical greats Scott Joplin and Irving Berlin. Ellis has composed or played piano for many TV shows and films, including \"Gilmore Girls\" (in the Season 5 episode \"Jews and Chinese Food\" the Season 7 episode \" Unto the Breach\"), and original ragtime cues Gilmore Girl \u2019s last episode of the last season. \"Close to HomeDelovely\" Bunheads, and the DVD special features for \"Beauty and the Beast. In 2009, Ellis joined the production team creating the new television series \"Glee\". Ellis joined the team as a musical director and vocal coach, but received additional duties as an on-screen, virtually non-speaking character providing piano accompaniment to the glee club. From the pilot episode, Ellis' name appears in the technical credits rather than the character credits of his on-screen episodes. The enigmatic role has led to Ellis being featured in interviews with \"People\" magazine, CNN.com, National Public Radio and Entertainment Weekly. In 2009, Ellis was part of the team that created the music and lyrics for the opening number for 81st Academy Awards telecast, as performed by Oscar host Hugh Jackman.

He reigned jointly with his young son Diadumenianus. Macrinus was by origin a Berber from Mauretania Caesariensis. A member of the equestrian class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the senatorial class and was the first emperor from Mauretania. Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor Caracalla as a praetorian prefect and dealt with Rome's civil affairs. He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor. Macrinus was proclaimed emperor of Rome by 11 April 217 while in the eastern provinces of the empire and was subsequently confirmed as such by the Senate; however, for the duration of his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. His predecessor's policies had left Rome's coffers empty and the empire at war with several kingdoms, including Parthia, Armenia and Dacia. As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic stability to Rome. While Macrinus' diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military. Caracalla's aunt Julia Maesa took advantage of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, Elagabalus, recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in Chalcedon and later executed in Cappadocia. He sent his son to the care of Artabanus V of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.\nDocument[2](Title: Stanley River (Tasman)) The Stanley River is a river of the Tasman Region of New Zealand's South Island.

Murray had planned to travel to Sydney, to join the Redfern All Blacks Rugby League team's tour of New Zealand when he was detained. Police claimed that they found Murray hanging in his cell at the Wee Waa Police Station around 3:30 pm, and argued that he committed suicide, although this occurred prior to the majority of Aboriginal deaths in custody which were later examined in the 1987 Royal Commission. He was 21 years old at the time. Eddie Murray's parents, Leila Jane( n\u00e9e Button) and Arthur Edward Murray remained unconvinced that their son's death was a suicide, and fought for a more extensive investigation into Murray's death. Murray's death has helped to draw attention to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Murray's case has drawn the attention of several investigations, including the Muirhead Royal Commission, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board Report on Street offences, and his case was one of the first to be investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988. In 1997, Murray's body was exhumed and re-autopsied, revealing a previously undetected smashed sternum, and a forensic pathologist determined that the injury had most likely occurred immediately prior to his death. Despite this, the details of his death remain a mystery, and still no one has been officially implicated in his death. This has been to the dissatisfaction of Murray's family, who have called for a more extensive inquiry.\nDocument[3](Title: Remember Me?

The term refers to reports of luminescent, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, the phenomenon lasts considerably longer than the split- second flash of a lightning bolt. Two reports from the nineteenth century say that the ball eventually explodes, leaving behind an odor of sulfur. The actual existence of lightning ball phenomena is not proven, but they appear in a variety of accounts over the centuries. Until the 1960s, most scientists treated reports of ball lightning skeptically, despite numerous accounts from around the world. Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear. Scientists have proposed many hypotheses about ball lightning over the centuries. Scientific data on natural ball- lightning remains scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence depends on reported public sightings, which have produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Owing to inconsistencies and to the lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning remains unknown. The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball- lightning event was published in January 2014, and included a video at high frame- rate.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died earlier, The Love Charm or The Constant Woman?": [

He was the father of Sir Leander Starr Jameson, South African statesman and prime minister, and the nephew of Professor Robert Jameson of the University of Edinburgh. Born in Edinburgh in 1805, Robert William was the son of Thomas Jameson, a wealthy shipowner, merchant and burgess of the city of Edinburgh, as recorded in Colvin, Vol. 1: 1- 2( 1922). Colvin writes of Robert William's father and grandfather, both of whom were named Thomas Jameson, that:\" These Jamesons came, so the tradition goes, from the Shetland Islands; and both their origin and their crest, a ship in full sail, with\" Sine Metu\" for motto, suggest that they once followed a seafaring life. But they had been long settled in Leith and Edinburgh.\" ( Colvin, 1922, Vol. 1:1). In 1835 Robert William Jameson married Christian Pringle, daughter of Major- General Pringle of Symington and his wife Christian Watson. The Jamesons had eleven children, of whom Leander Starr was the youngest, born on 9 February 1853. Having first pursued a career as a Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, Robert William's interest in journalism was recognised by his Whig friend and patron the Earl of Stair, who in 1854 made him Editor of the\" Wigtownshire Free Press\", the headquarters of which was based in Stranraer, to which the family moved from Edinburgh, remaining there until 1860. Robert William was a radical and free thinker, author of the dramatic poem\" Nimrod\", published in 1848 and of the play\" Timolean\", a tragedy in five acts, published and performed at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh in 1852. \" Timolean\", inspired by liberal anti-slavery views of the era, was popular with audiences and ran to a second edition within the first year of publication. In 1854 Jameson published the novel\" The Curse of Gold\". Writing for\" The Scotsman\" in 1922, W. Forbes Gray observed of Robert William Jameson that:\" There was probably no better known man in Edinburgh in the earlier part of the last century than Robert William Jameson, W.S., the father of the South African statesman whose biography is reviewed in your columns to- day. When the agitation for Parliamentary and municipal reform was at its height, Jameson, who was a sturdy Radical and a violent opponent of the Corn Law, ranged himself alongside of Adam Black, and was able as well as indefatigable in his advocacy of the policy of the' clean slate'. Lord Chancellor Campbell considered Jameson the best hustings speaker he ever heard.

The marriage of Isabella and Humphrey was celebrated in Kerak Castle in autumn 1183. Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria, laid siege to the fortress during the wedding, but Baldwin IV forced him to lift the siege. Baldwin IV, who suffered from lepromatous leprosy, had made his nephew (the only son of his sister, Sybilla by her first husband), Baldwin V, his heir and co-ruler, to prevent Sybilla's second husband, Guy of Lusignan, from mounting the throne. The High Court of Jerusalem stipulated that a committee of Western European rulers was entitled to choose between Sybilla and Isabella to succeed Baldwin V if he died before reaching the age of majority, but Sybilla and Guy of Lusignan were crowned soon after Baldwin V died in 1185.

He reigned from 180 to 164 BC and from 163 to 145 BC. The eldest son of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I of Egypt, he came to the throne as a very young child in 180 BC and the kingdom was governed by regents: his mother until her death in 178 or 177 BC and then two of her associates, Eulaeus and Lenaeus until 169 BC. From 170 BC, his sister-wife Cleopatra II and his younger brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes were co-rulers alongside him. Ptolemy VI's reign was characterised by external conflict with the Seleucid empire over Syria and by internal conflict with his younger brother for control of the Ptolemaic monarchy. In the Sixth Syrian War (170-168 BC), the Ptolemaic forces were utterly defeated and Egypt was twice invaded by Seleucid armies. His attempts to negotiate an end to this conflict exacerbated the conflict with his brother. Though he managed to collaborate with his brother for long enough to secure peace and re-establish order within Egypt, Ptolemy VIII succeeded in expelling Ptolemy VI from Egypt in 164 BC. The people of Alexandria turned against Ptolemy VIII and invited Ptolemy VI back to the throne in 163 BC. In this second reign he was much more successful in both conflicts. He banished his brother to Cyrenaica and repeatedly prevented him from using that as a springboard to taking Cyprus, despite substantial Roman intervention in his brother's favour. By supporting a series of rival claimants for the Seleucid throne, Ptolemy VI helped instigate a civil war in the Seleucid realm, which would continue for generations and eventually consume the Seleucid dynasty. In 145 BC, Ptolemy invaded Seleucid Syria and won a total victory at the Battle of the Oenoparus, which left him in charge of both the Seleucid and Ptolemaic realms. However, injuries that he sustained in the battle led to his death three days later. The gains from the war were almost immediately lost and his brother Ptolemy VIII returned to power.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of Samir Rifai's father?": [

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.\nDocument[2](Title: Walk, Don't Run) Walk, Do n't Run is a 1966 Technicolor comedy film directed by Charles Walters and starring Cary Grant in his final film role, Samantha Eggar, and Jim Hutton.

The first known book on the`` leaf'' game was called the Yezi Gexi and allegedly written by a Tang woman. It received commentary by writers of subsequent dynasties. The Song dynasty (960 -- 1279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007 -- 1072) asserts that the ``leaf ''game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated its invention with the development of printed sheets as a writing medium.

She was the daughter of Emperor Galerius and his first wife, whose name is unknown. She married Maxentius around 293 (the exact date is unknown) in what was likely an attempt to forge an alliance between the families of Galerius and Maxentius' father Maximian, himself Emperor in the West. She bore two sons: the eldest, Valerius Romulus, was born c. 295; the other son's name is not recorded, but might be Aurelius Valerius, who was executed in 312. As an emperor's daughter, she was entitled \"nobilissima femina\". Her husband was acclaimed emperor in October 306 against the wishes of Valeria Maximilla's father, who tried to overthrow the usurper in 307 but without success. Maxentius remained the ruler of Rome, Italy and Africa until 312, when Constantine I invaded Italy. Valeria and her husband were together before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, when she disappears from the historical record. Her fate is unknown. Their son, Romulus, died in 309\nValeria Maximilla's portrait does not appear on any of the coinage issued under Maxentius, but she may have been depicted on a defaced sculpture now housed in the Capitoline Museums.

Maximilla may be the nameless queen who appears in the hagiography of St. Catherine of Alexandria by Jacobus de Voragine (one of the fantastic stories in the \"Golden Legend\"). In this story, the queen converted to Christianity after meeting with Catherine, and the both of them were then tortured and executed by Maxentius, depicted here as a persecutor of Christians.\nDocument[2](Title: Parisienne (film)) Parisienne  is a 2015 French drama film directed by Danielle Arbid.

Over the years, he has participated in investigative field work, mainly in Denmark and Greece, but also other countries [Afghanistan, Cambodia and Turkey], always adopting a highly systematic and methodical approach and producing widely acclaimed drawings of his finds. Erik Hansen was only very young, only five years old, when he lost his parents and was raised by his aunt Karen and\nuncle Jeppe in the villa behind the bishop's palace in Ribe in southwest Jutland. As a maths student from Ribe Cathedral School and timber apprentice from the city technical school, he joined the University of Copenhagen to study mathematics, physics and chemistry. He also completed the preparatory examination in philosophy course. He quickly realized that he should follow the footsteps of his father and become an architect. After one year he changed to School of Architecture, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, where he studied in Buildings and architectural history at Professor Mogens Koch's department where his artisanal interest and knowledge in carpentry was relevant. Architect Otto von Sprechelsen was one of Erik's best friends. Throughout his working life, Erik undertook the survey and documentation of building culture and monuments with careful measurements; the aim was to understand the monument and its construction technology, building and organizational factors underlying. His role model in this artisanal approach to conservation work was the Danish architect-archaeologist Ejnar Dyggve. Erik Hansen \"sterile\" surveying and his incomprehensible stringent lines in ink, which in all their simplicity, contained the necessary information for an understanding of the present monuments structural state formed school not only in Denmark but in many other countries where he was sent on mission by UNESCO to Afghanistan and Cambodia. Erik Hansen's international students in the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture were from Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greece, Mexico and other Scandinavian countries. His stay in Greece was one of the more durable and linked to Apollo's sanctuary in Delphi. A few times he stayed there for several years, other times he visited the site every six months. The first major work of the Ecole Francaise d'Ath\u00e8nes was examining Siphniernes famous Treasury in Delphi in the years 1955-1965, a large-scale topographic atlas of the sanctuary, which was completed in 1968, and finally his outstanding research in Apollo's Temple and its reconstruction after a landslide in 373 [BC]. His unusually precise measurements of each stone after another, in conjunction with construction contracts with named contractors was carved in stone, was released in French school big series Fouilles the Delphes, in three much attractive Volumes in 2010. In the many years living abroad he was accompanied by his Swedish wife Inger, called Kickan, who was pharmacist by education and a skilled photographer. Kickan was not just Erik's wife, she continued to be his tireless friend and engaged in everything he was dealing with. They both engaged with locals and wrote about what they saw and experienced. In Delphi they knew most of the inhabitants, and one was reminded about when travelling to Delphi, as one would carry a bag full of letters to their friends. Kickan and Erik also had their own traditions in Greece when the moon was full. They went out to the temple in dark and sat out there in silence, while the moon slowly rose above the deep valley of Delphi. Admittedly it was strictly forbidden. Erik lost Kickan in 2008 and lived alone for the remaining eight years of his life. Along with his work in UNESCO in training young professionals for and restoration of monuments in Afghanistan, for example the Ghurid Portal of the Friday Mosque of Herat in Afghanistan [Kabul and Herat, 1964-5], then Cambodia [Phnom Kulen,1968], and Korea, he also was deeply engaged in the difficult restoration works of the beautiful \"Marmorbro\" [the marble bridge] of Frederiksholms Channel in Copenhagen and its portals in the years 1977-1982. Also from this work there are stacks of upscale drawings produced in his hand-drawn lines that Akademir\u00e5det celebrated in 1977 awarding him Eckersberg medal. Also in France he in 1987 revered Prix Mendel, Academie des Inscriptions and Belles Lettres. Subsequently, in 2010, he was awarded the distinguished C. F. Hansen Medal for work with Siphniernes Treasury. Finally, his own residence, a city house built in 1725 in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, was an example of the simple building well preserved and maintained a citizen's house in which he lived with his wife Inger and their close friendship and entertained his colleagues, friends and students (national and internationals). Erik Hansen's motto: \" Well begun is half done - but well completed is only half started\", summarizes his fine distinctive way of life.\nDocument[2](Title: Sancho Ram\u00edrez, Count of Ribagorza) Sancho Ram\u00edrez (before 10431105/November 1110) was an illegitimate son of King Ramiro I of Aragon and Amu\u00f1a, the firstborn and brother of his namesake who would inherit the throne and reign as Sancho Ram\u00edrez.\nDocument[3](Title: Hans Wunderlich) Hans Wunderlich( 18 June 1899- 26 December 1977) was a German journalist and politician of the SDP.

He founded the Flavian dynasty that ruled the Empire for 27 years. Vespasian was the first emperor who hailed from an equestrian family, and only rose into the senatorial rank as the first member of his family later in his lifetime. Vespasian's renown came from his military success; he was legate of Legio II Augusta during the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 and subjugated Judaea during the Jewish rebellion of 66. While Vespasian besieged Jerusalem during the Jewish rebellion, emperor Nero committed suicide and plunged Rome into a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. After Galba and Otho perished in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in April 69. The Roman legions of Roman Egypt and Judaea reacted by declaring Vespasian, their commander, emperor on 1 July 69. In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with Mucianus, the governor of Syria, and Primus, a general in Pannonia, leaving his son Titus to command the besieging forces at Jerusalem. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian took control of Egypt. On 20 December 69, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the Senate. Little information survives about the government during Vespasian's ten-year rule. He reformed the financial system of Rome after the campaign against Judaea ended successfully, and initiated several ambitious construction projects, including the building of the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known today as the Roman Colosseum. Through his general Agricola, Vespasian increased imperial expansion in Britain. After his death in 79, he was succeeded by his eldest son Titus, thus becoming the first Roman emperor to be directly succeeded by his own natural son and establishing the Flavian dynasty.\nDocument[4](Title: Merovo) Merovo is a village in the municipality of \u017delino, Republic of Macedonia.\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the performer of song Lolita (Leah Labelle Song)?": [

He was born in Brignoles, into an artistic family that produced fourteen painters over six generations. His grandfather Georges Parrocel (1540- ca. 1614) (no surviving works) and his father Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1595\u20131660) were both painters. One badly restored painting of Bath\u00e9lemy survives in the church of Saint-Sauveur in Brignoles, France. His brothers Jean Barth\u00e9lemy Parrocel (1631\u20131653) (no surviving works) and Louis Parrocel (1634\u20131694) also became painters. He was soon noticed He was only thirteen years old when his father died in 1660. His elder brother Louis, who was already established as a painter in the Languedoc, took him under his care and gave him a training as painter. Three years later he ran away from his brother's house to Marseilles. His talent as a painter became soon noticed and he got a commission for a number of paintings with scenes of the life of Saint Anthony of Padua for the church Saint-Martin. But he only executed two of them. it is also possible that he painted them during his second stay in the Provence. He left for Paris and stayed there for four years, perfecting his skills. He then returned to the Provence and continued his journey to Italy, where he would stay for eight years. In Rome he became the pupil of Jacques Courtois, a famous painter of battle scenes who was also known als \"le Bourguignon\" or \"il Borgognone\". He also studied the works of Salvator Rosa, an unorthodox proto-Romantic painter. Joseph Parrocel worked with him in his workshop and was thoroughly influenced by him, even if he gave his style later a more French touch. Parrocel then started a journey through Italy and finally arrived in Venice. He was planning to settle in this town but after eight brigands had attempted to murder him on the Rialto Bridge, he left Italy in disgust. He settled in Paris in 1675 and earned himself a reputation. He was accepted as an elected member at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 29 February 1676 and he became an academician on 14 November 1676 with his admission piece \"Siege of Maastricht\". In 1703 he became a councillor at the Academy. As a member of the Academy, he would obtain royal commissions. However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly and the Palace of Versailles. During his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings. He died, aged 57, in Paris. He is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also landscapes, historical pieces and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the H\u00f4tel de Soubise and the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of the \"f\u00eates galantes\" of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes. His differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours. During his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University). Joseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690\u20131774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688\u20131752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667\u20131722) and Pierre (1670\u20131739), who both became painters and engravers.

The Italian word he used for \"experiment\" was esperienza. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of 'Pythagoras' hammers' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded \"experience and demonstration\" as the sine qua non of valid rational enquiry.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, Retalhos Da Vida De Um M\u00e9dico or The Shooting?": [

After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. Issued at the start of the Great Depression, the records did not sell and did not lead to national recognition. Locally, House remained popular, and in the 1930s, together with Patton's associate Willie Brown, he was the leading musician of Coahoma County. There he was a formative influence on Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. In 1941 and 1942, House and the members of his band were recorded by Alan Lomax and John W. Work for the Library of Congress and Fisk University. The following year, he left the Delta for Rochester, New York, and gave up music. In 1964, a group of young record collectors discovered House, whom they knew of from his records issued by Paramount and by the Library of Congress. With their encouragement, he relearned his repertoire and established a career as an entertainer, performing for young, mostly white audiences in coffeehouses, at folk festivals and on concert tours during the American folk music revival, billed as a \"folk blues\" singer. He recorded several albums, and some informally taped concerts have also been issued as albums. House died in 1988.

The youngest son of Joseph Smith and Emma Hale Smith, he was an influential missionary and leader in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). He was born approximately five months after the murder of his father. Joseph told Emma before he died what the child's name should be. Beginning in December 1847, he was raised by his mother and her second husband, Lewis C. Bidamon. Smith was a highly effective missionary for the RLDS Church. From 1865 to 1873, he conducted missionary trips throughout the Midwest, Utah Territory, and California, debating preachers of different theologies, including representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). From 1873 to 1885, Smith was a counselor to his brother Joseph Smith III in the First Presidency of the RLDS Church. He was also the father of Elbert A. Smith, who was a member of the First Presidency and a Presiding Patriarch in the RLDS Church. Smith was called the \"Sweet Singer of Israel\" because many who knew him, who heard him sing, and joined him in song, stated that he was the most inspiring singer of God they had encountered. The Joseph Smith Historic Site, maintained by the Community of Christ, houses Smith's original paintings of Nauvoo, Illinois. In a 1998 biography of Smith, \"From Mission to Madness: Last Son of the Mormon Prophet\", author Valeen Tippetts Avery describes Smith's mental deterioration, starting with a probable breakdown early in 1870 and ending with his 1904 death in the Northern Illinois Hospital and Asylum for the Insane in Elgin, Illinois. In an 1869 letter to his mother, Emma Smith, at age 24, Smith wrote:\nMother I must tell you ... I feel very sad and the tears run out of my eyes all the time and I don't know why. ... strive as I will my heart sinks like lead. ... I must tell someone my troubles. Smith was confined in the institution for 27 years. Avery's book draws on a large body of Smith's correspondence and poetry to examine both his personality and his emotional state.\nDocument[4](Title: Urszula Augustyniak) Urszula Augustyniak( born 1950) is a Polish historian and academic, who specializes in cultural history of the early modern period.

Harrison wrote the song in 1970, midway through the recording sessions for \"All Things Must Pass\", and recorded it in Los Angeles the following year while organising the Concert for Bangladesh. The composition was inspired by the deteriorating condition of his mother, Louise, before she succumbed to cancer in July 1970, and by Harrison's feelings of helplessness as he visited her in hospital in the north of England. Given the subject matter, \"Deep Blue\" also served to convey the suffering endured by the millions of refugees from war-torn Bangladesh in 1971, as sickness and disease became widespread among their makeshift camps in northern India. Following Harrison's work with American guitarist David Bromberg, \"Deep Blue\" features sparse instrumentation in the folk-blues style. It includes one of Harrison's first uses of dobro on a recording. The song proved popular on US radio and was listed with the A-side when \"Bangla Desh\" peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Well regarded by music critics and commentators, \"Deep Blue\" was out of print since the 1980s and gained a reputation as an overlooked B-side.

When Russian-born migrant, Sidney Myer, came to Australia in 1899 he formed the Myer retail group with his brother, Elcon Myer. In 1900, they opened the first Myer department store, in Bendigo, Victoria. Since then, the Myer retail group has grown to be Australia's largest retailer. Both, Myer and David Jones, are up-market chains, offering a wide variety of products from mid-range names to luxury brands.

He is remembered chiefly for his contributions to powered flight. In 1903\u20131904 Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles fitted with single-cylinder Peugeot Fr\u00e8res engines to build the world's first air-cooled radial engine, a three-cylinder engine by utilizing Peugeot Fr\u00e8res cylinders and -heads in a home-cast engine block. The initial engine proved soon too weak and homemade cylinders with greater volume were fitted on an even bigger block which eventually brought him into the air. The original engine wasn't abandoned but saved for later use, which eventually happened when he had a flirt with helicopters: The helicopter experiments are known and photographically documented, but late in the century a down-scaled model of his helicopter was found deep in storage and it had a relatively small three-cylinder radial engine fitted which is considered being reuse of his original engine, hence the first functioning radial engine still exists and is displayed at the technology museum of Elsinore (Helsing\u00f6r) where it is started up on a daily basis! The know-how from the three-cylinder was used as the basis for a yet more powerful five-cylinder model in 1907. This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free-flight hops as mentioned below. In 1905, he constructed a monoplane, and in the following year a \"semi-biplane\". In this latter machine, he made a tethered flight on 12 September 1906. Ellehammer's later inventions included a successful triplane and helicopter. His helicopter was a coaxial machine. A famous photo shows it hovering in 1914, though there is no evidence that it was successful in achieving horizontal flight. Ellehammer later studied a disc-rotor configuration - a compound helicopter with coaxial blades that extended from the hub for hover, and retracted for high speed vertical flight. Although a wind tunnel model was constructed, there's no evidence that anything more was studied. The initial experiments was done on a circular track attached to a central pole and constructed on a small island quite distant from Copenhagen where he lived by his workshop construction motorcycles and numerous devices. Once experiencing the first short lift offs he found time had come to move flight experiments close to Copenhagen. However with the workshop not located to the given 'airstrips' used he was forced to incorporate a folding wing for collapsing his second aircraft during transport out of town. As the first design was quite kite-like with the pilot and engine hanging separately to balance the aircraft, Ellehammer invented the UL-type motorised hang glider and the detail of foldable wings was probably decades prior to any other as the contemporary aircraft was rigid boxkite like biplanes. In 1986, Ellehammer was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.\nDocument[3](Title: Fast Car (Namie Amuro song)) \"Fast Car\" is a song by Namie Amuro.

The dialogue excerpted is from two conversations, one about a fight between two groups of young men and another about the abolition of the death penalty. The lyrics of the song seem to be about a man who has gone through his life having lots of sex, but not 'slowing down' to embrace romance with one person. The lyric 'He'll \"do\" but never be \"done to\", as well as the usual crude sexual imagery common to Morrissey songs suggests the man refuses to let his lovers penetrate his emotional self. \" Well it's the normal thing to do\"; some men don't believe emotional intimacy is needed or something in their comfort zone so they have only shallow relationships.

Later he held a similar position at Tours, and there he attracted the attention of the duc de Choiseul, who invited him to visit him at Chanteloup. Hauterive there came into contact with noblemen who visited the duke. One of these, the comte de Choiseul-Gouffier, took Hauterive with him on his appointment as ambassador to Constantinople in 1784. Hauterive was enriched for a time by his marriage with a widow, Madame de Marchais, but was ruined by the French Revolution. In 1790, he applied for and received the post of consul at New York. Under the Consulate, however, he was accused of embezzlement and recalled. Although the charge was proven to be false, he was not reinstated. In 1798, after trying his hand at farming in America, Hauterive was appointed to a post in the French foreign office. In this capacity he made a sensation by his \"De l'\u00e9tat de la France, \u00e0 la fin de l'an VIII\" (1800), which he had been commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte to draw up, as a manifesto to foreign nations, after the \"coup d'etat\" of the 18th Brumaire. This won him the confidence of Bonaparte, and he was henceforth employed in drawing up many of the more important documents. In 1805 he was made a councillor of state and member of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, and between 1805 and 1813 he was more than once temporarily minister of foreign affairs. He attempted, though in vain, to use his influence to moderate Napoleon's policy, especially in the matter of Spain and the treatment of the pope. In 1805, a difference of opinion with Talleyrand on the question of the Austrian alliance, which Hauterive favored, led to his withdrawal from the political side of the ministry of foreign affairs, and he was appointed keeper of the archives of the same department. In this capacity he did very useful work, and after the Restoration continued in this post at the request of the duc de Richelieu, his work being recognized by his election as a member of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1820. He died in Paris on 28 July 1830.\nDocument[3](Title: The Arockalypse) The Arockalypse is the third studio album by Finnish heavy metal band Lordi.

It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood. During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence. Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost. In the second step, platelet plug formation, platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall. The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting. Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a ``molecular glue ''. Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process. They allow for the creation of the`` platelet plug'' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured. Within seconds of a blood vessel's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface. It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound. After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin.

Eleanor was Queen of Denmark by marriage to Valdemar the Young, son of Valdemar II, in 1229.

The wedding took place in Ribe on 24 June 1229, and the next day Eleanor received southern half of the island Funen as a wedding present from her husband. Even though she was junior queen, she was the only queen since her aunt had died eight years prior and her father-in-law had not remarried. Only two years later Eleanor died in childbirth on the 28 August 1231, and three months later her husband was killed by an accidental shot. When examining Eleanor's grave in Ringsted Church, it was discovered that her skeleton showed traces of cancer of the bones, which probably was contributory to her death. At the foot piece of Eleanor's grave was a leaden coffin, which contained the bones of a child about 6 months old, already sickly and scrofulous from birth.

He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 23 Chevrolet Camaro for GMS Racing. He won the 1988 Winston Cup Championship and garnered 44 wins in that series, including two Daytona 500 victories in 1985 and 1987, three Southern 500 victories in 1985, 1988, and 1994, one Winston 500 victory in 1985, one Brickyard 400 victory in 2002, one \"The Winston All-Star Race\" (non-points race) win in 1986, and a record four consecutive wins at Michigan International Speedway between 1985 and 1986 (7 wins overall at Michigan, the most at any one racetrack in his career). He holds the track record for fastest qualifying speed at Talladega at and Daytona International Speedway at , both of which were set in 1987; the mark at Talladega is the fastest qualifying speed for any NASCAR race ever. With the current usage of restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega beginning since 1988, it is highly unlikely that these two qualifying speed records will ever be topped again. In 1985, Elliott made history by winning the first ever Winston Million: A million dollar bonus to any driver that could win three out of the four crown jewel races of NASCAR: The Daytona 500 at Daytona, the Winston 500 at Talladega, the World 600 at Charlotte, and the Southern 500 at Darlington. In a year dominated by Elliott, Bill went on to win 11 races (with 4 \"season sweeps\": Atlanta, Pocono, Michigan, and Darlington) and 11 poles, with three of those 11 wins being in the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, and the Southern 500, earning Bill the \"Winston Million Dollar Bonus\" and earning him the nickname \"Million Dollar Bill\". Elliott won NASCAR's Most Popular Driver Award a record 16 times (1984-1988, 1991-2000, 2002). He withdrew his name from the ballot for that award after winning it in 2002. In 2005, the Georgia State Legislature declared October 8 as Bill Elliott Day in the state of Georgia.

He inspired the fictional character John Brooke in his sister-in-law Louisa May Alcott's best known novels. John Bridge Pratt was born in Boston on June 16, 1833, the second child of Minot Pratt and his wife Maria Jones Bridge Pratt. The Pratt family lived at Brook Farm from 1841 to 1845, after which they moved to Concord, Massachusetts. As a member of the Concord Dramatic Union, John Pratt fell in love with Louisa's elder sister Anna Alcott Pratt, reportedly during a production of \"The Loan of a Lover\". The two were married in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, on May 23, 1860. They had two sons, Frederick Alcott Pratt (1863-1925) and John Sewall Pratt (1865-1923), who were the models for Demi and Daisy Brooke in the Little Women trilogy. After a brief illness, John Pratt died on November 27, 1870 in Maplewood (part of Malden, Massachusetts), where he and Anna were living. He was buried in an extension behind the Alcott lot in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord on Author's Ridge, and Anna was eventually interred beside him. John Bridge Pratt's life became the basis for the character of John Brooke in Alcott's Little Women and Little Men, with both his wedding and early death becoming important events in the story lines. In fact, Pratt's unexpected death in 1870 had prompted Louisa May Alcott, who was staying in Rome at the time, to write \"Little Men\" (published 1871) in order to provide financial security for the widowed Anna and her sons. His younger son, John Sewall Pratt, took Alcott as his surname when he was adopted by his Aunt Louisa near the end of her life. He was also buried in the Alcott lot in Sleepy Hollow when he died in 1923. John and Anna's elder son, Frederick Alcott Pratt, married Jessica Cate, with whom he had five children before his death in 1910 in Chelsea, Massachusetts.\nDocument[4](Title: Berit Nesheim) Berit Nesheim( born 28 January 1945) is a Norwegian film director.

After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and David Talbot also discovered that Campbell had died of a heart attack in 1962, six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy. In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias. He then took his identifications to the Los Angeles Police Department whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two Bulova sales managers attending the company's convention in the Ambassador. O'Sullivan stood by his allegations stating that the Bulova watch company was a \"well-known CIA cover\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?": [

In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty. They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990. In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors's degrees awarded. At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \"white\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\" Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.\n\nQuestion: Where does Kitty Dukakis's husband work at?": [

Among his portraits are those of Voltaire, Mademoiselle Clairon, Cr\u00e9billon, and Stanislaus, King of Poland. He wrote accounts of the lives and works of Leonardo da Vinci and Nicolas Poussin; a \"Guide des Amateurs de Tableaux pour les Ecoles allemande, flamande et hollandaise,\" 1818; and other works relative to painting, in which he displayed much knowledge and judgment. He was married to the Polish artist, Anna Rajecka. It is not known if they had any children.

His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), \"Danse macabre\" (1874), the opera \"Samson and Delilah\" (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\"Organ\") Symphony (1886) and \"The Carnival of the Animals\" (1886). Saint-Sa\u00ebns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Sa\u00ebns held only one teaching post, at the \u00c9cole de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Faur\u00e9, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, whom they revered as a genius.\nDocument[4](Title: Gull Lake Airport) Gull Lake Airport,, is located south of Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nQuestion: Where was the wife of Pierre-Marie Gault De Saint-Germain born?": [

Her co-worker, Oscar, brings his partner along who, not knowing that Pam is standing behind him, criticizes her work by proclaiming that ``real art requires courage. ''Oscar then goes on to say that courage is n't one of Pam's strong points. Affected by this statement, Pam tells the documentary crew that she is going to be more honest, culminating in a dramatic coal walk during the next - to - last episode of the season,`` Beach Games'', and a seemingly sincere speech to Jim in front of the entire office about their relationship. Michael also comes to the art show and reveals his erratically kind heart and loyalty by buying, framing and hanging Pam's drawing of the Dunder Mifflin building in the office. In the season finale, ``The Job, ''she leaves a friendly note in Jim's briefcase and an old memento depicting the 'gold medal' yogurt lid from the Office Olympics, which he sees during an interview for a job at Corporate in New York City. While he is asked how he`` would function here in New York'', Jim is shown to have his mind back in Scranton, still distracted by the thought of Pam. Jim withdraws his name from consideration and drives back to the office, where he interrupts a talking head Pam is doing for the documentary crew by asking her out for dinner.

The parish was established in 1867. The original sanctuary and current building were designed by the Rev. Frederick B. Scheetz and completed in 1884. The building is a rare example of an extant wood framed Carpenter Gothic church in the state of Missouri. The interior walls and vaulted ceilings are covered with narrow strips of wood paneling set diagonally on the walls and horizontally on the ceiling. A trio of stained glass windows is set above the wooden altar in the apse at the north end of the transept. The church has received few if any alterations since it was built in 1884. An early description of the newly built church would be accurate today:\" The church is frame, 40 feet by 24, with a porch in front 8 by 10 feet, with a bell tower extending above the roof. It is strongly and well built, with a solid stone foundation, which is so high in the rear of the church as to give room for a cellar for wood. The interior is ceiled throughout with narrow stuff put on diagonally, the timbers above do not show.\"' St. Paul's Episcopal Church embodies a distinctive; type of' vernacular' adaptation to the earlier Gothic Revival style important in church construction. Economic exigencies as well as available materials quite probably limited this Midwestern frame structure to a simple relatively small derivative of the more expansive models constructed in the eastern United States. The simple yet elegant form and decorative features of St. Paul's reflect the Midwestern 19th century philosophy of spiritual beliefs constrained by the realities of the time and place. The continuity in the structure can easily be interpreted to reflect the continuity in the religious community which began and still maintains this impressive building. St. Paul's Episcopal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 9, 1985.\n\nQuestion: Who is Tekle Haymanot Ii's paternal grandfather?": [

Although the Witch Fire was individually smaller than the Zaca Fire of 2007( which burned at least), burning acres alone, after merging with the Poomacha and McCoy Fires, the Witch \u2013 Guejito \u2013 Poomacha Complex Fire had a total burn area of, surpassing the Zaca Fire to become the largest complex fire of 2007. Initially igniting in Witch Creek Canyon, near Santa Ysabel, the Witch Creek Fire rapidly spread westward, fanned by powerful Santa Ana winds, and consumed large portions of San Diego County. On October 25, the Witch Fire merged with the Poomacha Fire to the north, near Palomar Mountain, before also merging with the smaller McCoy Fire on the next day. The Witch \u2013 Poomacha Complex Fire was the last fire of the 2007 October wildfires to be extinguished, with the Poomacha Fire being contained on November 13. During its duration, 80\u2013100 feet- high flames were reported by fire officials in the Witch Fire, and the Witch Fire exhibited the characteristics of a firestorm at its height. On the morning of October 22, 2007, about a day after the Witch Creek Fire had ignited, residents were ordered to evacuate through the Reverse 911 system. Eventually, the Witch Creek Fire led to the evacuations of 500,000 people, 200,000 of whom lived within the City of San Diego. This evacuation came almost four years to the day after the Cedar Fire of 2003. The Witch Fire was a major contributor to the mass evacuations across much of Southern California at that time, which saw 1,000,000 residents evacuate, becoming the largest evacuation in California history. The Witch \u2013 Poomacha Fire caused at least$ 1.3 billion( 2007 USD) in insured damages alone, becoming the costliest wildfire of 2007. As of 2018, the Witch Fire is the ninth- largest wildfire in modern California history, as well as the fifth- most destructive wildfire on record in California.\nDocument[2](Title: Taddeo Manfredi) Taddeo Manfredi (1431 \u2013 c. 1486) was Lord of Imola from 1448 until 1473.

His reign saw the last flowering of the Komnenian restoration, during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival. Eager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with the Pope and the resurgent West. He invaded the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, although unsuccessfully, being the last Eastern Roman Emperor to attempt reconquests in the western Mediterranean. The passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire was adroitly managed. Manuel established a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader states of Outremer. Facing Muslim advances in the Holy Land, he made common cause with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and participated in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt. Manuel reshaped the political maps of the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of Hungary and Outremer under Byzantine hegemony and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east. However, towards the end of his reign Manuel's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended Seljuk position. Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II , Myriokephalon proved to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks. Called \"ho Megas\" (translated as \"the Great\") by the Greeks, Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, John Kinnamos, in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of \"the most blessed emperor of Constantinople\" in parts of the Latin world as well. Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him. Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the dynasty he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.\nDocument[3](Title: Beyg Kandi, East Azerbaijan) Beyg Kandi( also Romanized as Beyg Kand\u012b) is a village in Nazarkahrizi Rural District, Nazarkahrizi District, Hashtrud County, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

Deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding Predynastic Period (before 3100 BC) and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs. Predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures. Some of these images, such as stars and cattle, are reminiscent of important features of Egyptian religion in later times, but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities. As  Egyptian society grew more sophisticated, clearer signs of religious activity appeared. The earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era, along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities: the falcon that represents Horus and several other gods, the crossed arrows that stand for Neith, and the enigmatic \"Set animal\" that represents Set.\nDocument[2](Title: Yannick Noah) Born in Sedan, in the north of France in 1960, Yannick Noah is the son of a Cameroonian footballer, Zacharie Noah, and his French wife Marie-Claire.

Grace Moore enjoyed chart success with the song in 1934 reaching a peak position of number 15. She also made a live recording accompanied by a pianist, Gibner King, as an encore after presenting some pieces with Willem Mengelberg and the Concertgebouw Orchestra on June 23, 1936.

The whole settlement was owned by British Coal and a decision was taken, along with Derbyshire County Council, to transfer ownership of the 52 properties to a housing trust, construct a new settlement of 56 properties to the north of the site affected by methane, and move all the residents. Construction was completed by 1995 when the old Arkwright Town was demolished. Part of the deal with British Coal included the use of open cast mining on a 100- acre site which began in November 1993 and continued for some years. A new nature walk was established in 2010 using the uninhabitable waste land that was once used as a railway line.\nDocument[4](Title: Black diamond rattlesnake) Black diamond rattlesnake may refer to:\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Chronicles Of A Dive Bomber?": [

Evans was born at Compton Beauchamp in the English county of Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), on 25 March 1781. His father, the Rev. Lewis Evans, vicar of Froxfield, Wiltshire, was a well-known astronomer, and held for many years the professorship of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He married Ann, eldest daughter of Thomas Norman. The second son, Arthur, received his education at the college school, Gloucester, of which his uncle and namesake was head-master, and here he was known as \u2018The Bold Arthur,\u2019 from his remarkable personal courage. He went into residence at St John's College, Oxford, 23 October 1800, and proceeded B.A. 21 February 1804, M.A. 1820, and B.D. and D.D. 1828. In addition to his knowledge of classical languages, Evans became versed in Hebrew, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Icelandic. He had musical talent, and was a performer on several instruments. As an artist he sketched in pencil, crayon, and sepia, and his cattle pieces were of eminent merit. He studied geology and botany, and his knowledge of Greek, Roman, and English coins, of which he had a large collection, was considerable. He was ordained to the curacy of Hartpury, Gloucester, in August 1804, and after receiving priest's orders in September 1805, was in the following month appointed professor of classics and history in the Royal Military College, then lately established at Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and he removed with the college to Sandhurst in October 1812. Resigning this appointment in 1822, he went to Britwell, near Burnham, where he prepared pupils for the universities, and served the curacy of Burnham until 1829, when he accepted the head-mastership of the free grammar school at Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. Unusually Evans was one of the few headmasters of the Dixie Grammar School to be appointed other than by the local Dixie baronets. The Bishop of Lincoln, John Kaye, appointed Evans since in 1829 the 8th Baronet was only a child of 13. The schools' commissioners reported Evans' tenure as one of the most successful in the school's history. While resident at the Dixie Grammar School he held successively the curacies of Bosworth, Carlton, and Cadeby between 1829 and 1841. He never derived from his clerical profession more than \u00a3100 a year and as a schoolmaster he was eminently successful.\nDocument[2](Title: The Manhattans) The Manhattans are an American popular R&B vocal group.

There have been several proposals of this nature from the mid-20th century onwards. During the French colonial era, a district of Montreal existed in the French Province of Canada. During the 19th century, Americans sometimes referred to the Province of Quebec as the Province of Montreal. The Roman Catholic church also divides Canada up into ecclesiastical provinces, one of which being the Ecclesiastical Province of Montreal. During the prelude to the Confederation of Canada in the 1860s, some proposals were made to divide up Lower Canada( the current province of Quebec) into multiple provinces, the one with the most currency being to create the provinces of Montreal, Eastern Townships and Quebec. One of the earlier modern proposals for the Province of Montreal dates from the late 1960s, when it was proposed that\" Mr. Montreal\", Mayor Jean Drapeau, having many successes, and having Montreal as the economic engine of the Province of Quebec, become the premier of a new province, due to the way that Montreal tax dollars were spent outside of the region, to little benefit to Montrealers. Following the renewed rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement in the 1990s, efforts revived to create a Province of Montreal. Roopnarine Singh of Montreal founded the Movement for the 11th Province of Montreal in this era. The era before and after the referendum of 1995 also produced proposals to split the western Ottawa Valley region, the Eastern Townships of Quebec along the US border, and English- speaking parts of Montreal( such as the West Island and Westmount) into a Province of Montreal. This proposal was made by the\" partitionist movement\", which demands the right for minorities to secede from Quebec if Quebec secedes from Canada. In the wake of the referendum, prominent lawyer and then- federalist Guy Bertrand led a court fight to allow for the creation of the Province of Montreal if Quebec were to secede. West Virginia was used as an example to support the position in public.\nDocument[3](Title: Mount Frakes) Mount Frakes is a prominent shield volcano marking the highest elevation in the Crary Mountains, in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica and is the third highest volcanic elevation on the continent.\nDocument[4](Title: Grimoald the Elder) Grimoald I( 616\u2013657), called the Elder( in French,\" Grimaud l' Ain\u00e9\"), was the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia from 640 to 656.

Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.\nDocument[2](Title: Charles Allwright) Charles Russell Spencer Allwright (11 June 1888 \u2013 May 1966) was an English professional football outside right who played in the Football League for Bristol City.\nDocument[3](Title: Renegades) Renegades or The Renegades may refer to:\nDocument[4](Title: R\u00f3is\u00edn O) R\u00f3is\u00edn O is an Irish singer, songwriter, and musician.

He joined his brothers in the Mezzogiorno around 1053, arriving with his half-brothers Mauger and William. He was certainly present at the Battle of Civitate in that year. In that year, Humphrey, his brother the count of Apulia, gave Mauger and William the Capitanate and the Principate, respectively, with the title of count. When Mauger died later that decade (in 1054, according to Goffredo Malaterra), the county passed to William, who gave it to Geoffrey. In 1059, his brother Robert Guiscard, Humphrey's successor over Geoffrey, who was older, but had not been in the south as long, helped him quell a revolt in the Capitanate. He also ruled the region around Loritello, where his son Robert was invested as count, and he expanded his domains into those of the pope, conquering Gissi in the Abruzzi. His death is a matter of confusion. The \"Breve Chronicon Northmannicum\" states, on the authority of Goffredo Malaterra, that he died in 1063, but the chronicler apparently confused the many Geoffreys of the period. He probably died circa 1071. He had been married in Normandy and he had three sons from that union: the aforementioned Robert; Ralph, who inherited Catanzaro; and William, who inherited Tiriolo. In the Mezzogiorno, he married, like his eldest brother William Iron Arm, a niece of the Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno, Theodora of Capaccio, daughter of Pandulf, lord of Capaccio, Guaimar's brother. From this second marriage was born at least one son, named Tancred, who was alive in 1103 and 1104. He also had a son, of unknown parentage, named Drogo or Tasso .\nDocument[4](Title: Kittur Chennamma) Kittur Chennamma (23 October 1778 -- 21 February 1829) was the Rani of Kittur, a former princely state in Karnataka.

Born in Oxford, Wise worked his way up as a mariner in the East India Company's Marine Service from midshipman in 1819 to chief officer in 1831, and then a supercargo in the China trade. His logbooks from voyages in the Castle Huntly, Astell, and Elizabeth are preserved at the National Maritime Museum. He invented several schemes related to speeding travel between England and the East, publishing a book proposing the use of steam and a' propellor' in 1839, a' Plan for the Acceleration of the China Mails'( i.e. their conveyance from Suez via Ceylon to Hong Kong direct) submitted to her Majesty's Government 14 September 1843, and advocating a canal across Siam in 1859. By 1838, he was settled in London and he is principally known for his subsequent involvement with James Brooke: he helped fit out the ship for his 1839 voyage and became the agent in London to the now Rajah of Sarawak in 1841. This relationship soured around 1847 when the Eastern Archipelago Company was set up at considerable advantage to Wise who contributed rights handed to him by Brooke to mine coal in Labuan in return for fees, equity, and the job of Managing Director. The Rajah also blamed Wise for his loss of money when the firm of Melville& Street collapsed in 1848. Legal wrangles instituted by the Rajah established that the EAC was undercapitalised and only got its charter by very creative accounting, in which officials acquiesced. Fraudulent or not, the company was ambitious, but struggled until finally being wound up in 1857. Wise lost money as a shareholder in the fraudulent Royal British Bank, which had had the same founding Chairman as the Eastern Archipelago Company, one John MacGregor MP. He died in Hampstead in 1866, leaving a wife, Elizabeth, two daughters( Henrietta Elizabeth b.1848 and Harriet Grace b. 1850), and' effects under \u00a3 1500' in his will. Elizabeth died 26 March 1872, at 27, Fairfax- road, South Hampstead, aged 62.\nDocument[4](Title: Around the Fur) Around the Fur is the second studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on October 28, 1997 by Maverick Records.

Mithridates was the first son of Roman Client Monarchs Aspurgus and Gepaepyris. His younger brother was prince and future King Cotys I. He was a prince of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry. He was the first grandchild and grandson of Bosporan Monarchs Asander and Dynamis and Roman Client Rulers of Thrace, Cotys VIII and Antonia Tryphaena. Through his maternal grandmother Antonia Tryphaena, he was a descendant of Roman triumvir Mark Antony. Tryphaena was the first great granddaughter born to the triumvir. Through Tryphaena, Mithridates was also related to various members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Through Aspurgus, Mithridates was a descendant of the Greek Macedonian Kings: Antigonus I Monophthalmus, Seleucus I Nicator and Regent, Antipater. These three men served under King Alexander the Great. Mithridates was named in honor of his ancestor King Mithridates VI of Pontus. Mithridates VI was the paternal grandfather, of his paternal grandmother Dynamis. Little is known on the early life of Mithridates. When Aspurgus died in 38, Mithridates had become joint ruler with his mother, Gepaepyris. Sometime before 45, the Roman Emperor Claudius, had given Mithridates the whole Bosporan Kingdom to rule. Claudius recognised and appointed him as the legitimate Bosporan King. In 45 for unknown reasons Claudius, deposed Mithridates from the Bosporan throne and replaced him with his younger brother Cotys I. Claudius had withdrawn the Roman garrison under Aulus Didius Gallus from the Bosporan Kingdom and a few Roman cohorts were left with the Roman Knight Gaius Julius Aquila in the Bosporan. Mithridates despised the situation. He mistrusted Cotys I, Aquila and attempted to regain his throne. Mithridates was able to entice the leaders of the local tribes and deserters into his allies. He was able to seize control of the local tribes and collect an army to declare war on Cotys I and Aquila. When Cotys I and Aquila heard news of this war, they feared that the invasion was imminent. Both men knew they had the support of Claudius. Mithridates with his army, engaged in war with Cotys I's army and Aquila's battalions, in a three-day war, which Cotys I and Aquila won unscathed and triumphant at the Don River. Mithridates knew that resistance was hopeless and considered an appeal to Claudius. Mithridates turned to a local tribesman called Eunones, to help him. Eunones, sent envoys to Rome to Claudius with a letter from Mithridates. In Mithridates\u2019 letter to the Emperor, Mithridates greeted and addressed him with great honor and respect from one ruler to another ruler. Mithridates asked Claudius for a pardon and to be spared from a triumphal procession or capital punishment. Claudius wasn't sure how to punish or deal with Mithridates. Mithridates was captured and brought to Rome as a prisoner. He was displayed as a public figure beside the platform in the Roman Forum along with his guards and his expression remained undoubted. Claudius was impressed with Mithridates\u2019 mercy from his letter and allowed Mithridates to live. He was spared from any capital punishment and was exiled. Mithridates lived as a destitute exiled monarch until his death. He never married nor had children.\nDocument[3](Title: Spectre (2015 film)) A sequel to Spectre will begin development in spring 2016.

She was one of five children of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford and Mary Fawkener, daughter of William Augustus Fawkener, sometime envoy extraordinary at St Petersburg and close friend of Empress Catherine. She received no formal education, but was tutored by a governess in French, Greek, Italian and Latin. In 1847, she was embroiled in a scandal when caught in a summerhouse with a notorious rake, George Smythe MP, heir to a peerage. Smythe refused to marry her, and her parents' actions and statements destroyed her reputation. In 1847 she married a cousin twenty years her senior, one Reginald Henry Nevill (d. 1878), a grandson of the 1st Earl of Abergavenny and produced six children, only four of whom survived beyond childhood. She travelled extensively and cultivated a large circle of literary and artistic friends, with a sprinkling of politicians, including James McNeill Whistler, Richard Cobden, Joseph Chamberlain and Disraeli, whom she greatly admired. She was however, never received by Queen Victoria. In 1851 the Nevills acquired a large Sussex property, 'Dangstein' near Petersfield. Dorothy Nevill turned the estate garden into a horticultural landmark. Her exotic plants were housed in seventeen conservatories and were the subject of numerous articles in journals on horticulture. Through her plants she became friendly with both William and Joseph Hooker at Kew, and supplied Charles Darwin with rare plants for his researches. Dorothy was particularly known as an orchid grower, leading to a correspondence with Darwin that began in November 1861 when he wrote to ask for specimens to further his research towards his pamphlet on orchids. Nevill was delighted to comply, and was duly acknowledged with a presentation copy. She kept exotic birds and mammals on the estate, farmed silkworms and maintained a museum of her collections. After her husband's death, when he left all his money to their surviving children to curtail her expenditures, she moved to 'Stillyans' near Heathfield in Sussex which she rented from one of her botanical friends Doctor Robert Hogg. She was a noted conversationalist - The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the right place, but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment. - and leading society hostess, her salons attracting celebrities and politicians. She served on the first committee of the Primrose League and wrote a number of volumes of memoirs: Lady Dorothy died at her home at 45 Charles Street on 24 March 1913, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 8 September 1998. Her son, Ralph Nevill, wrote \"Life and Letters of Lady Dorothy Nevill\" (1919). Her daughter, Meresia Dorothy Augusta Nevill (1849\u20131918), was also a dedicated worker for the Primrose League. She served for many years as treasurer of the \"Ladies' Grand Council\" and died in London on 26 October 1918.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Lydia Knott or Maria Dul\u0119bianka?": [

The Spanish word \"loma\" means \"rise/low hill\". It was the property of Captain Richard Parks Thomas, a veteran of the Civil War and Berkeley businessman. Today, it is entirely a residential area. Although hilly throughout, its average elevation is about 614 feet (187 m). Captain Thomas' home was located on the site of what is today Greenwood Terrace. Some of the large trees here were originally planted by Captain Thomas and managed to survive the devastating fire of 1923 which swept through this part of Berkeley. Thomas enclosed his vast property with a low, whitewashed fence on its north, west and south sides, leaving the east side---the upper hillside---open. Captain Thomas was the owner of the Standard Soap Company in West Berkeley, president of the California National Bank of San Francisco, and owner of the Berkeley Ferryboat Line. He had a reputation as a friend of the working man and an eccentric character, and was probably the first person who inspired the nickname for the district: \"Nut Hill\". An old map includes a notation that he kept an illegal still on his property. He devised a scheme for an aerial tramway running from the Berkeley flatlands to the hills. Every Fourth of July, he fired off an old civil war cannon from \"Fort La Loma\", a plaza he constructed up the hill from his home. The site is today occupied by \"Hume Cloister,\" also known as \"Hume Castle\" on Buena Vista Way, named for Samuel James Hume and his wife, who had architect John Hudson Thomas design a reduced-scale replica of a cloister in Toulouse, France. In the 19th century, a stone quarry was opened at the head of Codornices Creek, abutting the north boundary of the La Loma Park tract. Some of the rock quarried here had a pinkish hue and was used to tint the concrete sidewalks and pathways throughout parts of North Berkeley, a practice that has been maintained by the City to this day, albeit using tint from other sources. The quarry was closed by the 1940s. In the late 1960s the quarry was made into a public park, \"Glendale-La Loma Park\". A number of notable people have lived in the La Loma Park/Nut Hill area over the years, including many professors from the University of California, Berkeley, among them, J. Robert Oppenheimer and his nemesis-colleague, Edward Teller. Famed San Francisco Bay Area architect Bernard Maybeck made his home here, as well as the homes of several others in the neighborhood, a fact memorialized by Maybeck Twin Drive off of Buena Vista above La Loma. Further up Buena Vista is a structure known as the Temple of the Wings with its Grecian columns, an early 20th-century bohemian hangout. A former public school, Hillside Elementary School is located in the La Loma district on the block bounded by Le Roy Avenue, Buena Vista Way and La Loma Avenue. It is registered as a local historic landmark. The present structure was built after the 1923 fire destroyed its predecessor, located on the southwest corner of Le Roy and Virginia Street. Hillside was closed as a public school both because of a declining school-age population and because it sits immediately adjacent to the Hayward Fault, which runs directly behind it on La Loma Avenue. Upon being subdivided and developed, some residents of the district formed the La Loma Improvement Club. One of their efforts included subsidizing the northward extension of the Euclid Avenue streetcar line from Hilgard to the Berryman Reservoir, which today is adjacent to Codornices Park and the Berkeley Rose Garden. The Euclid line was first constructed in 1903 as an extension of the Telegraph Avenue streetcar line, and originally terminated at Hilgard and Arch streets. The extension to the Berryman Reservoir (Rose Street, now Rose Walk) was completed in August 1910. A subsequent further extension was made in 1912, across Codornices Canyon, by means of a trestle for both streetcar and autos. The line was built to Regal Road and remained active until the end of all streetcar service in 1948.\nDocument[2](Title: Spectre (2015 film)) A sequel to Spectre will begin development in spring 2016.

He was the son of the Kan\u014d Mitsunobu, who lost a great deal of the main Kan\u014d school's patronage and prestige. Sadanobu was Mitsunobu's only son and seventh head of the Kan\u014d house descending directly from founded Kan\u014d Masanobu. It was the intention of Mitsunobu's brother, Kan\u014d Takanobu, to have his son, Kan\u014d Tan'y\u016b, remain in Kyoto as designated heir to his father's sub-branch of the Kano school workshop. However, Tan'y\u016b accepted the title of \"goy\u014d eshi\" in 1617 and began to plan his atelier in Edo, most likely with the Tokugawa sh\u014dgun's approval. This moved Tan'y\u016b's younger brother, Kan\u014d Naonobu, up as to succeed the family workshop in Kyoto upon Takanobu's death. However, in 1630 the city of Edo was flourishing and Naonobu was also made \"goy\u014d eshi\" and given his own parcel of land at Takegawach\u014d in Edo, where he then built his residence and studio. The main Kan\u014d-school workshop, led by Sandanobu by this time, remained in Kyoto, either by instruction of the \"sh\u014dgun\" or Sandanbou's own will. However, he had no brothers or children he could designate as heir by the time of his passing in 1623. As a result of Sadanobu leaving no heir, the Kyoto workshop fell into the hands of another Kan\u014d Takanobu child, Kan\u014d Yasunobu. Although Yasunobu was adopted into the main Kyoto house upon Sadanobu's death, sometime during 1624\u20131643 he too was appointed \"goy\u014d eshi\" by Tokugawa and moved to Edo to build his workshop known as Nakabashi. However, Yasunobu did not give up his claim to headship of the main house in order to make his move and still considered his branch the main Kan\u014d house.\nDocument[2](Title: Jo\u00e3o de Aquino) Jo\u00e3o de Aquino( born June 23, 1945) is a Brazilian guitarist and composer.

Destroying the Temple was not among Titus' goals, possibly due in large part to the massive expansions done by Herod the Great mere decades earlier. Titus had wanted to seize it and transform it into a temple dedicated to the Roman Emperor and the Roman pantheon. The fire spread quickly and was soon out of control.

Based on the British post-apocalyptic comic series of the same name by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett that was originally published in \"Deadline\" magazine, the film stars Lori Petty, Naomi Watts, Ice-T and Malcolm McDowell. \" Tank Girl\" is set in a drought-ravaged Australia, years after a catastrophic impact event. It follows the antihero Tank Girl (Petty) as she, Jet Girl (Watts), and genetically modified supersoldiers called the Rippers fight \"Water & Power\", an oppressive corporation led by Kesslee (McDowell). After reading an issue of the \"Tank Girl\" comic she had received as a gift, Talalay obtained permission from \"Deadline\"s publisher Tom Astor to direct a film adaptation. She selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer, and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during the making of the film. \" Tank Girl\" was filmed primarily in White Sands, New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by Courtney Love, and the Rippers' makeup and prosthetics team was headed by Stan Winston. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget. Financially unsuccessful, \"Tank Girl\" recouped only about $6 million of its $25 million budget at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics. Martin and Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film. Talalay blamed some of the film's negative reception on studio edits over which she had no control. Despite the box-office failure of the film, it has been cited as an example of a comic-book film with a cult following, and it is noted for its feminist themes.\nDocument[3](Title: H Project) H Project, also Hashima Project or Project Hashima , is a 2013 Thai horror film directed by Piyapan Choopetch.\nDocument[4](Title: Andrejs) Andrejs is a Latvian masculine given name.

From 1239 until his death, he was the ruling Lord of Conches- en- Ouche and Mehun- sur- Y\u00e8vre. He was the eldest of five sons of Robert of Courtenay, Lord of Champignelles( \u2020 1239), and his wife Matilda of Mehun. From his parents he inherited the castle of Conches and Mehun. On 25 August 1248, he sailed with his cousin, King Louis IX of France, from Aigues- Mortes to Egypt to fight the Seventh Crusade, during which he died. Most historians think he died during the battle for the city of Al Mansurah on 8 February 1250. On that day, Count Robert I of Artois led a vanguard of Crusaders in a spontaneous attack on the city. The vanguard was caught in a trap set by the defending Mamluks and all attackers were killed. However, the chronicler Jean de Joinville maintains Peter of Courtenay died on an earlier date. After the conquest of the Egytion port city of Damietta in June 1249, a large part of the crusader army camped outside the city wall, until they were ready to march to Al Mansurah in the autumn. The Sultan of Egypt offered a reward of one gold solidus for the head of each crusader. During the night, Saracens would sneak into the Crusader camp, kill sleeping Crusaders in their tents, and steal their severed heads. According to Joinville, Peter of Courtenay was the victim of one such attack. However, Joinville may be mistaken. One should consider that he wrote his chronicle decades after the fact, and that Peter de Courtenay is mentioned twice later in the chronicle, in connection with the Battle of Al Mansurah.\nDocument[3](Title: Vicki Lee Taylor) Vicki Lee Taylor( born 10 August 1984) is an English theatre and television actress.

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\nDocument[4](Title: New York City) Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record 56 million tourists in 2014, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.

Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king. Much of John's later, negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al-Nasir - a story which is considered to be untrue by modern historians.\nDocument[4](Title: Blue Bloods (season 8)) Blue Bloods (season 8) Country of origin United States No. of episodes 22 Release Original network CBS Original release September 29, 2017 (2017 - 09 - 29) -- present Season chronology \u2190 Previous Season 7 List of Blue Bloods episodes\n\nQuestion: Are the movies Blood: The Last Vampire (2009 Film) and Jamesy Boy, from the same country?": [

This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's instantaneous field. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a 180 degree change in phase. If the conductor is 1\u20444 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back.

Due to the frequent absence of governors Samuel Vetch and Francis Nicholson, Caulfeild often acted as governor for extended periods between 1711 and his death. Caulfeild was born to an English family in Ireland. He was the younger son of William Caulfeild, 2nd Viscount Charlemont and the daughter of the Archbishop of Armagh. He entered the military, serving in Spain during the early years of the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1710, his regiment was sent to North America, where he took part in Francis Nicholson's successful expedition against Port-Royal, the capital of French Acadia. The next year he served in Admiral Hovenden Walker's disastrous expedition to Quebec. He impressed General John Hill, the commander of the expedition's land forces, and was appointed by Hill to command the garrison at Annapolis Royal (as Port-Royal had been renamed) and serve as deputy to Governor Samuel Vetch. Caulfeild was formally commissioned as Nova Scotia's lieutenant governor in October 1712. Vetch was absent from the province between October 1711 and June 1712, during which time Caulfeild was acting governor. Nicholson was also commissioned governor in October 1712, but his commission did not arrive in North America until 1713. In October of that year Nicholson, who was in Boston performing other duties, directed Caulfeild to assume command. Nicholson was absent during most of his time as governor, only briefly visiting the province in 1714. In 1715 Nicholson was replaced as governor by Vetch, but Vetch never came to the province again. Caulfeild governed the province in Vetch's absence until his (Caulfeild's) death in early 1717. While acting as governor, Caulfeild was involved in several attempts to obtain oaths of allegiance to the British Crown from the Acadian French. He was unsuccessful in this endeavour, although he did obtain statements of neutrality from them upon the accession of King George I. Caulfeild incurred significant personal debts in maintaining the garrison at Annapolis Royal, and was highly critical of actions by Nicholson that he saw as divisive during Nicholson's brief stay in the province.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released more recently, Moscow Pride '06 or My Favourite Fabric?": [

Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 \u00b0C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.\nDocument[4](Title: Grenzaa) Grenzaa or Schoonebeker Diep is a river on the border of Lower Saxony, Germany and Drenthe, Netherlands, near the town Twist.

It was published in Chicago by the general executive board of the IWW from 1921 to 1926, under various editors. The precursor of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" was the\" One Big Union Monthly\". The editor of\" One Big Union Monthly,\" John Sandgren, used his position to wage war on the Communists in the IWW. When his editorials became too sectarian, the IWW replaced him as editor in 1931, and changed the name of the publication to the\" Industrial Pioneer.\" The new editor was a Communist, however, and this alienated the non-Communist majority of IWW members. He was removed as editor in 1922. By the end of 1923, the IWW publications\" Industrial Pioneer\" and\" Industrial Worker\" were both nearly bankrupt. An organizer with experience in the Oklahoma oil fields, Frank Gallagher, became business manager for both. The\" Industrial Pioneer\" lived on, but after the 1924 split in the IWW, the union's decline as an actual labor organization is visible in the\" Industrial Pioneer,\" which became more purely educational and historical in flavor. In the words of IWW historian Melvyn Dubofsky, the\" Industrial Pioneer\" is \u201c one of the finest examples of the poetry, prose, fiction, art, and socioeconomic analysis produced in America \u2019s past by self- educated working- class radicals. \u201d The\" Industrial Pioneer\" reflected the strong influence of Marxism within the IWW, as well as an activist emphasis on workers \u2019 emancipation through control of industry. One academic article that refers to the\" Industrial Pioneer\" describes this intellectual culture of the IWW using the library of John Edwin Peterson, a rank- and- file Wobblie: \u201c Articles on the economic and technological development of the modern railway industry in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" were studied along with Pullman production manuals for the day when workers like Peterson would take over production. \u201d This focus on analyzing the nuts and bolts of capitalist industry went hand in hand with a desire to eliminate the wastefulness endemic to capitalism. In 1920, the IWW created the Bureau of Industrial Research to address such issues, in part due to the influence of the technocratic ideas of Howard Scott. In 1921, a series of articles by or about the Bureau appeared in the\" Industrial Pioneer\". Some of the regular features of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" were a section called \u201c The Question Box, \u201d where readers wrote in to have their questions answered, a humor section called \u201c Wobbles, \u201d a poetry section, numerous cartoons, and a page advertising subscriptions to the magazine. In 1923, for example, one could order an annual subscription to the\" Industrial Pioneer,\" and receive a book such as Karl Marx's\" Capital, Volume I\" along with the subscription, for a total of$ 3.25. Prominent IWW cartoonists such as Maurice Becker and Dust were regularly featured in the magazine. A good deal of space was often devoted to fiction and poetry. As the initial announcement in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" \u2019s first issue makes clear, the magazine dedicated itself not just to addressing labor and economic issues, but to providing a forum for \u201c proletarian art. \u201d The topic of Communism was clearly important for the IWW. The first, pro-Communist editor of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" published articles by Communists like Solomon Lozovsky and Karl Radek, but was not simply preaching Bolshevism. While he is uncritical of Communist tactics in Russia, he makes clear that purely economic action is called for in the United States. A later editor, writing an editorial on the death of Lenin in 1924, provides a typical Wobblie assessment: he praises Lenin \u2019s idealism, but notes that Lenin could not save the top- heavy \u201c workers \u2019 dictatorship, \u201d which rested on the misconception that \u201c all power resides in the state. \u201d Other topics treated in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" include relations between the sexes( Jennie Wilson,\" Modern Romance,\" May, 1923 issue), evolutionary theory( J. Howard Moore, \u201c Savage Survivals in Higher Peoples, \u201d June, 1923 issue), immigration( \u201c Some Anti-Immigration Fallacies, \u201d October, 1923 issue), and race relations( \u201c The Negro\u2014A Subject Race, \u201d April, 1924 issue). The\" Industrial Pioneer\" published some noteworthy figures in American labor history, including Eugene V. Debs, Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Ricardo Flores Magon, and Upton Sinclair. Upton Sinclair, for example, was involved with the free speech fight that grew out of a strike in San Pedro in 1923, and the August, 1923 issue of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" covers these events. Due to Sinclair \u2019s advocacy for free speech, the editor of the\" Industrial Pioneer\" wrote to Sinclair, and Sinclair wrote an article on\" Civil Liberties in Los Angeles,\" which criticized arrests for\" criminal syndicalism.\" In addition, \u201c The national office of the IWW began to give space in the\" Industrial Pioneer\" to reviews of Sinclair \u2019s literary efforts and sought to enlist him as a California speaker in its campaign for amnesty for political prisoners. \u201d\nDocument[3](Title: Let's Call the Whole Thing Off) Ella Fitzgerald -- on Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook (1959), on the 1983 Pablo release Nice Work If You Can Get It, and in a 1957 duet with Louis Armstrong on Ella and Louis Again.\nDocument[4](Title: Guillot of Paris) Guillot or Guiot of Paris was a late 13th or early 14th century French poet, author of the\" Le Dit des rues de Paris\"( dated to 1280 \u2013 1300).\n\nQuestion: Where did the composer of song Let'S Call The Whole Thing Off die?": [

The story is set in the 1830s at Rugby School, a public school for boys. Hughes attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842. The novel was originally published as being\" by an Old Boy of Rugby\", and much of it is based on the author's experiences. Tom Brown is largely based on the author's brother George Hughes.

As an adult, he regularly donates funds to the Covington Protestant Children's Home where he was raised. After high school, McAnally fulfilled his mandatory military service with the United States Air Force and attended the University of Cincinnati for two years, studying electrical engineering.

As a licensed trainer working at California racetracks, in 1958 he got his first win at Hollywood Park Racetrack and in 1960 at Santa Anita Park he got the first of his more than 2,000 stakes race wins. He is noted, perhaps because of his childhood experiences, for patiently looking after horses with unique quirks such as the one- eyed Cassaleria, and the tail- less Sea Cadet. As well, he conditioned Silver Ending, a\" worthless\" horse bought for$ 1,500 who under McAnally's care won a number of stakes races including the Arkansas Derby and the then GI Pegasus Handicap.

John Henry came under McAnally's care at age four having earned$ 239,613. For McAnally he won 27 of his 45 races and earned$ 6,358,334. Other Hall of Fame horses McAnally trained were Bayakoa, who won back- to- back Breeders' Cup Distaffs in 1989 and 1990 and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse both years. Two years later, he conditioned his third Hall of Famer, another filly named Paseana who also won the Breeders' Cup Distaff in 1992 and who too was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse Eclipse for two years running. McAnally's best result in the American Classic Races was a fourth in the 1980 and 1982 Kentucky Derby, a fourth in the 1989 Preakness Stakes, and a fifth- place finish in the 1989 Belmont Stakes.

From 1109 to 1130, he was also Count of Winzenburg and from 1122 to 1138, he was Count of Reinhausen. He was also Landgrave of Thuringia from 1111 to 1130 and Margrave of Meissen from 1124 to 1130. And finally, he was high bailiff of Corvey Abbey. He was a son of Count Meginhard IV of Formbach, and his wife Matilda, a daughter of Count Elli II of Reinhausen. At a young age, he moved in with his maternal uncle, Bishop Udo of Hildesheim. In Hildesheim, he attended the cathedral school. At the age of sixteen, he travelled with his uncle to Mainz, to be presented to the emperor on 9 November 1099. He was the first member of the family to call himself \"of Winzenburg\", after Winzenburg Castle, southeast of Alfeld, which he received as a fief from his uncle Udo. He was an advisor of Emperor Henry V and became very powerful during Henry's reign. In 1109, Henry V sent him to Rome, as a member of a diplomatic mission. In 1111 or 1112, he became the first Landgrave of Thuringia, after it was split off from the Duchy of Saxony. He fulfilled his obligations as bailiff of Corvey Abbey from a distance. When the sons of Count Widekind I of Schwalenberg attacked the abbey, Herman remained inactive. In the Investiture Controversy, he sided with the Pope. This meant that he had to flee to the area where he was born, on the upper Inn. He made a large donation to the G\u00f6ttweig Abbey. In 1122, his uncle Herman III of Reinhausen died in Formbach, and thereby the Counts of Reinhausen died out in the male line. As his closest relative, Herman I inherited Reinhausen and he also became bailiff of Reinhausen Abbey, which his maternal ancestors had founded. Later that year, his father died, and Herman I inherited Windberg and Formbach as well. He also became Count of the Leinegau. In 1130, he came into conflict with Burchard I of Loccum, an advisor of Emperor Lothair III, about the construction of Burchard's castle. Herman I had Burchard assassinated on a cemetery. On 18 August 1130, during the Diet of Quedlinburg, Herman was outlawed for this murder, and all his fiefs were revoked:\nHerman I and his sons Herman II and Henry retreated to Winzenburg Castle, and defended it for several months against the army the Emperor had sent. They surrendered on 31 December 1130. Herman I was arrested and brought the Blankenburg. He was then held in custody in the Rhineland for several years. In 1134, he was released and charged with defensive duties in Holstein. He was commander of Segeberg fortress, where he died in 1137 or 1138. His death was mentioned in a document about the family that founded Reinhausen Abbey, written by abbott Reinhard sometime between 1153 and 1156.

It was first presented at the 1999 SEMA Show. It is essentially a redesigned Prowler which addressed some of the complaints and problems existing Prowler owners had. The lack of cargo space in the Prowler was universally lamented, so the Howler addressed this by elongating and squaring off the back end, creating a moderate sized trunk. The Prowler was only available as a 3.5 L V6 that was rated at~ 250 hp at its highest. For what was considered to be a modern\" hot rod\", this was not considered to be enough power, so the Howler was given a 4.7L V8- which had nearly the same horsepower, but had significantly more torque. The engine is mated to a five speed manual transmission, instead of the Prowler's four speed automatic. This freed up some room in the undercarriage to enlarge the gas tank for the thirstier V8. The Howler also has a removable hardtop instead of the traditional ragtop of the Prowler. The top is manually removed, and can be stored in a compartment behind the seats. Though the concept was appreciated by most Prowler enthusiasts, the low sales volume of the Prowler and the ultimate demise of the Plymouth nameplate ensured that the Howler was never made into a production vehicle.\nDocument[3](Title: Pixie Geldof) Little Pixie Geldof( born 17 September 1990) is an English model and singer.
